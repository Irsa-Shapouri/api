https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurabegleybloom/2024/01/03/ranked-the-25-safest-airlines-in-the-world-according-to-airlineratingscom/,The 25 Safest Airlines In The World,"What are the safest airlines in the world for 2024? As travelers gear up for another year of adventure and business, this question is top of mind. AirlineRatings.com, an airline safety and product rating review site, has the answer in its new ranking of the 25 safest airlines in the world.
AirlineRatings.com rates the safety and in-flight product of 385 airlines using its own unique seven-star rating system. In making its evaluation, the site considers a comprehensive range of factors, including serious incidents, recent fatal accidents, audits from aviation’s governing and industry bodies, industry-leading safety initiatives, expert pilot training assessment, fleet age and more. However, the evaluation leaves out such things that airlines have no control over, such as bird strikes, turbulence injuries, weather diversions and lightning strikes.
In past years, the site issued a list of the top 20 airlines; this year, it expanded the list to 25 of the largest and best-known carriers. “This year we went for a top 25 because the margins were so small between these airlines,” Geoffrey Thomas, the editor-in-chief of AirlineRatings.com, told me in an interview.

Capturing the top spot for 2024 is Air New Zealand, which edged out the competition, setting a new benchmark in airline safety and operational excellence. Air New Zealand also won in 2022. “Air New Zealand operates in some of the most challenging weather environments which test pilot skills,” says Thomas. “Wellington is one of the most windy airports in the world, while Queenstown is a huge navigation challenge.”
Another hallmark of Air New Zealand: “The airline has focused on the latest technology and its aircraft are state of the art in that respect,” says Thomas.
Coming in second on the list is Qantas, which won in 2023—though, according to Thomas, the safety margin was very small between Air New Zealand and Qantas. “Between Air New Zealand and Qantas there is only 1.5 points—it’s incredibly close,” says Thomas.
What pulled Qantas down: “Qantas slipped on fleet age, which the airline will address in 2024 with new fleets arriving,” says Thomas.
International carriers dominate the list of safest airlines. When it comes to U.S. carriers, only one is on the top 10 list: Alaska Airlines, which comes in number 10. (The airline slipped two points from 2023, when it ranked number eight). Hawaiian Airlines ranks number 21—a big drop from 2023 when it was number 12. American Airlines ranks number 22 (down from number 19 in 2023) and United Airlines ranks number 25 (down from number 14 in 2023).
“The U.S. carriers rankings are dragged down by the fleet age of their aircraft, however all have major replacement programs in place but it will take time for that to reflect in the rankings,” says Thomas.
And as he points out: “The rankings of all airlines include incidents against flights and fleet age. However the scoring was very tight.”
When it comes to the low-cost carriers, Jetstar—an Australian airline owned by Qantas—comes in number one. The top-ranking low-cost U.S. carrier is Frontier, which ranks number six beating out Southwest (at number nine), Sun Country (at number 14) and Spirit (number 15) and JetBlue (number 17).

The highly anticipated event will occur at the SAP Centre in San Jose, CA, at 10 am Pacific on January 17th. And we have a hint on the South Korean company’s focus.

Curiously, the focus of the teaser is not on the widely expected Galaxy S24, S24+ or S24 Ultra smartphones, although Samsung has confirmed that the Galaxy S Series will be part of the event. Instead, the focus is on Galaxy AI. Samsung has previously announced Samsung Gauss, an AI platform with three key modules; ""Gauss Language for understanding human language and crafting natural responses, Gauss Code assists software development for code descriptions and creating test cases, and Gauss Image allows the creation of and the modification of images.""
No doubt, Gauss will be one of the tools that will help deliver on the promise that “Galaxy AI is coming.""
The Galaxy S handsets are a key part of the proposition, with the press release noting that “[Samsung will] unveil the latest premium Galaxy innovations, providing an all-new mobile experience powered by AI. ""
The new handsets will be powered by Samsung's latest Exynos 2400 chipset or a tweaked Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 tailored for the Galaxy S24 platform, depending on the territory. The Samsung community will be looking to see if the Exynos handsets can finally match the performance and efficiency of the Qualcomm-powered option. Both chipsets are tailored towards optimizing AI and ML routines running solely on a device or working alongside cloud-based services.
The Galaxy S24 Ultra is also expected to launch with a new S-Pen stylus and feature a titanium chassis to increase durability while reducing the overall weight of the flagship.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnarcher/2024/01/02/lg-reveals-2024-oled-tv-range/,LG Reveals 2024 OLED TV Range,"There are few if any AV-related announcements each year more eagerly anticipated than LG’s annual revelation of its new OLED TV range. So I’m pleased to say that day has come early this year, ahead of the start of the 2024 CES in Las Vegas next week. And while LG’s new OLED range perhaps looks set to be more of an iterative improvement over 2023 rather than the revolutionary leap we got with last year’s G3 series, there’s still lots of exciting-sounding stuff for serious AV fans to look forward to.
Given the leap forward for WRGB technology last year’s LG G3 models gave us with their use of of Micro Lens Array technology (as part of what LG calls its Brightness Booster Max technology, to reflect the fact that the MLA hardware is just a part of what makes LG’s premium OLED picture quality tick), let’s look first at LG’s new G4 range.
LG's new G4 series will build on the Brightness Booster Max technology introduced on last year's G3 ... [+] range with an ultra-powerful new processor. There's a new matching soundbar for the G4s, too. Photo: LG
The main picture improvement here is set to come from a new processor that LG claims is so big a leap over its predecessor that they’ve named it Alpha 11 AI instead of the Alpha 10 engine we’d expected to follow from 2023’s Alpha 9 processor. If you want some numbers to go with the Alpha 11 AI hype, LG claims the new chip will offer four times the AI performance of its predecessor, 1.7x the graphics performance, and 1.3x the general processing power - all partnered with 2.5GB of RAM.
The biggest single bit of news regarding Alpha 11 is that LG’s AI Picture Pro deep learning-powered image enhancement system can now work across all sources, including those connected to the TV via HDMI, rather than only working with broadcasts and some streaming services as it did before.
The new AI Picture Pro system carries the latest versions of the genre and scene analysis, AI Super Resolution, Noise Reduction and OLED Dynamic Tone Mapping Pro engine features (the latter of which breaks the image into thousands of analysis blocks to make its tone mapping more effective) we’ve seen in AI Picture Pro before. But Alpha 11 also introduces two potentially key new AI Picture Pro features: Object Enhancing By Visual Perception, and AI Director Processing.
The Object Enhancing By Visual Perception feature is claimed to analyze each and every pixel in the picture to better detect and more effective treat different objects in an image to help make it in more life-like (so key objects gain more emphasis, for instance). The AI Director Processing attempts to apply to whatever you’re watching the colour theory (where colour is used to enhance emotions) used during content mastering and grading to give images more power.
These two new features might sound problematic for AV purists who would rather their TV just show as accurately as possible the images it’s receiving. However, given the power and extent of the AI deep learning that’s behind these features, I suspect they’re probably going to be worth at least experimenting with, even for die-hard cinephiles.
The Alpha 11 processor introduces a couple of potentially critical new elements to the G4’s AI Sound Pro system, too: A virtual 11.1.2-channel upmixer that can even be applied to stereo sources, and a new Voice Remastering system that’s able to use AI to extract voices from audio mixes so that their clarity can be enhanced without affecting the rest of the mix. These new features join previous AI Sound Pro features of Adaptive Sound Control (which optimizes sound playback in real time based on analysis of the content), AI Acoustic Tuning to optimise the sound for your room set up, and a Dynamic Sound Booster for making the sound more dynamic and powerful.

While it’s not clear if LG has implemented any significant improvements to the hardware side of the Micro Lens Array system that helped the G3s deliver such a game-changing increase in brightness last year, LG does state that its latest Brightness Booster Max technology, which also incorporates a light boosting algorithm along with the better ‘light control architecture’, will make the G4s even brighter than the G3s. It’s not absolutely clear by how much; LG just states that the G4s will be up to 70% brighter than ‘conventional’ (which is to say, basic entry level models such as LG’sB series) OLED screens.
One other great bit of progress for the G4 range finds the Brightness Booster Max system extending to the 83-inch model; it’s no longer restricted to the 55, 65 and 77-inch sizes in the range. The only G4 model that won’t benefit from Brightness Booster Max technology is the new king-sized 97 incher.
Gamers have a new feature to look forward to, meanwhile, in the shape of support for 144Hz games if you have a PC capable of delivering such refresh rates. LG claims that this feature makes its new ‘Evo’ OLED models (which include new C4 and M4 models as well as the G4s) the first TVs to officially support both Nvidia G-Sync and 144Hz. They also support AMD FreeSync, of course.
The M4 models mentioned back there will actually represent LG’s flagship OLED TVs for 2024. As anyone familiar with the M3 TVs LG introduced relatively late on in 2023 might expect, the new M4 range will continue to be built around LG’s Zero Connect system, where an external connection box sends pictures up to 4K/144Hz HDR (making them the first TVs to do this without compression) wirelessly to their gorgeously minimalistic partner OLED screens. The M4s will improve on their M3 predecessors by sporting the latest Alpha 11 AI processor, and again all screen sizes bar the 97-inch one will benefit from Brightness Booster Max technology.
The M4 and G4 screens will both feature so-called ‘One Wall Designs’ ideally suited to wall mounting, and five-year warranties as a sign of LG’s confidence in their longevity.
One other new feature exclusive to LG’s M4 and G4 OLED screens will be a new 4-screen multi-view system unlocked by the power of the Alpha 11 processor. This lets you divide the screen into four smaller screens showing different sources, with the power of the new processor increasing the range of source combinations you can set up (including live TV, HDMI, YouTube, CAM, Browser, Miracast, Spotify and Airplay) and improving the interface you use for selecting your Multiview sources.
The new C4 range
Rounding out LG’s so-called evo range of premium OLED panels will be the C4 range. As with the C series in 2023’s LG OLED range, the C4s won’t benefit from the full Brightness Booster Max technology, with some C4 screen sizes instead falling back to regular Brightness Booster technology. This reflects a specific combination of a slightly improved version of the Alpha 9 processor deployed on last year’s C3 models, and LG ‘evo’ panels that deliver more brightness than the basic OLED panels used in LG’s entry-level OLED range without getting the extra brightness boost made possible by MLA technology. Again, LG suggests there should be a small brightness enhancement for the C4s over the C3s, but can’t provide any exact figures for this.
As with previous years, the 42 and 48-inch C4s won’t get the Brightness Booster technology - though LG does confirm that they will definitely be brighter than their 2023 counterparts.
The C4s lose the 5 year warranty of the G4 and M4 series, drop the multiview support to two screens from four, and switch away from a One Wall design to an Ultra Slim Design. They do, though, retain both the 144Hz gaming and far-field voice control (where you can talk to the TV without needing to press a button on your remote handset) features delivered by the M4s and G4s.
The LG C4 range in 2024 will be available in 42, 48, 55, 65, 77 and 83-inch screen sizes.
Wrapping up LG’s OLED offering for 2024 will be the entry-level B4 series. Available in 77, 65, 55 and 48-inch screen sizes, these models top out at 120Hz support rather than 144Hz, and step down to a new Alpha 8 AI 4K processor, which LG rather vaguely describes as ‘inherited’ from last year’s Alpha 9 AI 4K system.
There’s no far-field voice recognition on the B4s either, and they lose all of the Brightness Booster technologies available from the C4 up, meaning they’ll be significantly less bright than their siblings. They do, though, still get the Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos support enjoyed by all of LG’s more premium 2024 models, as well as the latest much-improved webOS platform including the two-screen Multiview system carried by the C4s.
LG has yet to provide launch date or pricing information for its 2024 OLED range, but rest assured I’ll bring you this information on my Forbes channel as soon as LG reveals it.

When Samsung launches the three new Galaxy S24 smartphones later this month, there will be exciting free offers for those who pre-order one of its flagship phones.
Galaxy S23, Galaxy Watch 5, and Galaxy Buds (Photo by Joan Cros/NurPhoto via Getty Images) NurPhoto via Getty Images
Samsung is widely expected to host a Galaxy Unpacked event on January 17th, where the Galaxy S24, Galaxy S24+ and Galaxy S24 Ultra will be launched. The handsets should go on general sale in key territories before the end of the month, but there will be a pre-order window with several free offers to encourage sales.
Update: Tuesday, January 2. Samsung has now announced the next Galaxy Unpacked event, where it will launch the Galaxy S24, S24+ and S24 Ultra. As well as confirming the time of 10 am Pacific on January 17th at the SAP Center in San Jose, CA, Samsung announced a special offer for those reserving a handset ahead of the launch… a pre-order on a pre-order, if you will.
Echoing a similar offer from the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Z Flip 5 launch, customers who reserve a handset between the 2nd and 16th of January will receive a $50 credit towards purchasing a handset from the S24 range.
There are no details on the pre-order offers yet; these will probably become clear during the launch event, but recent reports suggest two options will return to entice consumers to the new Galaxy flagships.

The first is “double your storage,” which will allow consumers to step up to the next model’s storage at no extra cost—if you buy the 128 GB model of the Galaxy S24 you’ll receive the 256 GB model right through the range to those buying the 512 GB model of the Galaxy S24 Ultra receiving the 1TB model. You can view it as a double your memory or a discount on the models with more storage; either way, it's an enticing option for those on a budget.
Then you have the bonus accessories. Samsung is expected to offer every Galaxy S24 buyer a discount on the Galaxy Buds Fan Edition wireless buds and Galaxy Watch smartwatches. The latest Buds FE were launched late last year alongside the Galaxy S23 FE smartphone, offering active noise cancellation and a transparency mode for $99. The Galaxy Watch 6 was launched in the summer of 2023 with improved battery life, slimmer bezels, and WearOS 4 for $299.
It remains to be seen which peripherals will be offered with which phones and how much discount will be offered. For comparison, Google offered a free set of Pixel Buds Pro for those pre-ordering the Pixel 8 smartphone and a free Pixel Watch 2 for those pre-ordering the Pixel 8 Pro.
Finally, you have the exclusive models available only through Samsung’s website.
Samsung will have a wide range of colors across the S24 portfolio, but some will only be available through the website. Those looking for the highest specced Galaxy S24 Ultra must order through Samsung’s website if, as expected, the 1 TB storage option will only be available online.
Recent leaks on the potential European pricing suggest that the Galaxy S24 and S24+ will be marginally cheaper than equivalent S23 models. At the same time, the Galaxy S24 Ultra will be more expensive than last year’s Galaxy S23 Ultra.
Now read about the three key features that will drive sales of the Galaxy S24 family...","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/659300f714eba79a0feffef8/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3626,2040,x221,y122,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-01-02 19:49:06
https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2024/01/02/google-pixel-8-pro-spare-parts-ifixit-right-to-repair/,Official Spare Parts For Your Pixel 8 Pro Now On Sale,"Google announced it would offer spare parts for the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro alongside a massive seven years of software and security support. The parts to repair your own smartphone are now available.
Google's Pixel 8 Pro Ewan Spence
Several official spare parts are available through the popular iFixit website, with landing pages for the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro parts set up. The ‘big ticket’ item many will look for first is the screen. The Pixel 8 screen and digitzer is available for $159, or $229 for the Pixel 8 Pro version. A new battery for either Pixel is $42. These can all be bought individually or as part of a fix kit, which includes the necessary tools to replace the part, including suction handles, pry tools, cleaning cloths, and 4mm bits.
Some parts are not available. The one most likely to cause an issue is the lack of a replacement USB-C port. This is part of the main circuit board, and the main board is not available for purchase.
While this may be a disappointment, it should not negate the positive benefits of offering official parts and repair guides. Pixel owners now have a supply of parts available for the same seven years as the software updates. Google is highlighting the benefits of an open repair program to the rest of the smartphone industry.
Now, we need everyone else to open up and let consumers have the right and the tools required to repair their own smartphones.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2024/01/02/dr-gpt-84-say-chatgpt-got-their-diagnosis-right/,Dr GPT: 84% Say ChatGPT Got Their Diagnosis Right,"Most Americans seem willing to trust AI with a bigger part of their medical needs. getty
Doctors and healthcare officials can debate the value of AI in health as much as they’d like. People are already voting with their fingers, and using ChatGPT for health care insights, diagnoses, and help with understanding what their doctors tell them. According to a new study of 2,000 American adults, 52% of us have given our symptoms to an AI system like ChatGPT. Of those, the vast majority say that ChatGPT got it right.
“Over half of the respondents (52%) stated they have given a list of their symptoms to a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT, looking for a diagnosis,” says the company that ran the survey, UserTesting. “Of them, 81% have been given a diagnosis from the LLM, and when asked for their diagnosis after consulting a doctor, 84% said the diagnosis was accurate.”
Americans appear especially likely to trust AI.
While almost half of English people and a third of Australians say they don’t trust AI for any health-related tasks, only 6% of Americans agree. While some of what we’d trust AI to do is simple tasks like scheduling appointments or coordinating with pharmacies, 53% of us “would trust AI to recommend treatment plans.”
I’ve personally used AI to decode medical jargon and understand a medical diagnosis after getting a full-body MRI. And I recently used ChatGPT to confirm that what I was feeling over the holidays was likely a flu.
It shouldn’t be a shock that Americans are looking for healthcare solutions outside of traditional doctor-patient and hospital arrangements. 26 million don’t have health insurance, and among those that do, expensive co-pays or difficulty getting an appointment make alternatives attractive. Plus, many rural and inner city areas in the United State may entirely lack local and convenient healthcare options regardless of your insurance status.
“The growing prevalence of healthcare deserts or even just ordinary lack of access in America means that AI will be incorporated into the healthcare journey to provide care at the scale that we need as the country ages,” says Lija Hogan, who leads research strategy at UserTesting.
What would we trust AI with?
Recommend treatment plans: 53% Monitoring sleeping patterns: 53% Scheduling doctors appointments: 52% Monitoring heart health: 51% Diagnosing chronic illnesses like heart disease: 48% Coordinating with pharmacies to fill prescriptions: 47% Monitoring blood pressure: 42% Diagnosing Covid: 42% Providing fertility information: 40% Diagnosing colds and flus: 40%
Of course, many of us have wearable devices and tools that do parts of this already: Apple Watches, Fitbits, or others. And 78% say that we believe AI and tech companies will protect the health data we share with them.
However, when we’re really sick, we probably need a doctor and specific medical tests for diseases that can only be detected with blood tests or other exams that consumer-grade wearable medical technology. Consumer tech may be coming for that too—see the COR ‘FitBit for your blood’ that I covered in March of 2022—but there are some things only doctors can do. Few of us have a personal MRI machine, or X-ray.
The best option may be doctors and AI working together: an ever-present frontline of health information delivered seamlessly via wearable tech and smart AI, and a secondary layer of defense provided by experts taking advantage of all the data and insights that smart systems can provide.
""Doctors and patients need to figure out together how AI can play the best role in healthcare journey,” says Hogan. “This means that we have to figure out the right guardrails to ensure people are getting high-quality advice in the right contexts and how to connect patients to providers.”
That connected, seamless system of medical professionals and healthcare-trained AIs, however, has yet to be delivered.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6594aa9fb0ae4932027051de/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-01-02 19:32:58

It’s the very first Wordle Wednesday of 2024! I hope everyone had a wonderful holiday break, a lovely Christmas and a very, very happy New Year’s! I have a good feeling about this year. 2023 was something of a bust for me, but if nothing else I think I ended it on a high note, and so I tread into the dawn of a new year with some hope for the future. Not too much, mind you, but some.
Rebellions are built on hope.
In any case, it’s Wednesday and that means it’s time to solve a riddle, brain teaser or logic puzzle. Here’s today’s:
A farmer sends his daughter on a small boat across the river to the market with a pouch of coins. With her pouch of coins she purchases a mangy dog, a chicken and a bag of corn. When she brings her purchases back to her small boat, she realizes that it is so small that she’ll only be able to carry one of her three purchases across at a time. She is faced with a dilemma, however: If she leaves the chicken with the corn, the chicken will eat the corn. If she leaves the mangy dog with the chicken, the mangy dog will eat the chicken. How does she get all three items across without any of them becoming a meal?
If you solve this puzzle, let me know on Twitter or Facebook. I’ll post the answer here on my blog (be sure to follow!) in tomorrow’s Wordle Guide.
Okay, let’s solve this Wordle!

After each Wordle I solve I head over to the Wordle Bot homepage to see how my guessing game was.
Can you solve today’s phrase? Play Now
I got a bit of a kick out of how my own guesses went down today. I was thinking bout guilt because somebody sent me an angry message about my coverage of the Jonathan Majors case, and one of the only words left that I could think of after that was trial. How ironic! I obviously had to use that for my second guess—and oh how sweet it would have been if that had been today’s Wordle!—but came back with three greens and one yellow ‘R’.
At this point, the answer was obvious: twirl for the win. Huzzah!
Today’s Competitive Wordle Score
Once again, I get 1 point for guessing in three and 0 for tying the Bot. I’ll take it!
Today’s Wordle Etymology
The word ""twirl"" originates from the Middle English ""twirlen"" or ""twirlig"", which in turn comes from the Old English ""thwirl,"" meaning ""to turn around."" This Old English root is connected to the Old Norse ""þvarr,"" meaning ""stubborn,"" suggesting a sense of something being twisted or turned with force.
The evolution of ""twirl"" reflects a common pattern in English etymology where words evolve through gradual phonetic and semantic changes over time, often influenced by the languages of neighboring cultures and invading forces, like the Norse in the case of Old English. This word particularly encapsulates the action of turning or spinning something in a light, quick manner, which is consistent with its etymological roots in the idea of turning or twisting.

Have you been seeing ads for an “airdrop” of the cryptocurrency XRP on platforms like YouTube and X over the past couple of months? They feature Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse explaining how people can receive XRP for free if they just send a particular crypto wallet some XRP first. But it’s all a scam using artificial intelligence to make it look like Garlinghouse is saying things he never actually said.
I first noticed the scam ads on YouTube back in November, which is unusual because the social media platform has a number of safeguards in place to protect against obvious scams. But recently I’ve been seeing the ad so much on X, formerly known as Twitter, that it’s seemingly taking up half of the ads in my feed.
The ads appear to use AI to make it look like Garlinghouse is saying things he didn’t say. And it’s somewhat convincing until you really look at his mouth and notice the lip movements don’t quite match what he’s saying.
Garlinghouse himself confirmed back in November that the ads are scams.
“There’s been an uptick in deepfake scam videos (ex below) overlaying new words with old video footage from Ripple’s events (@YouTube are you asleep at the wheel again?!). Reminder: don't trust, verify (all approved messaging will only come from official Ripple accounts),” Garlinghouse tweeted on November 16, 2023.
New technologies that allow anyone to sample someone’s voice and create a video that makes it look like they’re saying things they never said have accelerated in recent years. And plenty of people are getting scammed by the ads, as you can see from testimonials of people who said they lost money on X.
“I just got scammed 2k in xrp on an ad here on X. Saying they would double it back to me. I should have looked it up....” one user wrote on X.
X has struggled in the past with scam cryptocurrency ads, including some that even use photos of X owner Elon Musk. And it’s not clear when the company will take crypto scams seriously, since they’ve become such a big problem.
X did not immediately respond to questions emailed Tuesday about why scam ads for free Ripple seem to have skyrocketed recently. I’ll update this post if I hear back. But for now, just know that anyone who’s promising to send you cryptocurrency if you just send them some crypto first, is almost certainly operating a scam.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65949b5aea75550602c919da/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-01-02 18:29:52

A 2023 study published in the Journal of Happiness Studies examined the effects of “work rumination” on romantic relationships. Work rumination refers to the tendency to repeatedly dwell on work-related thoughts, problems or situations even when one is not actively working.
Due to work rumination, one may develop the inability to mentally disengage from work matters. This can include rehashing work-related conversations or events with a partner or constantly analyzing past actions and decisions made at work. Researchers suggest that work rumination takes attention away from one’s partner, thereby affecting the quality of the relationship.
On the other hand, talking about work can also be an essential source of support that helps a person work through rumination, signaling the need for a balance in emotionally engaging with work once the work day ends.
Here are two signs that work rumination is affecting your relationship and how to improve it.
1. You Only Bring Up Work
One of the most evident signs of work rumination impacting one’s relationship is if conversations with a partner consistently revolve around work. Whether it’s discussing office politics, venting about work stress or analyzing professional challenges, when an individual repeatedly steers discussions toward work-related topics, it leaves little space for personal or intimate conversations, undermining the emotional connection between partners.
Researchers suggest our minds can remain fixated on workplace matters even in moments meant for relaxation or intimacy due to the cognitive load imposed by work thoughts on one’s capacity for attention, especially if they are burdened by a heavy workload.
Based on the load theory of selective attention, researchers suggest that whether work thoughts are positive or negative, they compete for the limited mental resources a person has, reducing their ability to attend to anything or anyone else. This lack of attention has been linked to lower relationship satisfaction for both individuals in the relationship.
The non-working hours where such rumination occurs usually coincide with the only available face-to-face interaction time romantic partners have in a day. One’s work and personal life must then also vie for limited time resources, compromising the quality as well as quantity of meaningful engagement and positive, affectionate interactions with a partner.
The study confirmed that on the days one of the partners had lower work rumination, they paid more attention to their partners, leaving both partners feeling more satisfied in the relationship.
2. You Are Less Emotionally Available Than Before
Emotional availability for one’s partner also requires emotional availability to oneself, which is affected by work rumination. Excessively dwelling on work matters can make an individual more irritable, frustrated, anxious and exhausted, lowering their well-being and their ability to be emotionally present.
Research shows that a cognitive preoccupation with work hampers an individual’s engagement in private activities and reduces their psychological availability for their partners, contributing to marital tensions, anger or even withdrawal.
The lack of emotional availability can create emotional distance and reduce one’s “perceived partner responsiveness,” referring to how caring, validating and supportive one’s partner perceives them to be, which is crucial for relationship satisfaction.
A lack of emotional availability diminishes the empathetic support one can offer a partner and makes them less attuned to the other's needs and desires. An ongoing conversation about work stifles opportunities for the other partner to share their own feelings or experiences and restricts the exploration of the full spectrum of emotions—such as joy, sadness, fears and aspirations— that contribute to a nuanced and intimate connection.
How To Save Your Relationship From The Cycle Of Work Rumination
Here are a few ways to address the impact of work rumination on your relationship.
Prioritize self-care . Managing work-related stress is essential to curbing rumination. Reflect on why work may be taking up excessive mental space for you and what needs to change for you to feel more at ease. Prioritize self-care by engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation.

Dedicate quality time to your relationship without work interruptions. Avoid overcommitting to work responsibilities that can encroach on personal time. Create rituals for connection. Establish routines or rituals dedicated solely to your relationship, like having a weekly date night or making dinner together as well as taking some time to reconnect with yourself after work, so that you can feel more present after.
Conclusion
The persistence of work-related thoughts outside the workplace diminishes an individual’s ability to fully engage with their partner during shared personal time, ultimately influencing the quality and satisfaction of their relationship. Recognizing the signs and taking proactive steps to create work-life boundaries is vital to maintaining and nurturing one’s relationship.

Frontdesk, a startup that managed more than 1,000 furnished apartments across the United States, laid off its entire 200-person workforce Tuesday after attempts to raise more capital failed, TechCrunch exclusively learned from sources familiar with internal happenings at the company. The mass layoff comes just seven months after the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based startup acquired smaller rival Zencity.
The layoffs, which included full-time, part-time workers and contractors, occurred Tuesday afternoon during “a two-minute Google Meet call,” according to one employee who was among those attending the virtual meeting.
During that call, Frontdesk CEO Jesse DePinto told employees that Frontdesk would be filing for a state receivership, an alternative to bankruptcy, according to the sources.
The company has not responded to a request for comment. When calling the number on the company’s website, a recording says: “Currently, Frontdesk is unavailable.

Frontdesk, which was founded in 2017, had raised about $26 million from investors such as JetBlue Ventures, Veritas Investments and Sand Hill Angels, according to Crunchbase.
Frontdesk went out for a bridge round, attempting to sell investors on a new plan of doing full building management, sources told TechCrunch. That tactic didn’t work out and the company couldn’t keep operating. Frontdesk was apparently still optimistic about its ability to raise more capital; the startup had posted on LinkedIn openings for several jobs, including a chief of staff role, just two months ago.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/former-anthemis-partner-soft-launches-new-fintech-focused-venture-firm/,Former Anthemis partner soft-launches new fintech-focused venture firm,"Ruth Foxe Blader has left her role as partner at Anthemis Group after nearly seven years to start her own venture firm, Foxe Capital, TechCrunch learned exclusively today.
Blader is joined by former Anthemis investment associate Kyle Perez. Sophie Winwood is serving as an operating partner. Winwood previously co-founded WVC:E, an organization that pledges to promote “inclusion, empowerment and integration of VC globally,” with Blader.
Over the years, Blader says she has led investments in more than 50 fintech startups, including Lemonade, Branch, Elevate, Flock, Mesh and Amplify.
A desire to invest independently was the main driver behind Blader’s decision to leave London-based Anthemis, Blader told TechCrunch in an interview. The investor says she got a taste of what that was like after she and Winwood started WVC:E in April 2022.
Foxe Capital will continue investing on behalf of Anthemis, serving as a sub advisor for the firm, and essentially managing the vehicle she was hired to run in 2017. When all that capital has been deployed — Blader projects that it will stop writing checks into startups this year out of the Anthemis funds — Foxe Capital will focus on fundraising. Meanwhile, Foxe Capital is being compensated for continuing to run the fund on behalf of Anthemis, according to Blader.
Anthemis continues to have an economic interest in that vehicle but does not own any part of the management company and will only have a continued economic interest in Foxe Capital if it chooses to be an LP when the firm fundraises in the future, according to Blader.
An Anthemis spokesperson confirmed the move, sharing via email: “Ruth wanted to be an independent manager. Anthemis proudly backs her. She will continue to support us as an investor across her current Anthemis funds.”
While Blader travels back and forth currently between France and New York (Blader has been living in Europe/New York for 15 years), Foxe Capital is based in New York City. Its investments will be global, with the U.S. as its home market.
“We have the most familiarity [outside of the U.S.] with Europe but have also done investments in India, Cameroon and LatAm,” she told TechCrunch. “We’ll be looking to invest opportunistically globally.”
Restructuring and a failed SPAC
Anthemis has had its share of upheaval — and turnover — in recent times.
Last April, TechCrunch broke the news that Anthemis Group had completed a restructuring that resulted in its letting go of 16 employees, or about 28% of its staff.
A spokesperson for London-based Anthemis at the time said the move was an effort “to better reflect current market conditions and to set up the business for future growth” against its “strategic priorities.”
Also, last May, TechCrunch reported that Anthemis Group was trying to raise $200 million for a third fund. It had been in the market since 2022 and had only secured commitments of just $36.4 million. The firm separately had to scrap plans to raise a SPAC in late April.
In the past 18 months, Anthemis also saw a couple of portfolio companies stumble. In November 2022, controversy surrounding the sudden stepping down of three of Pipe’s co-founders, including its CEO, raised eyebrows. And in 2023, LGBTQ+-focused digital bank Daylight was slammed with a lawsuit by three former employees “alleging age and wage discrimination, whistleblower retaliation, and fraud.” The startup shut down later in the year.
The firm’s 2023 restructuring was not the first time it saw a management shakeup. Anthemis also made headlines in 2018 when its then-CEO and co-founder Nadeem Shaikh resigned after reportedly being the target of a sexual harassment complaint by a female employee.
Blader is not the first fintech-focused investor to venture out on her own in recent times.
Early last year, Peter Ackerson departed fintech-focused Fin Capital to co-found a new firm, Audere Capital. It is still unclear as to whether Ackerson left voluntarily or was forced to leave. A source with familiarity of internal happenings at Fin Capital alleged there was tension between Ackerson and managing partner and founder Logan Allin around portfolio company alternative financing startup Pipe — an investment into which Ackerson led and on whose board he sat. Audere has invested in five startups, according to PitchBook — only one of which is focused on financial services.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/samsungs-galaxy-s24-line-set-for-january-17-debut/,Samsung’s Galaxy S24 lineup set for January 17 debut,"Samsung’s mobile division ditched the big show unveils a while back. Gone, too, it seems, are the days when the company would save its first big phone news of the year for the weeks leading up to Mobile World Congress.
The latest Unpacked event is set for January 17 — a week and change after the close of CES. If past is precedent (as it almost invariably is), we’ll be getting our first official look at Samsung’s new mobile flagship, the Galaxy S24.
Last year’s event, held at the beginning of February, ushered in three key versions of the S23, along with a handful of Galaxy Book laptops. This being Samsung, the handset leaks have been ongoing for a couple of months now.
Renders of the S24, S24+ and the S24 Ultra don’t stray too far from their predecessors. Those devices are expected to sport 6.2-, 6.7- and 6.8-inch displays, respectively. The S24 and S24+ look to be sporting a trio of rear-facing cameras, while the Ultra bumps it up to a quartet, including the 200-megapixel sensor.
The Ultra also maintains much of the DNA the device inherited from the Galaxy Note line, including square edges and S Pen functionality. The ultra-premium model is also believed to be getting a titanium option, much like the iPhone 15 Pro Max before it.
In spite of apparently being among the first to be powered by Qualcomm’s more powerful and power-efficient Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip, leaked price sheets point at a lower price point in Europe, which could be good news for potential buyers everywhere.
This time out, the event is being held in the South Bay. It kicks off at 10 a.m. PT and will be available to stream here. If you want to reserve the device sight unseen up to January 16, Samsung will toss in a $50 “reserve credit” on preorders.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/CMC_6058.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-01-02 23:00:02
https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/tech-for-palestine-launches-to-provide-tools-and-projects-to-help-advocate-for-palestinians/,Tech for Palestine launches to provide tools to help support Palestinians,"More than 40 founders, investors, engineers and others in the tech industry are today announcing a coalition called Tech for Palestine to build open source projects, tools and data to help others in the industry advocate for the Palestinian people.
The launch of the group comes during a tense time in the region. Hamas’s October 7th attack on Israel led to the deaths of more than 1,100 individuals. The war in the Gaza Strip that followed has seen the displacement of millions of Palestinians and tens of thousands of deaths.
The Israel-Hamas war has proved divisive to the tech industry. Israel, home to a well-known technology and startup market, has seen strong support from tech individuals and institutions. In contrast, calls for ceasefires and speaking in support of Palestine have caused some to lose their jobs.
Paul Biggar, the founder of Tech for Palestine, hopes to raise more awareness of the war in Gaza, fight for a permanent ceasefire and provide ways for those who are afraid to speak publicly in support of Palestine to still offer support. It is one of the first tech initiatives to take a public stance supporting Palestine and could represent a turning point in the venture industry’s posture regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict as more people seek to speak out in favor of a ceasefire.
Biggar, the founder of the company CircleCI — last valued at $1.7 billion — formed the coalition after writing a viral blog post that criticized the lack of support the tech industry has shown Palestinians. He said that after he wrote his blog post, thousands of people reached out to him with words of support, many of them afraid to speak up themselves for fear of potential career impacts.
Among them, he said, were “dozens of people not only speaking up but who had started projects to change the industry to ensure that people speaking up for Palestine could be heard. Dozens of others were volunteering to help,” Biggar added. “I started connecting these folks together, and the [Tech for Palestine] community came together very quickly.”
The platform, still in its early days, will feature projects run by small groups and serve as a place to share resources and advice, something many pro-Palestinian tech workers are already doing privately. It has already secured names like Idris Mokhtarzada, founder of the unicorn Truebill, to help build out the platform. So far, it has created a badge for engineers to use on GitHub that calls for a ceasefire and created HTML snippets for people to use on their websites to put up a support ceasefire banner.
Biggar said there are plans to eventually work more with Palestinian organizations and help Palestinian startups with mentorship and cloud credits. TechCrunch previously reported that the war has destroyed much of Palestine’s burgeoning tech industry.
Arfah Farooq, founder of Muslamic Makers, said the last three months have changed everyone in many ways. At the same time, there has been a togetherness and activism that she has never seen before. “I’ve seen firsthand people come together to work for Palestine with nothing but their laptops from across the globe,” she said.
She decided to work with Tech for Palestine after reading Biggar’s viral blog post and has already started to share resources on how to support Palestine. “Due to the siege, we can’t go to Gaza and help on the ground, but we help regardless of where we are in the world,” Farooq said.
One engineer, who asked to remain anonymous, decided to join the coalition because this person felt suffocated at work. This person has agreed to work as an engineer and product manager to help build resources for Tech for Palestine, saying, “I hope this initiative will spark a significant shift and give people their voices back.”
A former tech brand marketer, who is also scared to speak out publicly for fear it will impact a new job search, also told TechCrunch about feeling happy to have a way to get involved with the cause.
“This period has been incredibly isolating to Arabs, Muslims and other people of color in VC and tech,” she said. “Tech for Palestine is a necessary initiative. When we are seeing mobilization around the world and the U.S. in the numbers of hundreds of thousands calling for peace and [the] humanization of the Palestinians, the tech community can no longer be silent.”
The Tech for Palestine initiative comes as the death toll among Palestinians continues to rise. In recent weeks, U.S. officials have reportedly prodded Israel to do more to protect civilians in Gaza even as they have called U.S. support for Israeli security unshakable.
Biggar hopes, at the very least, that this new coalition will augur a larger shift in people speaking up.
“The narrative has only just turned,” he said. “We are working to enable many more who feel silenced to speak out, we are only getting started.”","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1367359752.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-01-02 21:15:40

The news, announced today, confirms earlier reports from TechCrunch that Terran CEO Marc Bell was expecting at least some payment from Rivada before the close of the year.
Rivada, a German subsidiary of U.S.-based Rivada Networks, has ambitious plans to build a megaconstellation in low Earth orbit. The company contracted Terran to build 300 satellites at a total anticipated cost of $2.4 billion. The contract is Terran’s largest by far, representing the vast bulk of the company’s backlog.
While Terran did not disclose the exact payment amount, the company did say that Rivada is now up-to-date on all outstanding invoices. Terran added that it expects to receive additional incremental payments this year and that it is on track to deliver satellites in 2025 and 2026.
As a result of the payment, Terran adjusted its anticipated year-end cash balance from $38.7 million as of the end of September to an excess of $70 million by the end of December. On the whole, it’s great news for Terran Orbital, which has seen its stock crater since making its public market debut at $10.96 per share. But an incremental payment from its largest customer will no doubt help shore investor confidence as the company moves into a new year.
Terran Orbital, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol LLAP, saw a slight bump in its stock price from the news, moving from $1.14 as of previous close to $1.26 as of publication time.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1474001528.jpg?resize=1200,781",2024-01-02 21:09:48

After two years working with web3, Puma’s tech revenues remain modest, but the sportswear manufacturer intends to be ready for a more crypto-friendly future. “Web3 is a big shift in how people use the internet,” Dashkov said. Such changes to how the internet is used can lead to landscape-shifts for brands, something that Puma is more than aware of.
The company “missed the boat” on the big e-commerce and social media waves that happened in the past few decades, so it wants to be early in this space, Dashkov explained. “We don’t think the way the space exists today will be what it looks like in four or five years, but we want to be ready.”
In February 2022, Puma registered its first Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domain, as Puma.eth. ENS domains are popular among Ethereum users who want to have accessible addresses, usually related to themselves or a brand, instead of copying and pasting a string of randomly generated letters and numbers.
In June 2023, Puma launched Black Station and Black Station 2, which its website refers to as “experimental 3D spatial playground,” which is a lot of words to basically describe a metaverse. I tested out the entry page and found it to be a bit slow and confusing (disclaimer: I’m not a huge gamer, so maybe I’m missing the point, but I imagine not all Puma fans are either.) Regardless, its metaverse aims to provide consumers with a different way to interact with the brand, Dashkov said.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/m-s-8-store-ny.jpg?resize=1200,900",2024-01-02 20:19:45
https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/great-now-we-have-to-become-digital-copyright-experts/,"Great, now we have to become digital copyright experts","When news broke last year that AI heavyweight OpenAI and Axel Springer had reached a financial agreement and partnership, it seemed to bode well for harmony between folks who write words, and tech companies that use them to help create and train artificial intelligence models. At the time OpenAI had also come to an agreement with the AP, for reference.
Then as the year ended the New York Times sued OpenAI and its backer Microsoft, alleging that the AI company’s generative AI models were “built by copying and using millions of The Times’s copyrighted news articles, in-depth investigations, opinion pieces, reviews, how-to guides, and more.” Due to what the Times considers to be “unlawful use of [its] work to create artificial intelligence products,” OpenAI’s “can generate output that recites Times content verbatim, closely summarizes it, and mimics its expressive style, as demonstrated by scores of examples.”
The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.
The Times added in its suit that it “objected after it discovered that Defendants were using Times content without permission to develop their models and tools,” and that “negotiations have not led to a resolution” with OpenAI.
How to balance the need to respect copyright and ensure that AI development doesn’t grind to a halt will not be answered quickly. But the agreements and more fractious disputes between creators and the AI companies that want to ingest and use that work to build artificial intelligence models create an unhappy moment for both sides of the conflict. Tech companies are busy baking new generative AI models trained on data that includes copyright-protected material into their software products; Microsoft is a leader in that particular work, it’s worth noting. And media companies that have spent massively over time to build up a corpus of reported and otherwise created materials are incensed that their efforts are being subsumed into machines that give nothing back to the folks who provided their training data.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-GRN.jpg?resize=1200,900",2024-01-02 18:58:45
https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/steamboat-willie-mickey-mouse-public-domain/,Public domain Mickey Mouse is the first meme of 2024,"The new year marks the nerdiest holiday you maybe didn’t know about: Public Domain Day. But this year’s celebration is extra special. After years of legal battles, “Steamboat Willie,” a 1928 Walt Disney short featuring Mickey Mouse, is now public domain.
No, that doesn’t mean that you can take the character of Mickey Mouse as we know him today and do whatever you want. But, Mickey Mouse as he appears in the “Steamboat Willie” animation? That’s public domain, baby.
Every January 1, a bunch of old works of literature, music and art enter the public domain, meaning that no one holds exclusive rights to the work anymore. Some works are created to be public domain from the get-go, but previously copyrighted works become public domain because the copyright can expire over time. Copyright law differs from country to country, but to put it simply, the concept of the public domain is why there’s a Winnie the Pooh slasher film (which has a 3% rating on Rotten Tomatoes…), or a queer “Great Gatsby” retelling.
Already, there have been multiple horror movie and video game adaptations announced that will feature the version of Mickey Mouse from “Steamboat Willie.” Generally, “because I can” is not an inspiration that generates great art (see, again, the Rotten Tomatoes rating on “Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey”), but these are the situations in which life imitates a YouTube comments section: everyone wants to be “first.”
Mickey Mouse has already been remixed in certain media, like the TV show South Park, which created an egomaniacal Mr. Mouse character who is obsessed with owning everything. Mr. Mouse is an obvious rip off of Mickey, but depictions like this can be protected under a different subset of copyright law. Under fair use doctrine, some behaviors that might seem like copyright violations are legally permissible if they are transformative or satirical in nature (but of course, these are subjective parameters, which is a whole other can of legal worms).
Any notable work that enters the public domain will garner attention. But part of why there is such an excess of surprise “Steamboat Willie” adaptations is because Disney worked so hard to prevent this day from ever arriving.

“Steamboat Willie” was slated to enter the public domain in 1984, but Disney managed to extend that copyright for 40 more years through extensive government lobbying for two different copyright extension acts. First, Disney pushed for Congress to pass the Copyright Act of 1976, which delayed “Steamboat Willie” and Mickey Mouse’s public domain debut until 2004. By the 1990s, Disney continued to lobby for further extensions, which gave us the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998, making “Steamboat Willie” safe until just a few days ago.
“Many people thought that Disney would keep up this fight. But I personally don’t find it that surprising that this day has finally come,” wrote Casey Fiesler, an associate professor of information science at CU Boulder. “It was inevitable. And it would have been both a hard fight and a PR nightmare to postpone this yet again.”
Some of Disney’s most iconic works were adapted from public domain stories, like “The Little Mermaid” by Hans Christian Andersen, or the Brothers Grimm’s stories about Cinderella and Rapunzel. So, critics of Disney found its extensive lobbying for copyright extension to be hypocritical, with some even referring to the 1998 law as the “Mickey Mouse Protection Act.”
On social media, avid meme-makers derive joy from the humiliation of large corporations. It’s like a David vs. Goliath situation, in which random posters want to feel as though they, random people on the internet, can actually stand up to untouchable corporations. The internet delighted to watch as someone abused Twitter’s botched blue check system to impersonate pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and declare that insulin was free. It’s like when the Bernie Sanders mittens meme went viral, and even an Amazon corporate Twitter account posted its own Bernie meme. And when users responded by pointing out that Sanders is one of Amazon’s most vocal critics, the meme was quickly deleted.
So, the version of Mickey Mouse from “Steamboat Willie” seems to be everywhere right now. Among crypto folk, some people are already making “Steamboat Willie” NFTs, which is a good idea that definitely won’t result in any scammy behavior. And among the nihilistic meme-makers, we’re seeing AI-generated images of Mickey Mouse doing 9/11, Mickey Mouse confessing to the murder of JFK and many more extreme representations of Mickey that we do not dare repeat on this website. People don’t make these memes because they actually endorse the idea of Mickey Mouse conducting a terrorist attack, but simply because they can.
This builds upon an existing, ongoing meme, in which people use generative AI to create the most heinous representations of copyrighted media possible, like pregnant Sonic the Hedgehog, or Hatsune Miku attending the January 6 riots. Only this time, there’s really nothing stopping the Mickey memes, so long as the creator explicitly references only the version of Mickey Mouse that appears in “Steamboat Willie.”
“Steamboat Willie” itself is surprisingly a ripe source material, considering that it’s a seven-minute short with no dialogue. While we’re used to seeing Mickey Mouse as an ultra-sanitized, wholesome figure, the 95-year-old “Steamboat Willie” film shows a different side of the mouse. Mickey gets blasted in the face with cow pee, throws a potato at a parrot, turns a goat into a music box and pulls on the tails of baby pigs to use them as instruments. His personality would fit better in “Tom and Jerry” than “Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.”
“Steamboat Willie” may be the first meme of 2024, but the novelty of poking fun at Disney will only last for so long. And if people aren’t careful, they might still face the ire of the mouse.
“We will, of course, continue to protect our rights in the more modern versions of Mickey Mouse and other works that remain subject to copyright, and we will work to safeguard against consumer confusion caused by unauthorized uses of Mickey and our other iconic characters,” Disney wrote in a statement in December.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-01-02-at-9.58.27 AM.png?resize=1200,809",2024-01-02 18:16:15
https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/telegrams-latest-update-brings-a-redesigned-call-interface-that-uses-less-of-your-phones-battery/,Telegram's latest update brings a redesigned call interface that uses less of your phone's battery,"Telegram is rolling out a new update that introduces improved calls with a new design that uses less of your phone’s battery. The update also brings new animations, enhancements to the app’s bot platform and more.
The company says it has redesigned calls and added backgrounds that change dynamically based on the call’s status: ringing, active or ended. The new interface requires fewer resources than before, which means it saves battery life and works better on older devices. The update also brings improvements to call quality. Telegram says it plans to launch more improvements to connection and audio quality in 2024.
Telegram is also launching updates to its bot platform, which lets developers integrate services into the Telegram ecosystem. Bots can now react to messages and manage reactions, quotes and links, send replies to other chats or topics, and more. Bots can also get information about giveaways and boosts in channels where they are admins.
Additionally, Telegram is bringing its vaporize animation to both iOS and Android users after previously testing it with select users. The new effect plays whenever you delete a message, and is designed to bring a bit of fun to the app.
The launch of the new features comes a month after Telegram announced improvements to channels, emoji customization for reactions and stats for stories to compete better with WhatsApp, which launched its broadcast channels features to all users in September 2023. Although Telegram has had channels for a long time now, the app has to keep innovating in order to compete with WhatsApp.
Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently said in his broadcast channel in WhatsApp that the channels feature had crossed the mark of 500 million monthly active users. For context, WhatsApp has more than 2 billion monthly active users and Telegram has over 800 million monthly active users.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GettyImages-503572806.jpg?resize=1200,854",2024-01-02 17:29:52
https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/mit-scientists-are-working-on-a-vibrating-obesity-pill/,MIT scientists are working on a vibrating obesity pill,"MIT likens a new vibrating capsule to drinking a glass full of water prior to eating. Dieticians recommend the latter as a method for sending signals to your brain to simulate the sensation of being full. The researchers behind the new project further suggest it as a future alternative to surgery and GLP-1s. The latter, which includes semaglutides like Ozempic and Wegovy, are both extremely popular and prohibitively expensive, owing in large part to pharma IP laws.
MIT’s capsule has seen some laboratory success. Giving test animals the pill 20 minutes before eating reduced their consumption by around 40%, per the team. Like the glass of water trick, the capsule stimulates mechanoreceptors, which send a signal to the brain through the vagus cranial nerve. Once activated, the brain kicks off the production of insulin, GLP-1, C-peptide and PYY hormones, decreasing hunger while ramping up the digestion process.
“The behavioral change is profound, and that’s using the endogenous system rather than any exogenous therapeutic,” associate professor Giovanni Traverso notes. “We have the potential to overcome some of the challenges and costs associated with delivery of biologic drugs by modulating the enteric nervous system.”
The capsule, which is roughly the size of a standard multi-vitamin, contains a vibrating motor, powered by a silver oxide battery. After reaching the stomach, gastric acid dissolves the outside layer and completes the circuit, kickstarting the vibration.
Beyond efficacy, the team is working to determine the system’s safety. That requires a method for ramping up production and eventual human testing. “At scale, our device could be manufactured at a pretty cost-effective price point,” says post-doc researcher, Shriya Srinivasan.
Capsule-based technology treatments have been a hot category in recent years, as researchers explore ingestible sensors and even micro-robotic systems.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MIT_Obesity-Treatment-02-PRESS.jpg?w=900,2024-01-02 16:36:52
https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/early-stage-hard-tech-firm-countdown-capital-shutting-down/,Early-stage hard tech firm Countdown Capital shutting down,"Countdown Capital, an early-stage venture capital firm focused on hard tech industrial startups, will shut down by the end of March and return uninvested capital, firm founder and solo general partner Jai Malik said in an annual letter.
In the letter, which was viewed by TechCrunch, Malik says he decided to close the fund after coming to two main conclusions on the economics of early-stage hard tech investing: that “funding industrial startups is not inefficient enough to justify our existence” and that “larger, multi-stage venture firms are best positioned to generate strong returns on the most valuable industrial startups.”
In other words, that the firm would be unlikely to realize excess returns consistently based on capital limitations and swelling competition from large incumbents.
The three-year-old firm’s sudden closure suggests that there are stronger headwinds for early-stage hard tech funds than the overtly optimistic narratives about “building for America” might suggest. The incisively-written letter reads like a cold glass of water to the face.
“Despite our performance to date, I’ve concluded that new investments are unlikely to yield strong returns,” Malik says. “As a result, I no longer believe that Countdown’s existence is justified, for both our LPs and Countdown management.” Malik declined to comment on this story.
The firm has backed some of the better-known names in the aerospace and defense sector, including large satellite bus developer K2 Space, machining startup Hadrian, and cybersecurity company Galvanick. A total of 12 investments are listed on the firm’s website. Among Countdown’s LPs included Craft Ventures’ David Sacks, Banana Capital’s Turner Novak and Homebrew VC’s Hunter Walk.
Notably, Countdown was relatively early to the American hard tech Renaissance; the firm closed its first fund well before Andreessen Horowitz launched its American Dynamism practice, likely the largest and best-known U.S. fund focused on shoring up “the national interest” across sectors like manufacturing, aviation and others.
TechCrunch covered Countdown’s second $15 million fund in September 2022; at the time, Malik said that the firm was filling a void at the very early stages for capital-intensive businesses. A year and a bit on, however, it’s clear that the early-stage opportunities Malik was targeting have not shaken out as anticipated. Countdown’s first fund was $3 million.
The letter posits larger narratives about early-stage hard tech industrials investing that throw into doubt the ability of small, specialist funds to compete against multi-stage incumbents.
Malik explicitly touches on this fact toward the end of the letter, when he writes: “To be clear, we’re not bearish on venture capital or the future success of venture-scale hard tech companies at large. We’re bearish on the ability of small, early-stage funds — particularly sectionally focused ones — to continue exploiting these opportunities profitably.”
In the letter, Malik connects large multi-stage firms investing in hard tech industrial startups to the slowdown in growth in software-as-a-service (SaaS) businesses. But he says that the rate of overall value growth for industrial startups will not outpace the rate of investment from large firms. “Consequently, we think early access to the best companies for a specialized, early-stage venture firm like Countdown will become more limited,” he says. “The most successful early-stage, specialist firms may simply resemble less-profitable ‘derivatives’ of top-performing multi-stage firms, like Founders Fund.”
Malik goes on to say that he thought Countdown had or could develop competitive advantages to outcompete against other firms, multi-stage or early-stage, but that these “are unlikely to prevail.” These advantages could be things like incubation or other approaches that require more time and money than the small-AUM firm could afford.
He said that this lack of competitive advantage was already noticeable: In three cases, Countdown came close to investing in a company’s first round, only for the firm to be priced out by a larger multi-stage firm: “A 50-100% price difference at the pre-seed and seed stage is immaterial to a multi-stage firm managing billions of dollars, but can and should be the difference between a yes and no for a firm of our size.”
Another issue, Malik says, is that the top-performing industrial startups are inaccessible to early-stage firms because they are priced efficiently early on. For example, Malik estimates that Anduril, The Boring Company and Redwood Materials were priced at roughly $60 million, $1 billion and $200 million, respectively, in their first outside rounds; Countdown would’ve had to invest an enormous portion of its fund to acquire even just 3% of each company.
By the end of March, the firm will complete all pending investments, return capital, cancel all uncalled commitments and permanently cease operation apart from current asset management, Malik said.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/51870446669_f94575721f_o.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-01-02 16:36:22
https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/ev-tax-credit-eligibility-tesla-ford-chevy/,Here are the 5 EVs that qualify for the full federal tax credit in 2024,"The U.S. government has revealed the list of electric vehicles that qualify for the full federal tax credit under the newer, more stringent guidelines, and you can count them on one hand. General Motors’ outgoing Chevy Bolt, plus certain variants of the Ford F-150 Lightning and Tesla’s Model 3, Model Y and Model X are now the only EVs that are eligible for the $7,500 rebate.
Beyond that, certain variants of Rivian’s R1S and R1T, plus a handful of plug-in hybrids, qualify for $3,750. Chrysler’s Pacifica plug-in hybrid was able to stay eligible for the full credit. Otherwise, that’s all.
Until this list was published Monday, the new requirements had many people scratching their heads about what, exactly, would qualify. Even Tesla admitted in its own way that it wasn’t exactly sure.
The reason the list is so anemic is because lawmakers are trying to force the EV supply chain to shift — or at least diversify away — from China to North America in the long run. In the short term, that means automakers who rely heavily on Chinese suppliers, specifically for battery materials and components, are losing eligibility. This is on top of a few other baked-in restrictions, like the fact that the vehicles must be built in North America, and must retail for less than either $55,000 or $80,000, depending on vehicle type.
While it will be harder to find a vehicle that qualifies for the federal EV tax credit, the credit itself is much better for consumers in two key ways. First, the credit is now applied when buying the car, meaning you won’t have to wait to claim it on your tax returns.
Second, buyers no longer have to have a tax liability equal to or greater than the amount of the credit — a rule that previously kept a lot of buyers from accessing the credit in the first place. (That said, buyers still have to have certain adjusted gross income to qualify. Here’s a list of FAQs from the IRS.)
Some automakers, like GM, have said they are working on replacing components that are disqualifying their EVs from the credit, so the list could grow as the year goes on. A slew of automakers and suppliers are rushing to build new factories in North America in order to ease the burden in the years to come. But until that happens, here’s the full list of what’s eligible:
Full $7,500 tax credit
Chevrolet Bolt EV
Chevrolet Bolt EUV
Chrysler Pacifica PHEV
Ford F-150 Lightning Extended Range
Ford F-150 Lightning Standard Range
Tesla Model 3 Performance
Tesla Model Y All-Wheel Drive

https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/crowdfunding-is-actually-good/,Debunking the myth that crowdfunding is only good for cash,"Equity crowdfunding, or raising funds from both unaccredited and accredited investors, can be a great alternative to venture capital for startups. The strategy has become significantly more popular in recent years now that venture capital is harder to come by, and changes in regulations allow companies to raise more money at one time.
But even though crowdfunding is growing in prominence and offers a whole host of benefits to the startups that choose it, many VCs continue to talk negatively about the strategy. Many traditional investors feel equity crowdfunding is only for startups that can’t raise venture money. And they even deem capital raised this way as just cash that lacks the value an investor brings, be it their network that can help with hiring and connections to customers, or their own mentorship and experience.
Still, startups that have been down the crowdfunding road say that VCs are just talking their own book.
Chris Lustrino, the founder and CEO of crowdfunding data platform KingsCrowd, thinks crowdfunding definitely isn’t just for raising capital. KingsCrowd has been able to get repeat investors, customers and even talent from their crowdfunding campaigns, he told TechCrunch+, adding that he’s seen numerous other startups do the same.
“I would argue that the venture capital value-add is next to none in reality,” Lustrino said. “They want to hold on to their monopoly.”","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1191380440.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-01-02 16:00:13

https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/rivian-deliveries-slip-10-in-q4-raising-demand-questions/,"Rivian deliveries slip 10% in Q4, raising demand questions","Rivian reported Tuesday it produced 17,541 vehicles at its Normal, Illinois factory and delivered 13,972 to customers in the fourth quarter, mixed results that left investors wary and sent shares down in pre-market trading.
Rivian shares sank 9.75% to $21.17 at 1:40 pm ET.
Rivian had shown consistent growth in production and deliveries in the first three quarters of the year. And while production numbers continued on that upward trajectory in the fourth quarter, deliveries dipped by 10.2% from the previous quarter. That drop could signal softening demand for the company’s slate of premium EVs. Rivian produces four vehicles: its two consumer vehicles, the R1T truck and R1S SUV, and two versions of its commercial van.
Slowing demand for high-priced EVs has plagued automakers, forcing many to scale back production or cut prices. Rivian has managed to avoid slashing prices. If deliveries continue to fall into 2024, the automaker may have to take that strategy in an effort to boost its numbers. That would spell trouble for Rivian, which is not yet profitable.
The cost of building one Rivian vehicle continues to be a barrier to the company’s path toward profitability. Rivian’s consumer R1T and R1S vehicles sell for more than $80,000, on average. But the cost of building far exceeds any revenue it brings. In the second quarter, for instance, the company lost $32,495 on every vehicle it built.
Rivian said during its third-quarter earnings that it narrowed that per unit loss by $2,000 compared to the second quarter by simplifying its product portfolio and reducing material and labor costs. Cutting the sticker price would only put more pressure on margins.
On a full-year basis, Rivian produced 57,232 vehicles and delivered 50,122. This exceeded the automaker’s most recent full-year 2023 production guidance of 54,000 vehicles.
The company also announced that it will report fourth-quarter earning after markets close February 21.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/rivian-Your_electric_adventure_awaits._Reserve_an_R1T_228.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-01-02 14:40:40
https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/generative-ai-transforming-education-into-a-personalized-addictive-learning-experience/,"Generative AI: Transforming education into a personalized, addictive learning experience","It’s no surprise that educators have an uneasy relationship with generative AI. They fear the impact of plagiarism and machine-generated essays and the “hallucinations” — where the system confidently asserts something is true that isn’t simply because it doesn’t know any better — of tools like ChatGPT and Bard. There’s a palpable concern that generative AI will become a substitute for authentic learning: something that will help a person pass a test without the need to absorb and internalize the material.
While there is no doubt that AI has been used to circumvent the learning process, ChatGPT has already assumed the role of an ad hoc personal tutor for millions, changing learning consumption patterns and enhancing our relationship with education. The possibility of an AI-powered teaching assistant — one that mentors, encourages, and guides learners through the material in a one-to-one relationship — is within grasp. And the scalability of AI means that anyone can benefit from it.
AI can make — and, for many, already has made — learning addictive. The reasons why have little to do with cutting-edge advancements in AI and computer science and more to do with the fundamentals of what makes a learner engaged, motivated, and excited.
Growing up in Armenia, I was enthralled by the fiercely competitive math Olympiads, and my desire to win drove me to spend hours studying and practicing. Yet, as an adult, I couldn’t find that same motivation while studying math at MIT. I’ve spent a great deal of my life researching and understanding the motivations behind learning, some of which I’ve distilled into this piece and much of which led to me founding CodeSignal.
What do we mean by addictive?
Education has always been centered around the human element, and it’s hard to imagine a world where machines can replace that.
When I talk about AI making learning addictive, I’m talking about a sense of excitement and eagerness — instilling a voracious appetite for self-improvement and growth within a learner. But, more importantly, it continues long after they’ve accomplished what started their journey. Essentially, this boils down to sustained, long-term motivation. Creating self-motivated learners is a challenge that most educators face, and a mountain of educational research touches on this topic.
It’s hard to overstate the importance of motivation. Whether you’re learning to speak a new language or taking the first steps to a career in programming, learning is inherently iterative, where the learner gradually builds confidence and fluency over time. The prolific programming educator Zed Shaw once described this as “climbing a mountain of ignorance.” Those first few months — when you aren’t confident and don’t understand the subject — are the hardest, and it’s all too easy to give up. And that’s why you need an external force to encourage the learner to keep going. Confidence, ability, and perhaps even greatness are just around the corner.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GettyImages-482765551.jpg?resize=1200,720",2024-01-02 14:35:55
https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/tesla-2023-sales-figures-price-cuts/,Tesla's cheapest cars helped it notch another record year,"Tesla shipped a record number of electric vehicles in the fourth quarter to help it edge out its targets for the year. The company delivered 1.81 million EVs in 2023 and built 1.85 million, according to a Tuesday morning press release.
Those figures were slightly above the 1.8 million goal Tesla announced at the beginning of this year, and were overwhelmingly driven by the company’s most affordable EVs, the Model 3 and Model Y. The two models accounted for more than 96% of the vehicles Tesla built and shipped this year.
Tesla built nearly 500,000 cars in the fourth quarter alone at its factories in California, Texas, Germany and China, and delivered 484,507 worldwide. That includes the first few Cybertrucks, which started shipping late last year at a price tag of around $100,000. But we don’t know exactly how many Cybertrucks the company has sent to customers to date as it is lumping in those figures with Model S and X sales in an “other models” line item.
The strong finish to the year comes after Tesla saw its deliveries decline in the third quarter for the first time in a year, owing to some factory shutdowns — something that impaired CEO Elon Musk’s loftier goal of building 2 million cars this year. The company spent much of the year tinkering with its prices, starting with big price cuts, which has taken a huge bite out of its industry-leading profit margins.
Tesla’s big year is also due in large part to the company’s success in China, where competition for market share is becoming fierce due to waves of price cuts from competitors. That includes BYD, which has recently been on track to outpace Tesla’s EV global sales.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2021-Tesla-Model-Y-Goodbye-085.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-01-02 14:26:58
https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/openai-dublin-data-controller/,OpenAI moves to shrink regulatory risk in EU around data privacy,"While most of Europe was still knuckle deep in the holiday chocolate selection box late last month, ChatGPT maker OpenAI was busy firing out an email with details of an incoming update to its terms that looks intended to shrink its regulatory risk in the European Union.
The AI giant’s technology has come under early scrutiny in the region over ChatGPT’s impact on people’s privacy — with a number of open investigations into data protection concerns linked to how the chatbot processes people’s information and the data it can generate about individuals, including from watchdogs in Italy and Poland. (Italy’s intervention even triggered a temporary suspension of ChatGPT in the country until OpenAI revised the information and controls it provides users.)
“We have changed the OpenAI entity that provides services such as ChatGPT to EEA and Swiss residents to our Irish entity, OpenAI Ireland Limited,” OpenAI wrote in an email to users sent on December 28.
A parallel update to OpenAI’s Privacy Policy for Europe further stipulates:
If you live in the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland, OpenAI Ireland Limited, with its registered office at 1st Floor, The Liffey Trust Centre, 117-126 Sheriff Street Upper, Dublin 1, D01 YC43, Ireland, is the controller and is responsible for the processing of your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy.
The new terms of use listing its recently established Dublin-based subsidiary as the data controller for users in the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland, where the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is in force, will start to apply on February 15 2024.
Users are told if they disagree with OpenAI’s new terms they may delete their account.
The GDPR’s one-stop-shop (OSS) mechanism allows for companies that process Europeans’ data to streamline privacy oversight under a single lead data supervisory located in an EU Member State — where they are “main established”, as the regulatory jargon puts it.
Gaining this status effectively reduces the ability of privacy watchdogs located elsewhere in the bloc to unilaterally act on concerns. Instead they would typically refer complaints back to the main established company’s lead supervisor for consideration.
Other GDPR regulators still retain powers to intervene locally if they see urgent risks. But such interventions are typically temporary. They are also exceptional by nature, with the bulk of GDPR oversight funnelled via a lead authority. Hence why the status has proved so appealing to Big Tech — enabling the most powerful platforms to streamline privacy oversight of their cross-border personal data processing.
Asked if OpenAI is working with Ireland’s privacy watchdog to obtain main establishment status for its Dublin-based entity, under the GDPR’s OSS, a spokeswomen for the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) told TechCrunch: “I can confirm that Open AI has been engaged with the DPC and other EU DPAs [data protection authorities] on this matter.”
OpenAI was also contacted for comment.
The AI giant opened a Dublin office back in September — hiring initially for a handful of policy, legal and privacy staffers in addition to some back office roles.
At the time of writing it has just five open positions based in Dublin out of a total of 100 listed on its careers page, so local hiring still appears to be limited. A Brussels-based EU Member States policy & partnerships lead role it’s also recruiting at the moment asks applicants to specify if they’re available to work from the Dublin office three days per week. But the vast majority of the AI giant’s open positions are listed as San Francisco/U.S. based.
One of the five Dublin-based roles being advertised by OpenAI is for a privacy software engineer. The other four are for: account director, platform; international payroll specialist; media relations, Europe lead; and sales engineer.
Who and how many hires OpenAI is making in Dublin will be relevant to it obtaining main establishment status under the GDPR as it’s not simply a case of filing a bit of legal paperwork and checking a box to gain the status. The company will need to convince the bloc’s privacy regulators that the Member State-based entity it’s named as legally responsible for Europeans’ data is actually able to influence decision-making around it.
That means having the right expertise and legal structures in place to exert influence and put meaningful privacy checks on a U.S. parent.
Put another way, opening up a front office in Dublin that simply signs off on product decisions that are made in San Francisco should not suffice.
That said, OpenAI may be looking with interest at the example of X, the company formerly known as Twitter, which has rocked all sorts of boats after a change of ownership in fall 2022. But has failed to fall out of the OSS since Elon Musk took over — despite the erratic billionaire owner taking a hatchet to X’s regional headcount, driving out relevant expertise and making what appear to be extremely unilateral product decisions. (So, well, go figure.)
If OpenAI gains GDPR main established status in Ireland, obtaining lead oversight by the Irish DPC, it would join the likes of Apple, Google, Meta, TikTok and X, to name a few of the multinationals that have opted to make their EU home in Dublin.
The DPC, meanwhile, continues to attract substantial criticism over the pace and cadence of its GDPR oversight of local tech giants. And while recent years has seen a number of headline-grabbing penalties on Big Tech finally rolling out of Ireland critics point out the regulator often advocates for substantially lower penalties than its peers. Other criticisms include the glacial pace and/or unusual trajectory of the DPC’s investigations. Or instances where it chooses not to investigate a complaint at all, or opts to reframe it in a way that sidesteps the key concern (on the latter, see, for example, this Google adtech complaint).
Any existing GDPR probes of ChatGPT, such as by regulators in Italy and Poland, may still be consequential in terms of shaping the regional regulation of OpenAI’s generative AI chatbot as the probes are likely to run their course given they concern data processing predating any future main establishment status the AI giant may gain. But it’s less clear how much impact they may have.
As a refresher, Italy’s privacy regulator has been looking at a long list of concerns about ChatGPT, including the legal basis OpenAI relies upon for processing people’s data to train its AIs. While Poland’s watchdog opened a probe following a detailed complaint about ChatGPT — including how the AI bot hallucinates (i.e. fabricates) personal data.
Notably, OpenAI’s updated European privacy policy also includes more details on the legal bases it claims for processing people’s data — with some new wording that phrases its claim to be relying on a legitimate interests legal basis to process people’s data for AI model training as being “necessary for our legitimate interests and those of third parties and broader society” [emphasis ours].
Whereas the current OpenAI privacy policy contains the much drier line on this element of its claimed legal basis: “Our legitimate interests in protecting our Services from abuse, fraud, or security risks, or in developing, improving, or promoting our Services, including when we train our models.”
This suggests OpenAI may be intending to seek to defend its vast, consentless harvesting of Internet users’ personal data for generative AI profit to concerned European privacy regulators by making some kind of public interest argument for the activity, in addition to its own (commercial) interests. However the GDPR has a strictly limited set of (six) valid legal basis for processing personal data; data controllers can’t just play pick ‘n’ mix of bits from this list to invent their own bespoke justification.
It’s also worth noting GDPR watchdogs have already been trying to find common ground on how to tackle the tricky intersection of data protection law and big data-fuelled AIs via a taskforce set up within the European Data Protection Board last year. Although it remains to be seen whether any consensus will emerge from the process. And given OpenAI’s move to establish a legal entity in Dublin as the controller of European users data now, down the line, Ireland may well get the defining say in the direction of travel when it comes to generative AI and privacy rights.
If the DPC becomes lead supervisor of OpenAI it would have the ability to, for example, slow the pace of any GDPR enforcement on the rapidly advancing tech.
Already, last April in the wake of the Italian intervention on ChatGPT, the DPC’s current commissioner, Helen Dixon, warned against privacy watchdogs rushing to ban the tech over data concerns — saying regulators should take time to figure out how to enforce the bloc’s data protection law on AIs.
Note: U.K. users are excluded from OpenAI’s legal basis switch to Ireland, with the company specifying they fall under the purview of its U.S., Delware-based corporate entity. (Since Brexit, the EU’s GDPR no longer applies in the U.K. — although it retains its own U.K. GDPR in national law, a data protection regulation which is still historically based on the European framework, that’s set to change as the U.K. diverges from the bloc’s gold standard on data protection via the rights-diluting ‘data reform’ bill currently passing through parliament.)","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1173441590.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-01-02 14:13:57
https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/oral-peptides-a-new-era-in-drug-development/41404/,Oral peptides: A new era in drug development,"Researchers from the laboratory of Professor Christian Heinis at EPFL have achieved a significant milestone in drug development through oral peptides.
The research opens the door to oral peptides, a new class of orally available drugs, addressing a long-standing challenge in the pharmaceutical industry.
The research, ‘De novo development of small cyclic peptides that are orally bioavailable,’ is published in Nature Chemical Biology.
“There are many diseases for which the targets were identified, but drugs binding and reaching them could not be developed,” explained Professor Heinis.
“Most of them are types of cancer, and many targets in these cancers are protein-protein interactions that are important for the tumour growth but cannot be inhibited.”
Cyclising breakthrough in oral peptides
The study focused on cyclic peptides, which are versatile molecules known for their high affinity and specificity in binding challenging disease targets.
At the same time, developing cyclic oral peptides has proven difficult because they are rapidly digested or poorly absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract.
The research team targeted the enzyme thrombin, which is a critical disease target because of its central role in blood coagulation. Regulating thrombin is key to preventing and treating thrombotic disorders like strokes and heart attacks.
To generate cyclic oral peptides that can target thrombin and are sufficiently stable, the scientists developed a two-step combinatorial synthesis strategy to synthesise a vast library of cyclical peptides with thioether bonds, which enhance their metabolic stability when taken orally.
Heinis said: “We have now succeeded in generating cyclic peptides that bind to a disease target of our choice and can also be administered orally.
“Therefore, we have developed a new method in which thousands of small cyclic oral peptides with random sequences are chemically synthesised on a nanoscale and examined in a high-throughput process.”
The two steps, one pot method
The new method process involves two steps and takes place in the same reactive container, a feature chemists call ‘one pot’.
The first step is to synthesise linear peptides, which then undergo a chemical process of forming a ring-like structure. This is done using bis-electrophilic linkers – chemical compounds used to connect two molecular groups – to form stable thioether bonds.
In the second phase, the cyclised peptides undergo acylation, which attaches carboxylic acids to them, further diversifying their molecular structure.
The technique eliminates the need for intermediate purification steps, allowing for high-throughput screening directly in the synthesis plates, combining the synthesis and screening of thousands of peptides to identify candidates with high affinity for specific disease targets – in this case, thrombin.
When tested on rats, the oral peptides showed up to 18% bioavailability, which means that when the cyclic peptide drug is taken orally, 18% of it successfully enters the bloodstream and has a therapeutic effect.
Since orally administered cyclic peptides generally show a bioavailability below 2%, increasing that number to 18% is a substantial advance for drugs in the biologics category, including peptides.
Future ambitions of this pharmaceutical breakthrough
By enabling the availability of cyclic oral peptides, the team has opened up possibilities for treating various diseases that have been challenging to address with conventional oral drugs.
The method’s versatility means it can be adapted to target a wide array of proteins, potentially leading to breakthroughs in areas where medical needs are currently unmet.
“To apply the method to more challenging disease targets, such as protein-protein interactions, larger libraries will likely need to be synthesised and studied,” explained Manuel Merz, PhD student and leader of the research.
In the next step of this project, the researchers will target several intracellular protein-protein interaction targets for which it has been difficult to develop inhibitors based on classical small molecules.
They are confident that oral peptides can be developed for at least some of them.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Low-Res_Graphical_abstract_highresolution.jpg,2024-01-02 11:45:10
https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/nutrition-insecurity-caused-by-climate-change-to-be-reduced-with-new-policies/41405/,Nutrition insecurity caused by climate change to be reduced with new policies,"According to a new study, nutrition insecurity in sub-Saharan Africa needs to be combated with crops that are resilient to climate change.
Farmers in sub-Saharan Africa need to diversify away from growing maize and switch to crops that are resilient to climate change to increase nutrition security.
Instead of maize, farmers should begin to grow fruits, vegetables, and crops like cassava, millet, and sorghum to provide the micronutrients essential for good health.
The researchers argue that the quantity of food produced must also increase, and more land must be brought into agricultural production.
More than 50 researchers contributed to the investigation, published in the scientific journal Nature Food. The study involved talking to policymakers and other stakeholders in the food and agriculture sectors in four countries in sub-Saharan Africa: Malawi, South Africa, Tanzania, and Zambia.
Sub-Saharan Africa is at risk of food and nutrition insecurity
According to the World Bank, sub-Saharan Africa is home to 1.2 billion people. It is expected that this will rise by 740 million people by 2050.
Farmers will have to increase the amount of food grown at a time when climate change will create extreme conditions – affecting what crops can be grown.
The team believe that the population is at risk of food and nutrition insecurity unless effective ways of adapting to climate change are identified.
Professor Jennie Macdiarmid, from the Rowett Institute at the University of Aberdeen and one of the authors of the paper, said: “The study has highlighted the need to place nutrition at the heart of agricultural policy to avoid the long-term unintended consequence of failing to produce food that can deliver the nutritional needs of the population.
“If policy solutions focus only on increasing production of calories and adapting to be climate smart, it is likely there will be negative consequences for health through nutritionally poor diets.”
Creating a resilient agricultural system
Using the iFEED assessment framework, the researchers investigated policy options to create an agricultural system that is resilient to climate change and combats nutrition insecurity.
“Too often food, agriculture and nutrition policies sit in siloes across different government departments,” said Dr Jennings, a Research Fellow in the School of Earth and Environment at the University of Leeds.
“This study provides holistic evidence that combines information on the environmental impacts of food system changes and the changes needed for population-level nutrition security.
“The research shows that action can be taken to adapt to climate change and improve nutrition security in sub-Saharan Africa.”
A transformative approach is needed to incorporate nutritional needs
Stakeholders in each country found key uncertainties in the future of the food system. iFEED considers these uncertainties and identifies agricultural policies to be contemplated.
To combat nutrition insecurity, scientists argue that there needs to be a fundamental shift in agriculture.
One option is to diversify into soybean production. This is because soybean crops are more likely to withstand the impacts of climate change compared to maize.
Dr Ndashe Kapulu said: “Many countries in sub-Saharan Africa will be better able to handle climate change and other stresses if they have more diverse food systems, such as the transition to soybean production in Zambia.
“As scientists, we need to generate enough evidence in our research to help make changes that support and guide actions to make the agrifood system more resilient.”
Increasing the production of animal-based products
In sub-Saharan Africa, increasing the production and consumption of animal-based products could fight nutrition insecurity. However, the researchers argue that it should not reach the unsustainable production levels seen in higher-income countries.
An increase in animal-based products would cause a rise in greenhouse gas emissions, but this could be tolerable to reduce sub-Saharan Africa’s need to reduce the risk of nutritionally inadequate diets.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/©-shutterstockCreative-Nerd_1379661350-1024x576.jpg,2024-01-02 11:42:55
https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/uk-government-fails-to-deploy-motorway-ultra-rapid-ev-chargers/41398/,UK Government fails to deploy motorway ultra-rapid EV chargers,"Research conducted by the RAC indicates that the UK Government has fallen short of its ambitious goal of deploying rapid or ultra-rapid EV chargers across motorway services in 2023.
The target was to have six or more rapid or ultra-rapid EV chargers available at every motorway service point, yet the reality paints a different picture.
Out of the 119 motorway service areas scrutinised by the RAC using Zapmap, merely 46, accounting for 39%, have achieved the intended number of chargers exceeding 50kW – a crucial capacity to cater to the burgeoning fleet of battery-electric vehicles.
Moreover, the number of rapid or ultra-rapid EV chargers has grown from just 27 (23%) from the end of April.
The goal was imperative considering the expectation that the UK’s electric vehicle count would surpass the one million mark by the end of 2023.
UK’s roadmap for EV charging
The government’s ‘Taking Charge: the Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Strategy’ aimed to expedite high-powered charger deployment via the £950m Rapid Charging Fund.
However, delays ensued, with the announcement of a £70m grant for a pilot scheme at ten motorway service stations only in early December 2023.
While the government foresees approximately 300,000 public chargers and over 6,000 high-powered chargers along strategic roads by 2035, forecasts from the Competition and Markets Authority suggest a larger requirement of 280,000-480,000 public charge points by 2030.
Areas for improvement in UK motorway services
Although there has been a notable increase in high-powered chargers, with an additional 178 installed since spring, the progress remains insufficient. Encouragingly, more than half of the services (55%) now offer ultra-rapid EV chargers, accelerating the process for drivers.
However, concerning gaps persist. Shockingly, four service areas—Leicester Forest on both sides of the M1, Tebay South on the M6, and Barton Park on the A1(M)—lack any charging facilities. Furthermore, only 18 service areas lack rapid EV charging above 50kW.
Comparative figures between the RAC research and Zapmap’s charging statistics reveal that a mere 6% of all high-powered chargers are available at motorway services, underlining the pressing need for accelerated infrastructure development.
Simon Williams, an RAC EV spokesperson, commented: “It’s clear from our research that the government has fallen well short of its target of having six high-powered chargers at every motorway service area in England.
“While that’s the case, some very good progress has been made since the end of April when we last carried out our survey, with four-in-ten services (39%) now having met or exceeded the target number of chargers, compared to just under a quarter (23%) eight months ago.
“There is undoubtedly an eagerness among charge point companies and motorway service operators to install these types of units but unfortunately, it’s often the high-power cabling to the grid that’s the major barrier which is out of their hands.
“More clearly needs to be done to make this process simpler than it is currently. Hopefully, once the government’s Rapid Charging Fund kicks fully into action some of these hurdles will be overcome.
“We continue to believe that the wide availability of ultra-rapid charging is crucial in giving both current and future EV drivers confidence to know they can easily make journeys beyond the range of their vehicles in a time-efficient way.”
Increasing charging compatibility
The analysis also sheds light on connector types, showcasing a 48% increase in Combined Charging System (CCS) connectors and a 32% rise in CHAdeMO connectors, addressing compatibility concerns for different electric car models.
The shortfall in meeting charging infrastructure targets signals the necessity for expedited action to support the burgeoning EV landscape and provide drivers with the confidence to undertake longer journeys without concerns about charging accessibility.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/©-shutterstockAmani-A_1488128222.jpg,2024-01-02 10:48:00
https://venturebeat.com/ai/why-nyt-vs-openai-will-be-the-copyright-fight-to-watch-in-2024-the-ai-beat/,Why NYT vs. OpenAI will be the copyright fight to watch in 2024 | The AI Beat,"Join leaders in San Francisco on January 10 for an exclusive night of networking, insights, and conversation. Request an invite here.
No matter which side you think will win the battle, there is no doubt that the New York Times’ new lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement, filed last Wednesday, will be one of the most important copyright fights to watch in 2024.
The Gray Lady vs. the Generative AI Bros? Pass the popcorn, please. The lawsuit maintains the defendants should be held responsible for “billions of dollars in statutory and actual damages” related to the “unlawful copying and use of The Times’s uniquely valuable works.” It also calls for OpenAI and Microsoft to destroy any chatbot models and training data that use New York Times copyrighted material.
Here’s why this case is so munch-worthy in what may be a make-or-break year for AI and copyright: For one thing, legal experts have long predicted that a case around AI and copyright could make it to the Supreme Court — and a high profile case like the New York Times vs. Microsoft and OpenAI could be just the ticket to a date with the nine justices.
Generative AI copyright battles have been brewing for over a year
Back in August 2022, before ChatGPT was released, I spoke to Bradford Newman, a partner at law firm Baker McKenzie in its Palo Alto office, about the legal battles brewing around generative AI.

“Legally, right now, there is little guidance,” he warned. “There are the inevitable class actions, but the net net of it all is when you’re using the massive data sets that these AI applications are and you sprinkle on top of that open source licenses…the arguments are going to be fair use versus infringement.”
Different courts, he predicted, will come to different conclusions. “Ultimately, I believe this is going to go to the Supreme Court.”
In addition, industries affected by generative AI are not taking a wait-and-see attitude when it comes to copyright issues, particularly in areas such as publishing and entertainment. Marc Rotenberg, president and founder of the nonprofit Center for AI and Digital Policy, as well as an adjunct professor at Georgetown Law School, spoke to me in September for a deep-dive article into copyright issues around AI training data. He was waiting, he said, for the New York Times to make a legal move against OpenAI.
The New York Times-OpenAI matchup has arrived
He pointed to the famous Authors Guild v. Google, a federal copyright case that centered on whether Google Books’ effort to digitize books constituted “fair use,” and wound its way through the courts for a decade before being decided in Google’s favor in 2015.
“Google did very well there in the outcome as a legal matter, but the publishers and the news industry did not, and there was a real consequence that the publishing industry and journalism is in trouble,” Rotenberg told me. “It’s the reason that the New York Times, which survived the first battle, even as many regional and local news organizations collapsed, is suddenly aware that they may be in trouble too.”
The big takeaway, he continued, is that if AI models, which need high-quality data, could also replicate what the New York Times offers, the news giant could go out of business. “So to me, it’s one of the most interesting legal cases today involving AI…the looming battle between one of the most well regarded publishers, The New York Times, and one of the most impactful generative AI firms OpenAI.”
OpenAI lawyers are ready to play defense
There is no reason to doubt that OpenAI and Microsoft are fully-prepared to play strong defense in this case. Back in July, I spoke to a prominent attorney specializing in copyright law who is helping to defend OpenAI in at least one of the cases filed in 2023 by authors accusing the company of infringing their copyrights. He told me that the cases focused on generative AI and copyright will play a huge role in “shaping the pace and contours of innovation” as well as the understanding the role of copyright law.
“I think every 20 years or so, there’s a new, really significant question that comes along and forms how the commercial world works,” he said. “We had a case in the early 1980s that went to the Supreme Court over the VCR. We had a whole wave of cases over Web 2.0 to figure out how this new law called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act works, or user generated content. I think what we’re seeing right now is the next big wave of litigation over these tools that are going to, if you ask me, have a profound effect on society.”
At the time, he told me was “quite confident” that the position of the technology companies on copyright “is the one that should and hopefully will prevail,” adding that copyright is often invoked to solve problems it was not meant to solve.
“It’s just really bad for using the regulated labor market, or privacy considerations, or whatever it is — there are other bodies of law that deal with this concern,” he said. “[Copyright is] just not the right instrument for that. And I think happily, courts have been sort of generally pretty faithful to that concept.”
But either way, he emphasized, changing copyright law for the sake of protecting any industry is a “really terrible decision” that will never work because the laws will not apply outside the US. “These tools are going to continue to exist,” he said, and there will be a tremendous amount of jurisdictional arbitrage in terms of where these companies are based, in terms of the location from which the tools are launched.”
Simply put, he said: “You couldn’t put this cat back in the bag.”",https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Untitled-design-2024-01-02T105616.348.png?w=1200&strip=all,2024-01-02 17:29:48
