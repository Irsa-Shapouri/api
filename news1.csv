Can't we all just get along?
Better yet, couldn't EA make things less prickly between MUT players and franchise mode folks?
Madden players are divided into three main categories.
There are some sub-categories within these profiles, but they're mostly hardcore Ultimate Team players, online head-to-head players, and diehard franchise mode users.
You'll probably never convert strictly MUT players to franchise mode, and it's an equally challenging flip vice versa. That said, some elements within the game cross over–besides the core gameplay.
The most significant piece and point of contention is the inclusion of legends.
EA has a pretty healthy and attractive list of legends incorporated in MUT, but unfortunately, none of those legends are available for offline use or in rosters for franchise mode players.
Roster makers often make historic rosters with their versions of legends like Deion Sanders, Joe Montana, Randy Moss, and Michael Vick (the most recent legend dangled in front of users on the main menu only to be kept exclusively in MUT).
Still, those user creations aren't quite as cool as the ones that are scanned or expertly crafted by EA's art team.
How close can roster makers come to creating realistic-looking versions of these legends?
Based on the limited number of template faces available and with no way to sculpt a created player's face, you're limited to simply trying to find a guy with the right skin complexion.
Why would EA not follow 2K and Sony San Diego Studio's lead and allow every legend that appears in their respective collector modes to be available for offline use?
In NBA 2K, every legend in MyTeam is on an All-Time or classic team roster. In MLB The Show, each legend in Diamond Dynasty is on one of the fictional legends' teams or in the free agent pool.
Perhaps even more inexplicable, EA’s NHL franchise has the legends from HUT available in their base game.
Madden is the only major American sports video game franchise that locks its legends in its collector mode. The only logical reason for this exclusivity is rooted in a philosophy that suggests making the legends available in the base game would devalue them in MUT.
Essentially, EA seems to believe that keeping Vick and other legends exclusive to MUT will entice players into playing the collector mode–even if they would rather play franchise.
I hope this isn't the thought process, as tying a consumer's hands has never been my favorite approach. It's also a significant overreaction.
I've played thousands of hours of collector modes in sports games, and the most influential concept in these modes is power.
Users want the most powerful cards; by powerful, I mean the ones that give them the best chance to win online games against other users.
Whether they are legends or not, those cards are the most significant factor in grinding, pack purchases, and microtransaction spending.
Keeping legends away from the base game isn't positively impacting the bottom line. MUT users who crave power will still go hard for a good Vick card, even if he's available to offline franchise mode users.
If there is some gating, it would make more sense for offline users to be able to unlock legends within MUT for use in the base game. Ideally, users could have the option to unlock the legends through gameplay or via purchase.
With this system, wouldn't everyone get what they want? Wouldn't EA still monetize the legends they've paid to sign?
Wouldn't MUT users still have the greatest players in NFL history available as rewards? And wouldn't franchise users have an extra piece to add to their virtual football experience?
It makes too much sense not to be a thing at some point.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6594ff08667811318aadf052/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1863,1048,x0,y110,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-01-03 01:38:30

The highly anticipated event will occur at the SAP Centre in San Jose, CA, at 10 am Pacific on January 17th. And we have a hint on the South Korean company’s focus.
Samsung Galaxy Unpacked invitation (early 2024). Samsung Pressroom
Curiously, the focus of the teaser is not on the widely expected Galaxy S24, S24+ or S24 Ultra smartphones, although Samsung has confirmed that the Galaxy S Series will be part of the event. Instead, the focus is on Galaxy AI. Samsung has previously announced Samsung Gauss, an AI platform with three key modules; ""Gauss Language for understanding human language and crafting natural responses, Gauss Code assists software development for code descriptions and creating test cases, and Gauss Image allows the creation of and the modification of images.""
No doubt, Gauss will be one of the tools that will help deliver on the promise that “Galaxy AI is coming.""
The Galaxy S handsets are a key part of the proposition, with the press release noting that “[Samsung will] unveil the latest premium Galaxy innovations, providing an all-new mobile experience powered by AI. ""
The new handsets will be powered by Samsung's latest Exynos 2400 chipset or a tweaked Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 tailored for the Galaxy S24 platform, depending on the territory. The Samsung community will be looking to see if the Exynos handsets can finally match the performance and efficiency of the Qualcomm-powered option. Both chipsets are tailored towards optimizing AI and ML routines running solely on a device or working alongside cloud-based services.
The Galaxy S24 Ultra is also expected to launch with a new S-Pen stylus and feature a titanium chassis to increase durability while reducing the overall weight of the flagship.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevemcdowell/2024/01/02/halcyons-latest-funding-shows-robust-cybersecurity-growth/,Halcyon’s Latest Funding Shows Robust Cybersecurity Growth,"Ransomware NAND Research
Halcyon, an emerging player in the cybersecurity anti-ransomware sector, recently marked a significant milestone in its growth trajectory, securing an additional $40 million in a Series B funding round. This recent infusion of capital brings the company's total funding to an impressive $84 million, following a $44 million Series A round last April.
I spoke with Jon Miller, the company’s co-founder and CEO, shortly after news of Halcyon’s funding round became public. He took me behind the scenes, describing how Halcyon differentiates in a hyper-competitive and growing market.
Halcyon’s Unique Approach to Ransomware Protection
Halcyon has carved a niche in anti-ransomware solutions and services with offerings tailored to combat the increasing threat of ransomware attacks, which have become a significant concern for businesses and institutions worldwide.
While the company offers a suite of tools that provide a comprehensive defense mechanism against ransomware threats, it takes a high-touch bespoke approach to helping its customers navigate the threat landscape.
As Mr. Miller told me, Halcyon brings a “unique set of services” to the anti-ransomware market. The company’s services team consults with enterprises to ensure that those customers are prepared to protect themselves, but also be able to quickly recover from has become an almost certain attack.
Halcyon is famous for its ability to help customers quickly recover from an attack, usually within twenty-four hours. The secret to such a rapid recovery lay in Halcyon’s proprietary “recovery engine,” which allows for data recovery even without the ransomware’s encryption key.
Halcyon delivers tools that provide anti-tamper protections, aimed at preventing unauthorized access and alterations to data; anti-data exfiltration software, which helps safeguard sensitive information from being stolen or leaked; and key material capture capabilities, a unique feature that aids in securing critical data encryption keys.
Halcyon's integration of advanced AI models into its security infrastructure is another key differentiator for the company. Halcyon’s models are trained to detect, disrupt, and counter ransomware attacks, offering a proactive and dynamic line of defense. This AI-driven approach allows Halcyon's solutions to continually adapt to new and evolving cyber threats, ensuring that its protection remains effective against the latest ransomware tactics.
Moreover, Halcyon's platform is designed to be autonomous and able to update its detection and prevention algorithms in real time. This aspect is crucial in the fast-paced digital environment where cyber threats evolve rapidly, and traditional, manual update processes often need to be faster to be effective.
The company's focus on ransomware, a particularly pernicious and growing cyberattack, demonstrates a deep understanding of the current cybersecurity landscape and its specific challenges.
Analyst’s Take
Halcyon's emergence in the cybersecurity landscape represents a significant development in the battle against ransomware, a growing threat in our increasingly digital world. The company stands out for its specialized focus on anti-ransomware solutions, allowing Halcyon to develop advanced tools that prevent attacks and offer unique capabilities like device decryption post-attack.
Financially, Halcyon's fundraising achievements, including its recent $40 million Series B funding round, signal strong market confidence in its approach and potential. This funding, totaling $84 million to date, speaks to investors' belief in Halcyon's innovative strategies and ability to fill a crucial gap in the cybersecurity market.
Moreover, the company's growing client base, which includes over 100 enterprise-level brands and several state-level school districts, reflects the effectiveness of its solutions and the broad applicability of its products across various sectors. Its client diversity underscores the universal challenge of ransomware and positions Halcyon as a versatile and critical player in this domain.
The company operates in a crowded market, filled with well-funded and capable competitors such as CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, and Microsoft; this is market where its often difficult to demonstrate differentiation. The challenge for Halcyon will be in maintaining its specialized focus, including its unique services offerings, while adapting to the constantly changing nature of cyber threats and the evolving needs of its clients.
Halcyon’s approach, and continued success, reveal a company that’s navigating a complex and competitive market with a nice balance of focus and execution. In the face of an ever-increasing and sophisticated threat landscape, Halcyon's uniquely focused approach to ransomware and its technological advancements and strategic expansion marks it as a company to watch in the cybersecurity arena.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnarcher/2024/01/02/lg-reveals-2024-oled-tv-range/,LG Reveals 2024 OLED TV Range,"There are few if any AV-related announcements each year more eagerly anticipated than LG’s annual revelation of its new OLED TV range. So I’m pleased to say that day has come early this year, ahead of the start of the 2024 CES in Las Vegas next week. And while LG’s new OLED range perhaps looks set to be more of an iterative improvement over 2023 rather than the revolutionary leap we got with last year’s G3 series, there’s still lots of exciting-sounding stuff for serious AV fans to look forward to.
Given the leap forward for WRGB technology last year’s LG G3 models gave us with their use of of Micro Lens Array technology (as part of what LG calls its Brightness Booster Max technology, to reflect the fact that the MLA hardware is just a part of what makes LG’s premium OLED picture quality tick), let’s look first at LG’s new G4 range.
LG's new G4 series will build on the Brightness Booster Max technology introduced on last year's G3 ... [+] range with an ultra-powerful new processor. There's a new matching soundbar for the G4s, too. Photo: LG
The main picture improvement here is set to come from a new processor that LG claims is so big a leap over its predecessor that they’ve named it Alpha 11 AI instead of the Alpha 10 engine we’d expected to follow from 2023’s Alpha 9 processor. If you want some numbers to go with the Alpha 11 AI hype, LG claims the new chip will offer four times the AI performance of its predecessor, 1.7x the graphics performance, and 1.3x the general processing power - all partnered with 2.5GB of RAM.
The biggest single bit of news regarding Alpha 11 is that LG’s AI Picture Pro deep learning-powered image enhancement system can now work across all sources, including those connected to the TV via HDMI, rather than only working with broadcasts and some streaming services as it did before.
The new AI Picture Pro system carries the latest versions of the genre and scene analysis, AI Super Resolution, Noise Reduction and OLED Dynamic Tone Mapping Pro engine features (the latter of which breaks the image into thousands of analysis blocks to make its tone mapping more effective) we’ve seen in AI Picture Pro before. But Alpha 11 also introduces two potentially key new AI Picture Pro features: Object Enhancing By Visual Perception, and AI Director Processing.
The Object Enhancing By Visual Perception feature is claimed to analyze each and every pixel in the picture to better detect and more effective treat different objects in an image to help make it in more life-like (so key objects gain more emphasis, for instance). The AI Director Processing attempts to apply to whatever you’re watching the colour theory (where colour is used to enhance emotions) used during content mastering and grading to give images more power.
These two new features might sound problematic for AV purists who would rather their TV just show as accurately as possible the images it’s receiving. However, given the power and extent of the AI deep learning that’s behind these features, I suspect they’re probably going to be worth at least experimenting with, even for die-hard cinephiles.
The Alpha 11 processor introduces a couple of potentially critical new elements to the G4’s AI Sound Pro system, too: A virtual 11.1.2-channel upmixer that can even be applied to stereo sources, and a new Voice Remastering system that’s able to use AI to extract voices from audio mixes so that their clarity can be enhanced without affecting the rest of the mix. These new features join previous AI Sound Pro features of Adaptive Sound Control (which optimizes sound playback in real time based on analysis of the content), AI Acoustic Tuning to optimise the sound for your room set up, and a Dynamic Sound Booster for making the sound more dynamic and powerful.
LG's flagship OLED range for 2024 will be the wireless M4s. Photo: LG
While it’s not clear if LG has implemented any significant improvements to the hardware side of the Micro Lens Array system that helped the G3s deliver such a game-changing increase in brightness last year, LG does state that its latest Brightness Booster Max technology, which also incorporates a light boosting algorithm along with the better ‘light control architecture’, will make the G4s even brighter than the G3s. It’s not absolutely clear by how much; LG just states that the G4s will be up to 70% brighter than ‘conventional’ (which is to say, basic entry level models such as LG’sB series) OLED screens.
One other great bit of progress for the G4 range finds the Brightness Booster Max system extending to the 83-inch model; it’s no longer restricted to the 55, 65 and 77-inch sizes in the range. The only G4 model that won’t benefit from Brightness Booster Max technology is the new king-sized 97 incher.
Gamers have a new feature to look forward to, meanwhile, in the shape of support for 144Hz games if you have a PC capable of delivering such refresh rates. LG claims that this feature makes its new ‘Evo’ OLED models (which include new C4 and M4 models as well as the G4s) the first TVs to officially support both Nvidia G-Sync and 144Hz. They also support AMD FreeSync, of course.
The M4 models mentioned back there will actually represent LG’s flagship OLED TVs for 2024. As anyone familiar with the M3 TVs LG introduced relatively late on in 2023 might expect, the new M4 range will continue to be built around LG’s Zero Connect system, where an external connection box sends pictures up to 4K/144Hz HDR (making them the first TVs to do this without compression) wirelessly to their gorgeously minimalistic partner OLED screens. The M4s will improve on their M3 predecessors by sporting the latest Alpha 11 AI processor, and again all screen sizes bar the 97-inch one will benefit from Brightness Booster Max technology.
The M4 and G4 screens will both feature so-called ‘One Wall Designs’ ideally suited to wall mounting, and five-year warranties as a sign of LG’s confidence in their longevity.
One other new feature exclusive to LG’s M4 and G4 OLED screens will be a new 4-screen multi-view system unlocked by the power of the Alpha 11 processor. This lets you divide the screen into four smaller screens showing different sources, with the power of the new processor increasing the range of source combinations you can set up (including live TV, HDMI, YouTube, CAM, Browser, Miracast, Spotify and Airplay) and improving the interface you use for selecting your Multiview sources.
The new C4 range
Rounding out LG’s so-called evo range of premium OLED panels will be the C4 range. As with the C series in 2023’s LG OLED range, the C4s won’t benefit from the full Brightness Booster Max technology, with some C4 screen sizes instead falling back to regular Brightness Booster technology. This reflects a specific combination of a slightly improved version of the Alpha 9 processor deployed on last year’s C3 models, and LG ‘evo’ panels that deliver more brightness than the basic OLED panels used in LG’s entry-level OLED range without getting the extra brightness boost made possible by MLA technology. Again, LG suggests there should be a small brightness enhancement for the C4s over the C3s, but can’t provide any exact figures for this.
As with previous years, the 42 and 48-inch C4s won’t get the Brightness Booster technology - though LG does confirm that they will definitely be brighter than their 2023 counterparts.
The C4s lose the 5 year warranty of the G4 and M4 series, drop the multiview support to two screens from four, and switch away from a One Wall design to an Ultra Slim Design. They do, though, retain both the 144Hz gaming and far-field voice control (where you can talk to the TV without needing to press a button on your remote handset) features delivered by the M4s and G4s.
The LG C4 range in 2024 will be available in 42, 48, 55, 65, 77 and 83-inch screen sizes.
Wrapping up LG’s OLED offering for 2024 will be the entry-level B4 series. Available in 77, 65, 55 and 48-inch screen sizes, these models top out at 120Hz support rather than 144Hz, and step down to a new Alpha 8 AI 4K processor, which LG rather vaguely describes as ‘inherited’ from last year’s Alpha 9 AI 4K system.
There’s no far-field voice recognition on the B4s either, and they lose all of the Brightness Booster technologies available from the C4 up, meaning they’ll be significantly less bright than their siblings. They do, though, still get the Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos support enjoyed by all of LG’s more premium 2024 models, as well as the latest much-improved webOS platform including the two-screen Multiview system carried by the C4s.
LG has yet to provide launch date or pricing information for its 2024 OLED range, but rest assured I’ll bring you this information on my Forbes channel as soon as LG reveals it.

When Samsung launches the three new Galaxy S24 smartphones later this month, there will be exciting free offers for those who pre-order one of its flagship phones.
Galaxy S23, Galaxy Watch 5, and Galaxy Buds (Photo by Joan Cros/NurPhoto via Getty Images) NurPhoto via Getty Images
Samsung is widely expected to host a Galaxy Unpacked event on January 17th, where the Galaxy S24, Galaxy S24+ and Galaxy S24 Ultra will be launched. The handsets should go on general sale in key territories before the end of the month, but there will be a pre-order window with several free offers to encourage sales.
Update: Tuesday, January 2. Samsung has now announced the next Galaxy Unpacked event, where it will launch the Galaxy S24, S24+ and S24 Ultra. As well as confirming the time of 10 am Pacific on January 17th at the SAP Center in San Jose, CA, Samsung announced a special offer for those reserving a handset ahead of the launch… a pre-order on a pre-order, if you will.
Echoing a similar offer from the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Z Flip 5 launch, customers who reserve a handset between the 2nd and 16th of January will receive a $50 credit towards purchasing a handset from the S24 range.
There are no details on the pre-order offers yet; these will probably become clear during the launch event, but recent reports suggest two options will return to entice consumers to the new Galaxy flagships.

The first is “double your storage,” which will allow consumers to step up to the next model’s storage at no extra cost—if you buy the 128 GB model of the Galaxy S24 you’ll receive the 256 GB model right through the range to those buying the 512 GB model of the Galaxy S24 Ultra receiving the 1TB model. You can view it as a double your memory or a discount on the models with more storage; either way, it's an enticing option for those on a budget.
Then you have the bonus accessories. Samsung is expected to offer every Galaxy S24 buyer a discount on the Galaxy Buds Fan Edition wireless buds and Galaxy Watch smartwatches. The latest Buds FE were launched late last year alongside the Galaxy S23 FE smartphone, offering active noise cancellation and a transparency mode for $99. The Galaxy Watch 6 was launched in the summer of 2023 with improved battery life, slimmer bezels, and WearOS 4 for $299.
It remains to be seen which peripherals will be offered with which phones and how much discount will be offered. For comparison, Google offered a free set of Pixel Buds Pro for those pre-ordering the Pixel 8 smartphone and a free Pixel Watch 2 for those pre-ordering the Pixel 8 Pro.
Finally, you have the exclusive models available only through Samsung’s website.
Samsung will have a wide range of colors across the S24 portfolio, but some will only be available through the website. Those looking for the highest specced Galaxy S24 Ultra must order through Samsung’s website if, as expected, the 1 TB storage option will only be available online.
Recent leaks on the potential European pricing suggest that the Galaxy S24 and S24+ will be marginally cheaper than equivalent S23 models. At the same time, the Galaxy S24 Ultra will be more expensive than last year’s Galaxy S23 Ultra.

The parts to repair your own smartphone are now available.
Google's Pixel 8 Pro Ewan Spence
Several official spare parts are available through the popular iFixit website, with landing pages for the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro parts set up. The ‘big ticket’ item many will look for first is the screen. The Pixel 8 screen and digitzer is available for $159, or $229 for the Pixel 8 Pro version. A new battery for either Pixel is $42. These can all be bought individually or as part of a fix kit, which includes the necessary tools to replace the part, including suction handles, pry tools, cleaning cloths, and 4mm bits.
Some parts are not available. The one most likely to cause an issue is the lack of a replacement USB-C port. This is part of the main circuit board, and the main board is not available for purchase.
While this may be a disappointment, it should not negate the positive benefits of offering official parts and repair guides. Pixel owners now have a supply of parts available for the same seven years as the software updates. Google is highlighting the benefits of an open repair program to the rest of the smartphone industry.
Now, we need everyone else to open up and let consumers have the right and the tools required to repair their own smartphones.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2024/01/02/dr-gpt-84-say-chatgpt-got-their-diagnosis-right/,Dr GPT: 84% Say ChatGPT Got Their Diagnosis Right,"Most Americans seem willing to trust AI with a bigger part of their medical needs. getty
Doctors and healthcare officials can debate the value of AI in health as much as they’d like. People are already voting with their fingers, and using ChatGPT for health care insights, diagnoses, and help with understanding what their doctors tell them. According to a new study of 2,000 American adults, 52% of us have given our symptoms to an AI system like ChatGPT. Of those, the vast majority say that ChatGPT got it right.
“Over half of the respondents (52%) stated they have given a list of their symptoms to a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT, looking for a diagnosis,” says the company that ran the survey, UserTesting. “Of them, 81% have been given a diagnosis from the LLM, and when asked for their diagnosis after consulting a doctor, 84% said the diagnosis was accurate.”
Americans appear especially likely to trust AI.
While almost half of English people and a third of Australians say they don’t trust AI for any health-related tasks, only 6% of Americans agree. While some of what we’d trust AI to do is simple tasks like scheduling appointments or coordinating with pharmacies, 53% of us “would trust AI to recommend treatment plans.”
I’ve personally used AI to decode medical jargon and understand a medical diagnosis after getting a full-body MRI. And I recently used ChatGPT to confirm that what I was feeling over the holidays was likely a flu.
It shouldn’t be a shock that Americans are looking for healthcare solutions outside of traditional doctor-patient and hospital arrangements. 26 million don’t have health insurance, and among those that do, expensive co-pays or difficulty getting an appointment make alternatives attractive. Plus, many rural and inner city areas in the United State may entirely lack local and convenient healthcare options regardless of your insurance status.
“The growing prevalence of healthcare deserts or even just ordinary lack of access in America means that AI will be incorporated into the healthcare journey to provide care at the scale that we need as the country ages,” says Lija Hogan, who leads research strategy at UserTesting.
What would we trust AI with?
Recommend treatment plans: 53% Monitoring sleeping patterns: 53% Scheduling doctors appointments: 52% Monitoring heart health: 51% Diagnosing chronic illnesses like heart disease: 48% Coordinating with pharmacies to fill prescriptions: 47% Monitoring blood pressure: 42% Diagnosing Covid: 42% Providing fertility information: 40% Diagnosing colds and flus: 40%
Of course, many of us have wearable devices and tools that do parts of this already: Apple Watches, Fitbits, or others. And 78% say that we believe AI and tech companies will protect the health data we share with them.
However, when we’re really sick, we probably need a doctor and specific medical tests for diseases that can only be detected with blood tests or other exams that consumer-grade wearable medical technology. Consumer tech may be coming for that too—see the COR ‘FitBit for your blood’ that I covered in March of 2022—but there are some things only doctors can do. Few of us have a personal MRI machine, or X-ray.
The best option may be doctors and AI working together: an ever-present frontline of health information delivered seamlessly via wearable tech and smart AI, and a secondary layer of defense provided by experts taking advantage of all the data and insights that smart systems can provide.
""Doctors and patients need to figure out together how AI can play the best role in healthcare journey,” says Hogan. “This means that we have to figure out the right guardrails to ensure people are getting high-quality advice in the right contexts and how to connect patients to providers.”
That connected, seamless system of medical professionals and healthcare-trained AIs, however, has yet to be delivered.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6594aa9fb0ae4932027051de/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-01-02 19:32:58

It’s the very first Wordle Wednesday of 2024! I hope everyone had a wonderful holiday break, a lovely Christmas and a very, very happy New Year’s! I have a good feeling about this year. 2023 was something of a bust for me, but if nothing else I think I ended it on a high note, and so I tread into the dawn of a new year with some hope for the future. Not too much, mind you, but some.
Rebellions are built on hope.
In any case, it’s Wednesday and that means it’s time to solve a riddle, brain teaser or logic puzzle. Here’s today’s:
A farmer sends his daughter on a small boat across the river to the market with a pouch of coins. With her pouch of coins she purchases a mangy dog, a chicken and a bag of corn. When she brings her purchases back to her small boat, she realizes that it is so small that she’ll only be able to carry one of her three purchases across at a time. She is faced with a dilemma, however: If she leaves the chicken with the corn, the chicken will eat the corn. If she leaves the mangy dog with the chicken, the mangy dog will eat the chicken. How does she get all three items across without any of them becoming a meal?
If you solve this puzzle, let me know on Twitter or Facebook. I’ll post the answer here on my blog (be sure to follow!) in tomorrow’s Wordle Guide.

Can you solve today’s phrase? Play Now
I got a bit of a kick out of how my own guesses went down today. I was thinking bout guilt because somebody sent me an angry message about my coverage of the Jonathan Majors case, and one of the only words left that I could think of after that was trial. How ironic! I obviously had to use that for my second guess—and oh how sweet it would have been if that had been today’s Wordle!—but came back with three greens and one yellow ‘R’.
At this point, the answer was obvious: twirl for the win. Huzzah!
Today’s Competitive Wordle Score
Once again, I get 1 point for guessing in three and 0 for tying the Bot. I’ll take it!
Today’s Wordle Etymology
The word ""twirl"" originates from the Middle English ""twirlen"" or ""twirlig"", which in turn comes from the Old English ""thwirl,"" meaning ""to turn around."" This Old English root is connected to the Old Norse ""þvarr,"" meaning ""stubborn,"" suggesting a sense of something being twisted or turned with force.
The evolution of ""twirl"" reflects a common pattern in English etymology where words evolve through gradual phonetic and semantic changes over time, often influenced by the languages of neighboring cultures and invading forces, like the Norse in the case of Old English. This word particularly encapsulates the action of turning or spinning something in a light, quick manner, which is consistent with its etymological roots in the idea of turning or twisting.

[+] Garlinghouse. X
Have you been seeing ads for an “airdrop” of the cryptocurrency XRP on platforms like YouTube and X over the past couple of months? They feature Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse explaining how people can receive XRP for free if they just send a particular crypto wallet some XRP first. But it’s all a scam using artificial intelligence to make it look like Garlinghouse is saying things he never actually said.
I first noticed the scam ads on YouTube back in November, which is unusual because the social media platform has a number of safeguards in place to protect against obvious scams. But recently I’ve been seeing the ad so much on X, formerly known as Twitter, that it’s seemingly taking up half of the ads in my feed.
The ads appear to use AI to make it look like Garlinghouse is saying things he didn’t say. And it’s somewhat convincing until you really look at his mouth and notice the lip movements don’t quite match what he’s saying.
Garlinghouse himself confirmed back in November that the ads are scams.
“There’s been an uptick in deepfake scam videos (ex below) overlaying new words with old video footage from Ripple’s events (@YouTube are you asleep at the wheel again?!). Reminder: don't trust, verify (all approved messaging will only come from official Ripple accounts),” Garlinghouse tweeted on November 16, 2023.
New technologies that allow anyone to sample someone’s voice and create a video that makes it look like they’re saying things they never said have accelerated in recent years. And plenty of people are getting scammed by the ads, as you can see from testimonials of people who said they lost money on X.
“I just got scammed 2k in xrp on an ad here on X. Saying they would double it back to me. I should have looked it up....” one user wrote on X.
X has struggled in the past with scam cryptocurrency ads, including some that even use photos of X owner Elon Musk. And it’s not clear when the company will take crypto scams seriously, since they’ve become such a big problem.
X did not immediately respond to questions emailed Tuesday about why scam ads for free Ripple seem to have skyrocketed recently. I’ll update this post if I hear back. But for now, just know that anyone who’s promising to send you cryptocurrency if you just send them some crypto first, is almost certainly operating a scam.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65949b5aea75550602c919da/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-01-02 18:29:52

Frontdesk, a startup that managed more than 1,000 furnished apartments across the United States, laid off its entire 200-person workforce Tuesday after attempts to raise more capital failed, TechCrunch exclusively learned from sources familiar with internal happenings at the company. The mass layoff comes just seven months after the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based startup acquired smaller rival Zencity.
The layoffs, which included full-time, part-time workers and contractors, occurred Tuesday afternoon during “a two-minute Google Meet call,” according to one employee who was among those attending the virtual meeting.
During that call, Frontdesk CEO Jesse DePinto told employees that Frontdesk would be filing for a state receivership, an alternative to bankruptcy, according to the sources.
The company has not responded to a request for comment. When calling the number on the company’s website, a recording says: “Currently, Frontdesk is unavailable. If you have a reservation, please seek alternative accommodations and expect to be contacted within the next two weeks.” TechCrunch will update the article if the company responds.
Frontdesk, which was founded in 2017, had raised about $26 million from investors such as JetBlue Ventures, Veritas Investments and Sand Hill Angels, according to Crunchbase.
Frontdesk went out for a bridge round, attempting to sell investors on a new plan of doing full building management, sources told TechCrunch. That tactic didn’t work out and the company couldn’t keep operating. Frontdesk was apparently still optimistic about its ability to raise more capital; the startup had posted on LinkedIn openings for several jobs, including a chief of staff role, just two months ago.
The startup’s business model, which is leasing apartments at market rental rates and furnishing them for short-term rentals in more than 30 markets, has struggled largely due to the upfront costs involved, associated capital expenditures and variables in demand and rates, one of the sources said. Others in the space have also had challenges, including Stay Alfred, Domio, Lyric, Zeus Living, The Guild and WanderJaunt.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GettyImages-1188673335.jpg?resize=1200,776",2024-01-03 01:00:56

https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/lego-fortnite-interview-saxs-persson/,Why Fortnite is getting into cozy gaming,"Why Fortnite is getting into cozy gaming With Lego Fortnite, Epic Games is building out a gaming multiverse with a little something for everyone
When it comes to figuring out a formula for a hit game that keeps players coming back year after year, Saxs Persson would know. Now at Epic Games overseeing the Fortnite ecosystem, Persson previously spent 12 years at Mojang building Minecraft into the stratospheric success it is today.
Persson hopped over to Epic in 2022 to work on the Fortnite maker’s roadmap, shepherding Lego Fortnite from a press release last year into a polished, ambitious standalone experience designed to draw new audiences to Fortnite’s free-to-play world.
We spoke with Persson about Epic’s grand plans for Lego Fortnite and its two other new games, Rocket Racing and Fortnite Festival. Knowing Fortnite’s penchant for maximalism and a steady drip feed of fresh content, the trio of games is only just getting started — but here’s a glimpse of where they’re going.
Questions and answers have been edited for brevity and clarity.
TechCrunch: With the three new games, and particularly Lego Fortnite, is the goal to broaden Fortnite’s appeal to new kinds of players?
Persson: Battle Royale has been extraordinarily popular. And from a Battle Royale perspective we understand our players quite well. We’ve done our very best for the last six years to always make a game that feels fresh, evolves, never stands still, constantly updates and sets us apart from the competition by not taking itself too seriously. That’s always been the goal of Battle Royale.
The next ring that developed from that was when we put out Fortnite Creative and subsequently when we launched UEFN [Unreal Editor for Fortnite] in March this year – that is very much realizing that Fortnite players want to play more games, not just Battle Royale. And the more content they have, and the better content they have and the more varied content they have, the happier they are.
So if your only goal is to say, if you came to Fortnite, we would like you to consider all these different options, and to stay as long as you want to because we hope you’re going to have fun.
Our creators have done a phenomenal job of broadening, already, who plays Fortnite. Battle Royale is really important – it’s like an anchor tenant, whatever you want to call it. But if you asked players like ‘what do you play in a week,’ I think the average island played in the week is about seven, seven different islands. And they’re varied in style, aesthetics, genre… We ask our creators what they would like to create. If they want to create it, we bet there’s going to be players that want to play it. That’s been the strategy up until this far.
…In order for us to make really good tools, we have to use them ourselves. And we know that in order for us to really extend deep tools and new genres, our best bet is that we need to make some first party content that really stretches what Unreal Engine can do. And then take those tools and turn them over to creators and say now you have these capabilities.
So with that in mind, the three games we announced, Lego Fortnite, Rocket Racing, and [Fortnite] Festival all have different goals of extending the toolset in a particular direction, but also attracting new players to say ‘oh I guess Fortnite is not just Battle Royale. Really, we just need to get them over the hump of installing 54 gigabytes… and once you’re there, there should be a lot for you to do.
A test of turns. If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere. pic.twitter.com/X2mgqfv9YL — Rocket Racing (@RocketRacing) December 4, 2023
What do those sets of tools look like and what can people build with them?
“[With] Lego Fortnite… we’ve worked a lot on [procedural generation], we’ve worked a lot on different styles – like adding the Lego styles so you can both play as Fortnite style and as a minifig, as Lego style. And down the line we fully expect creators are gonna have access to that too.
The procedural world is really fascinating. Again, like we’ve always operated on a very static play playing field, but Lego is pioneering a whole lot of procedural tools that hopefully we can extend to creators, and a much bigger island – like we’re 20 times bigger than a Battle Royale island. So it is a massive island that we’re still working to expand. That again should benefit creators.
Rocket Racing is adding credible racing mechanics to our creators and track design editors and that sort of thing. So the game is important because it comes from Rocket League, and it’s an excellent game. And we really believe in that game. The secondary effect is creators get great vehicle tools.
And finally [Fortnite] Festival. A ton of effort has gone into music generation tools and music editing tools and music making tools and gameplay with music. And a lot of those devices, as we call them, have already been extended to creators.
So that’s the goal. Music attracts a new audience. Racing attracts a new audience. Lego attracts a new audience. Even though we know it appeals to current Fortnite players, it’s certainly going to appeal to audiences that are not interested in Battle Royale.
Get the band back together, you haven’t played with them since last year 😜 pic.twitter.com/OoKh69wcI5 — Fortnite Festival (@FNFestival) January 1, 2024
What about expanding Fortnite to younger players, is that part of the objective here?
We had introduced separately from LEGO but in collaboration with Lego a new ratings paradigm in Fortnite, where every piece of content is rated. That streamlines really nicely with our parental controls.It feels like if you’re a parent when you let your kid come into Fortnite, you don’t have to just slam the door wide open… you can still have at a granular level control over what your kids play.
And you can see what. So yeah, like, Lego is an E10 game, so mechanically, that opens a new audience. But I think underneath that, again, is there’s a whole suite of new features, just to be able to rate islands on an individual level. And just to really focus on like, how do we make a great experience for all ages that is age appropriate and safe?
Lego Fortnite seems to smartly dip into some genres and gameplay loops that people already love in other games. Animal Crossing, Minecraft and Valheim all come to mind, but there are quite a few.
I think all games should be inspired by something. What do we all enjoy? We really enjoy Zelda, really enjoy Minecraft, really enjoy Animal Crossing, Stardew Valley. All four of them are absolutely, in and of themselves, excellent examples of games that just have just have stood the test of time. That really, really resonate emotionally with people and we would love to add to that genre and be part of that genre.
I don’t think we’re anything in particular. Like we have aspects of Animal Crossing and a social sim… as it turns out, there’s nothing as cute as building a building with minifigs that all have jobs, and they all want to be part of your village and can [help out] with the harvest and go on adventures with you. The social sim design is very much focused on realizing the Lego fantasy, but it does feel like it has the cozy gamer aspect of it for sure, of homesteading and building and village building and investing in your people.
In a procedurally generated survival game — when you play something like Valheim or Minecraft — you have a big moment when you first open the map. It’s exciting, and you don’t know what’s around you and how dangerous it is. Lego Fortnite has that same feeling.
I think a key part of what Fortnite is is ‘what’s around the next corner?’ When we started working on procedural, procedurally generating these landscapes, there was just a lot of just wandering and just making these amazing looking things and then adding like more and more and more into it and sort of doing a true crossover between Lego and Fortnite and trying to find like what is it that would satisfy Lego players and would satisfy Fortnite players – really feeling like we understand these two IPs. And the landscape is littered with that.
I think the internal model was that Fortnite is the canvas and Lego is the paint. Basically anything you touch becomes Lego as you play, and the more you play, the more Lego-ized you make the world. I really liked that idea of landing on a Fortnite planet mysteriously transformed into a Lego figure and then, like making that into a survival sandbox — a true sandbox where anything can happen.
I love that genre is I really think it speaks to all of us, like in a very simple way that you get to set your own stakes and really the job is to not die. But everything else like thriving is completely up to you.
People who don’t follow Fortnite and don’t know about its user-generated content probably still think it’s just a zany battle royale game where 100 people fight to the death. How do you get the word out that hey, Fortnite is an ecosystem filled with lots of different things, now including these three major games we developed?
There’s nothing like YouTube videos showing the shenanigans of Lego Fortnite or your favorite streamer spending time in it. Because we think it has enormous storytelling potential for YouTubers and for and for Twitch streamers. It’s a sandbox that is made for you to essentially tell stories.
It is very much what has made Minecraft very, very successful. It is what you make it, meaning the more creative you are the better your videos and we really, really feel like the streaming community and YouTube is gonna help us tell that story for us.
Now it’s on to updates. If there is one thing Epic knows and the Fortnite team knows it’s players want content, they want updates and that is very much what the team is focused on.
All of us agreed that the best chance we have of retelling the story of Fortnite is to go overboard with content. And really show like, when Epic puts his mind to it, we have done our groundwork and we believe that Fortnite is the place that you would want to be and to spend time in, no matter what age you are, no matter what you’re interested in. There should be content that will resonate with you.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/SHARE_20240103_0124041.jpeg?resize=1200,675",2024-01-03 01:44:57

https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/former-anthemis-partner-soft-launches-new-fintech-focused-venture-firm/,Former Anthemis partner soft-launches new fintech-focused venture firm,"Ruth Foxe Blader has left her role as partner at Anthemis Group after nearly seven years to start her own venture firm, Foxe Capital, TechCrunch learned exclusively today.
Blader is joined by former Anthemis investment associate Kyle Perez. Sophie Winwood is serving as an operating partner. Winwood previously co-founded WVC:E, an organization that pledges to promote “inclusion, empowerment and integration of VC globally,” with Blader.
Over the years, Blader says she has led investments in more than 50 fintech startups, including Lemonade, Branch, Elevate, Flock, Mesh and Amplify.
A desire to invest independently was the main driver behind Blader’s decision to leave London-based Anthemis, Blader told TechCrunch in an interview. The investor says she got a taste of what that was like after she and Winwood started WVC:E in April 2022.
Foxe Capital will continue investing on behalf of Anthemis, serving as a sub advisor for the firm, and essentially managing the vehicle she was hired to run in 2017. When all that capital has been deployed — Blader projects that it will stop writing checks into startups this year out of the Anthemis funds — Foxe Capital will focus on fundraising. Meanwhile, Foxe Capital is being compensated for continuing to run the fund on behalf of Anthemis, according to Blader.
Anthemis continues to have an economic interest in that vehicle but does not own any part of the management company and will only have a continued economic interest in Foxe Capital if it chooses to be an LP when the firm fundraises in the future, according to Blader.
An Anthemis spokesperson confirmed the move, sharing via email: “Ruth wanted to be an independent manager. Anthemis proudly backs her. She will continue to support us as an investor across her current Anthemis funds.”
While Blader travels back and forth currently between France and New York (Blader has been living in Europe/New York for 15 years), Foxe Capital is based in New York City. Its investments will be global, with the U.S. as its home market.
“We have the most familiarity [outside of the U.S.] with Europe but have also done investments in India, Cameroon and LatAm,” she told TechCrunch. “We’ll be looking to invest opportunistically globally.”
Restructuring and a failed SPAC
Anthemis has had its share of upheaval — and turnover — in recent times.
Last April, TechCrunch broke the news that Anthemis Group had completed a restructuring that resulted in its letting go of 16 employees, or about 28% of its staff.
A spokesperson for London-based Anthemis at the time said the move was an effort “to better reflect current market conditions and to set up the business for future growth” against its “strategic priorities.”
Also, last May, TechCrunch reported that Anthemis Group was trying to raise $200 million for a third fund. It had been in the market since 2022 and had only secured commitments of just $36.4 million. The firm separately had to scrap plans to raise a SPAC in late April.
In the past 18 months, Anthemis also saw a couple of portfolio companies stumble. In November 2022, controversy surrounding the sudden stepping down of three of Pipe’s co-founders, including its CEO, raised eyebrows. And in 2023, LGBTQ+-focused digital bank Daylight was slammed with a lawsuit by three former employees “alleging age and wage discrimination, whistleblower retaliation, and fraud.” The startup shut down later in the year.
The firm’s 2023 restructuring was not the first time it saw a management shakeup. Anthemis also made headlines in 2018 when its then-CEO and co-founder Nadeem Shaikh resigned after reportedly being the target of a sexual harassment complaint by a female employee.
Blader is not the first fintech-focused investor to venture out on her own in recent times.
Early last year, Peter Ackerson departed fintech-focused Fin Capital to co-found a new firm, Audere Capital. It is still unclear as to whether Ackerson left voluntarily or was forced to leave. A source with familiarity of internal happenings at Fin Capital alleged there was tension between Ackerson and managing partner and founder Logan Allin around portfolio company alternative financing startup Pipe — an investment into which Ackerson led and on whose board he sat. Audere has invested in five startups, according to PitchBook — only one of which is focused on financial services.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/samsungs-galaxy-s24-line-set-for-january-17-debut/,Samsung’s Galaxy S24 lineup set for January 17 debut,"Samsung’s mobile division ditched the big show unveils a while back. Gone, too, it seems, are the days when the company would save its first big phone news of the year for the weeks leading up to Mobile World Congress.
The latest Unpacked event is set for January 17 — a week and change after the close of CES. If past is precedent (as it almost invariably is), we’ll be getting our first official look at Samsung’s new mobile flagship, the Galaxy S24.
Last year’s event, held at the beginning of February, ushered in three key versions of the S23, along with a handful of Galaxy Book laptops. This being Samsung, the handset leaks have been ongoing for a couple of months now.
Renders of the S24, S24+ and the S24 Ultra don’t stray too far from their predecessors. Those devices are expected to sport 6.2-, 6.7- and 6.8-inch displays, respectively. The S24 and S24+ look to be sporting a trio of rear-facing cameras, while the Ultra bumps it up to a quartet, including the 200-megapixel sensor.
The Ultra also maintains much of the DNA the device inherited from the Galaxy Note line, including square edges and S Pen functionality. The ultra-premium model is also believed to be getting a titanium option, much like the iPhone 15 Pro Max before it.
In spite of apparently being among the first to be powered by Qualcomm’s more powerful and power-efficient Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip, leaked price sheets point at a lower price point in Europe, which could be good news for potential buyers everywhere.
This time out, the event is being held in the South Bay. It kicks off at 10 a.m. PT and will be available to stream here. If you want to reserve the device sight unseen up to January 16, Samsung will toss in a $50 “reserve credit” on preorders.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/CMC_6058.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-01-02 23:00:02
https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/tech-for-palestine-launches-to-provide-tools-and-projects-to-help-advocate-for-palestinians/,Tech for Palestine launches to provide tools to help support Palestinians,"More than 40 founders, investors, engineers and others in the tech industry are today announcing a coalition called Tech for Palestine to build open source projects, tools and data to help others in the industry advocate for the Palestinian people.
The launch of the group comes during a tense time in the region. Hamas’s October 7th attack on Israel led to the deaths of more than 1,100 individuals. The war in the Gaza Strip that followed has seen the displacement of millions of Palestinians and tens of thousands of deaths.
The Israel-Hamas war has proved divisive to the tech industry. Israel, home to a well-known technology and startup market, has seen strong support from tech individuals and institutions. In contrast, calls for ceasefires and speaking in support of Palestine have caused some to lose their jobs.
Paul Biggar, the founder of Tech for Palestine, hopes to raise more awareness of the war in Gaza, fight for a permanent ceasefire and provide ways for those who are afraid to speak publicly in support of Palestine to still offer support. It is one of the first tech initiatives to take a public stance supporting Palestine and could represent a turning point in the venture industry’s posture regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict as more people seek to speak out in favor of a ceasefire.
Biggar, the founder of the company CircleCI — last valued at $1.7 billion — formed the coalition after writing a viral blog post that criticized the lack of support the tech industry has shown Palestinians. He said that after he wrote his blog post, thousands of people reached out to him with words of support, many of them afraid to speak up themselves for fear of potential career impacts.
Among them, he said, were “dozens of people not only speaking up but who had started projects to change the industry to ensure that people speaking up for Palestine could be heard. Dozens of others were volunteering to help,” Biggar added. “I started connecting these folks together, and the [Tech for Palestine] community came together very quickly.”
The platform, still in its early days, will feature projects run by small groups and serve as a place to share resources and advice, something many pro-Palestinian tech workers are already doing privately. It has already secured names like Idris Mokhtarzada, founder of the unicorn Truebill, to help build out the platform. So far, it has created a badge for engineers to use on GitHub that calls for a ceasefire and created HTML snippets for people to use on their websites to put up a support ceasefire banner.
Biggar said there are plans to eventually work more with Palestinian organizations and help Palestinian startups with mentorship and cloud credits. TechCrunch previously reported that the war has destroyed much of Palestine’s burgeoning tech industry.
Arfah Farooq, founder of Muslamic Makers, said the last three months have changed everyone in many ways. At the same time, there has been a togetherness and activism that she has never seen before. “I’ve seen firsthand people come together to work for Palestine with nothing but their laptops from across the globe,” she said.
She decided to work with Tech for Palestine after reading Biggar’s viral blog post and has already started to share resources on how to support Palestine. “Due to the siege, we can’t go to Gaza and help on the ground, but we help regardless of where we are in the world,” Farooq said.
One engineer, who asked to remain anonymous, decided to join the coalition because this person felt suffocated at work. This person has agreed to work as an engineer and product manager to help build resources for Tech for Palestine, saying, “I hope this initiative will spark a significant shift and give people their voices back.”
A former tech brand marketer, who is also scared to speak out publicly for fear it will impact a new job search, also told TechCrunch about feeling happy to have a way to get involved with the cause.
“This period has been incredibly isolating to Arabs, Muslims and other people of color in VC and tech,” she said. “Tech for Palestine is a necessary initiative. When we are seeing mobilization around the world and the U.S. in the numbers of hundreds of thousands calling for peace and [the] humanization of the Palestinians, the tech community can no longer be silent.”
The Tech for Palestine initiative comes as the death toll among Palestinians continues to rise. In recent weeks, U.S. officials have reportedly prodded Israel to do more to protect civilians in Gaza even as they have called U.S. support for Israeli security unshakable.
Biggar hopes, at the very least, that this new coalition will augur a larger shift in people speaking up.
“The narrative has only just turned,” he said. “We are working to enable many more who feel silenced to speak out, we are only getting started.”","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1367359752.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-01-02 21:15:40
https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/terran-orbital-receives-key-payment-from-rivada-space-adjusts-year-end-cash-balance/,"Terran Orbital receives key payment from Rivada Space, adjusts year-end cash balance","Terran Orbital has updated its anticipated financial results for the year’s end after the company received a long-awaited payment from its largest customer, Rivada Space Networks.
The news, announced today, confirms earlier reports from TechCrunch that Terran CEO Marc Bell was expecting at least some payment from Rivada before the close of the year.
Rivada, a German subsidiary of U.S.-based Rivada Networks, has ambitious plans to build a megaconstellation in low Earth orbit. The company contracted Terran to build 300 satellites at a total anticipated cost of $2.4 billion. The contract is Terran’s largest by far, representing the vast bulk of the company’s backlog.
While Terran did not disclose the exact payment amount, the company did say that Rivada is now up-to-date on all outstanding invoices. Terran added that it expects to receive additional incremental payments this year and that it is on track to deliver satellites in 2025 and 2026.
As a result of the payment, Terran adjusted its anticipated year-end cash balance from $38.7 million as of the end of September to an excess of $70 million by the end of December. On the whole, it’s great news for Terran Orbital, which has seen its stock crater since making its public market debut at $10.96 per share. But an incremental payment from its largest customer will no doubt help shore investor confidence as the company moves into a new year.
Terran Orbital, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol LLAP, saw a slight bump in its stock price from the news, moving from $1.14 as of previous close to $1.26 as of publication time.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1474001528.jpg?resize=1200,781",2024-01-02 21:09:48

After two years working with web3, Puma’s tech revenues remain modest, but the sportswear manufacturer intends to be ready for a more crypto-friendly future. “Web3 is a big shift in how people use the internet,” Dashkov said. Such changes to how the internet is used can lead to landscape-shifts for brands, something that Puma is more than aware of.
The company “missed the boat” on the big e-commerce and social media waves that happened in the past few decades, so it wants to be early in this space, Dashkov explained. “We don’t think the way the space exists today will be what it looks like in four or five years, but we want to be ready.”
In February 2022, Puma registered its first Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domain, as Puma.eth. ENS domains are popular among Ethereum users who want to have accessible addresses, usually related to themselves or a brand, instead of copying and pasting a string of randomly generated letters and numbers.
In June 2023, Puma launched Black Station and Black Station 2, which its website refers to as “experimental 3D spatial playground,” which is a lot of words to basically describe a metaverse. I tested out the entry page and found it to be a bit slow and confusing (disclaimer: I’m not a huge gamer, so maybe I’m missing the point, but I imagine not all Puma fans are either.) Regardless, its metaverse aims to provide consumers with a different way to interact with the brand, Dashkov said.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/m-s-8-store-ny.jpg?resize=1200,900",2024-01-02 20:19:45
https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/great-now-we-have-to-become-digital-copyright-experts/,"Great, now we have to become digital copyright experts","When news broke last year that AI heavyweight OpenAI and Axel Springer had reached a financial agreement and partnership, it seemed to bode well for harmony between folks who write words, and tech companies that use them to help create and train artificial intelligence models. At the time OpenAI had also come to an agreement with the AP, for reference.
Then as the year ended the New York Times sued OpenAI and its backer Microsoft, alleging that the AI company’s generative AI models were “built by copying and using millions of The Times’s copyrighted news articles, in-depth investigations, opinion pieces, reviews, how-to guides, and more.” Due to what the Times considers to be “unlawful use of [its] work to create artificial intelligence products,” OpenAI’s “can generate output that recites Times content verbatim, closely summarizes it, and mimics its expressive style, as demonstrated by scores of examples.”

The Times added in its suit that it “objected after it discovered that Defendants were using Times content without permission to develop their models and tools,” and that “negotiations have not led to a resolution” with OpenAI.
How to balance the need to respect copyright and ensure that AI development doesn’t grind to a halt will not be answered quickly. But the agreements and more fractious disputes between creators and the AI companies that want to ingest and use that work to build artificial intelligence models create an unhappy moment for both sides of the conflict. Tech companies are busy baking new generative AI models trained on data that includes copyright-protected material into their software products; Microsoft is a leader in that particular work, it’s worth noting. And media companies that have spent massively over time to build up a corpus of reported and otherwise created materials are incensed that their efforts are being subsumed into machines that give nothing back to the folks who provided their training data.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-GRN.jpg?resize=1200,900",2024-01-02 18:58:45
https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/steamboat-willie-mickey-mouse-public-domain/,Public domain Mickey Mouse is the first meme of 2024,"The new year marks the nerdiest holiday you maybe didn’t know about: Public Domain Day. But this year’s celebration is extra special. After years of legal battles, “Steamboat Willie,” a 1928 Walt Disney short featuring Mickey Mouse, is now public domain.
No, that doesn’t mean that you can take the character of Mickey Mouse as we know him today and do whatever you want. But, Mickey Mouse as he appears in the “Steamboat Willie” animation? That’s public domain, baby.
Every January 1, a bunch of old works of literature, music and art enter the public domain, meaning that no one holds exclusive rights to the work anymore. Some works are created to be public domain from the get-go, but previously copyrighted works become public domain because the copyright can expire over time. Copyright law differs from country to country, but to put it simply, the concept of the public domain is why there’s a Winnie the Pooh slasher film (which has a 3% rating on Rotten Tomatoes…), or a queer “Great Gatsby” retelling.
Already, there have been multiple horror movie and video game adaptations announced that will feature the version of Mickey Mouse from “Steamboat Willie.” Generally, “because I can” is not an inspiration that generates great art (see, again, the Rotten Tomatoes rating on “Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey”), but these are the situations in which life imitates a YouTube comments section: everyone wants to be “first.”
Mickey Mouse has already been remixed in certain media, like the TV show South Park, which created an egomaniacal Mr. Mouse character who is obsessed with owning everything. Mr. Mouse is an obvious rip off of Mickey, but depictions like this can be protected under a different subset of copyright law. Under fair use doctrine, some behaviors that might seem like copyright violations are legally permissible if they are transformative or satirical in nature (but of course, these are subjective parameters, which is a whole other can of legal worms).
Any notable work that enters the public domain will garner attention. But part of why there is such an excess of surprise “Steamboat Willie” adaptations is because Disney worked so hard to prevent this day from ever arriving.
The next 5 years of Steamboat Willie content pic.twitter.com/SoBanKpslO — ToonHoleChris (@toonholechris) January 1, 2024
“Steamboat Willie” was slated to enter the public domain in 1984, but Disney managed to extend that copyright for 40 more years through extensive government lobbying for two different copyright extension acts. First, Disney pushed for Congress to pass the Copyright Act of 1976, which delayed “Steamboat Willie” and Mickey Mouse’s public domain debut until 2004. By the 1990s, Disney continued to lobby for further extensions, which gave us the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998, making “Steamboat Willie” safe until just a few days ago.
“Many people thought that Disney would keep up this fight. But I personally don’t find it that surprising that this day has finally come,” wrote Casey Fiesler, an associate professor of information science at CU Boulder. “It was inevitable. And it would have been both a hard fight and a PR nightmare to postpone this yet again.”
Some of Disney’s most iconic works were adapted from public domain stories, like “The Little Mermaid” by Hans Christian Andersen, or the Brothers Grimm’s stories about Cinderella and Rapunzel. So, critics of Disney found its extensive lobbying for copyright extension to be hypocritical, with some even referring to the 1998 law as the “Mickey Mouse Protection Act.”
On social media, avid meme-makers derive joy from the humiliation of large corporations. It’s like a David vs. Goliath situation, in which random posters want to feel as though they, random people on the internet, can actually stand up to untouchable corporations. The internet delighted to watch as someone abused Twitter’s botched blue check system to impersonate pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and declare that insulin was free. It’s like when the Bernie Sanders mittens meme went viral, and even an Amazon corporate Twitter account posted its own Bernie meme. And when users responded by pointing out that Sanders is one of Amazon’s most vocal critics, the meme was quickly deleted.
So, the version of Mickey Mouse from “Steamboat Willie” seems to be everywhere right now. Among crypto folk, some people are already making “Steamboat Willie” NFTs, which is a good idea that definitely won’t result in any scammy behavior. And among the nihilistic meme-makers, we’re seeing AI-generated images of Mickey Mouse doing 9/11, Mickey Mouse confessing to the murder of JFK and many more extreme representations of Mickey that we do not dare repeat on this website. People don’t make these memes because they actually endorse the idea of Mickey Mouse conducting a terrorist attack, but simply because they can.
This builds upon an existing, ongoing meme, in which people use generative AI to create the most heinous representations of copyrighted media possible, like pregnant Sonic the Hedgehog, or Hatsune Miku attending the January 6 riots. Only this time, there’s really nothing stopping the Mickey memes, so long as the creator explicitly references only the version of Mickey Mouse that appears in “Steamboat Willie.”
“Steamboat Willie” itself is surprisingly a ripe source material, considering that it’s a seven-minute short with no dialogue. While we’re used to seeing Mickey Mouse as an ultra-sanitized, wholesome figure, the 95-year-old “Steamboat Willie” film shows a different side of the mouse. Mickey gets blasted in the face with cow pee, throws a potato at a parrot, turns a goat into a music box and pulls on the tails of baby pigs to use them as instruments. His personality would fit better in “Tom and Jerry” than “Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.”
“Steamboat Willie” may be the first meme of 2024, but the novelty of poking fun at Disney will only last for so long. And if people aren’t careful, they might still face the ire of the mouse.
“We will, of course, continue to protect our rights in the more modern versions of Mickey Mouse and other works that remain subject to copyright, and we will work to safeguard against consumer confusion caused by unauthorized uses of Mickey and our other iconic characters,” Disney wrote in a statement in December.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-01-02-at-9.58.27 AM.png?resize=1200,809",2024-01-02 18:16:15

The update also brings new animations, enhancements to the app’s bot platform and more.
The company says it has redesigned calls and added backgrounds that change dynamically based on the call’s status: ringing, active or ended. The new interface requires fewer resources than before, which means it saves battery life and works better on older devices. The update also brings improvements to call quality. Telegram says it plans to launch more improvements to connection and audio quality in 2024.
Telegram is also launching updates to its bot platform, which lets developers integrate services into the Telegram ecosystem. Bots can now react to messages and manage reactions, quotes and links, send replies to other chats or topics, and more. Bots can also get information about giveaways and boosts in channels where they are admins.
Additionally, Telegram is bringing its vaporize animation to both iOS and Android users after previously testing it with select users. The new effect plays whenever you delete a message, and is designed to bring a bit of fun to the app.
The launch of the new features comes a month after Telegram announced improvements to channels, emoji customization for reactions and stats for stories to compete better with WhatsApp, which launched its broadcast channels features to all users in September 2023. Although Telegram has had channels for a long time now, the app has to keep innovating in order to compete with WhatsApp.
Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently said in his broadcast channel in WhatsApp that the channels feature had crossed the mark of 500 million monthly active users. For context, WhatsApp has more than 2 billion monthly active users and Telegram has over 800 million monthly active users.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GettyImages-503572806.jpg?resize=1200,854",2024-01-02 17:29:52
https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/mit-scientists-are-working-on-a-vibrating-obesity-pill/,MIT scientists are working on a vibrating obesity pill,"MIT likens a new vibrating capsule to drinking a glass full of water prior to eating. Dieticians recommend the latter as a method for sending signals to your brain to simulate the sensation of being full. The researchers behind the new project further suggest it as a future alternative to surgery and GLP-1s. The latter, which includes semaglutides like Ozempic and Wegovy, are both extremely popular and prohibitively expensive, owing in large part to pharma IP laws.
MIT’s capsule has seen some laboratory success. Giving test animals the pill 20 minutes before eating reduced their consumption by around 40%, per the team. Like the glass of water trick, the capsule stimulates mechanoreceptors, which send a signal to the brain through the vagus cranial nerve. Once activated, the brain kicks off the production of insulin, GLP-1, C-peptide and PYY hormones, decreasing hunger while ramping up the digestion process.
“The behavioral change is profound, and that’s using the endogenous system rather than any exogenous therapeutic,” associate professor Giovanni Traverso notes. “We have the potential to overcome some of the challenges and costs associated with delivery of biologic drugs by modulating the enteric nervous system.”
The capsule, which is roughly the size of a standard multi-vitamin, contains a vibrating motor, powered by a silver oxide battery. After reaching the stomach, gastric acid dissolves the outside layer and completes the circuit, kickstarting the vibration.
Beyond efficacy, the team is working to determine the system’s safety. That requires a method for ramping up production and eventual human testing. “At scale, our device could be manufactured at a pretty cost-effective price point,” says post-doc researcher, Shriya Srinivasan.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/early-stage-hard-tech-firm-countdown-capital-shutting-down/,Early-stage hard tech firm Countdown Capital shutting down,"Countdown Capital, an early-stage venture capital firm focused on hard tech industrial startups, will shut down by the end of March and return uninvested capital, firm founder and solo general partner Jai Malik said in an annual letter.
In the letter, which was viewed by TechCrunch, Malik says he decided to close the fund after coming to two main conclusions on the economics of early-stage hard tech investing: that “funding industrial startups is not inefficient enough to justify our existence” and that “larger, multi-stage venture firms are best positioned to generate strong returns on the most valuable industrial startups.”
In other words, that the firm would be unlikely to realize excess returns consistently based on capital limitations and swelling competition from large incumbents.
The three-year-old firm’s sudden closure suggests that there are stronger headwinds for early-stage hard tech funds than the overtly optimistic narratives about “building for America” might suggest. The incisively-written letter reads like a cold glass of water to the face.
“Despite our performance to date, I’ve concluded that new investments are unlikely to yield strong returns,” Malik says. “As a result, I no longer believe that Countdown’s existence is justified, for both our LPs and Countdown management.” Malik declined to comment on this story.
The firm has backed some of the better-known names in the aerospace and defense sector, including large satellite bus developer K2 Space, machining startup Hadrian, and cybersecurity company Galvanick. A total of 12 investments are listed on the firm’s website. Among Countdown’s LPs included Craft Ventures’ David Sacks, Banana Capital’s Turner Novak and Homebrew VC’s Hunter Walk.
Notably, Countdown was relatively early to the American hard tech Renaissance; the firm closed its first fund well before Andreessen Horowitz launched its American Dynamism practice, likely the largest and best-known U.S. fund focused on shoring up “the national interest” across sectors like manufacturing, aviation and others.
TechCrunch covered Countdown’s second $15 million fund in September 2022; at the time, Malik said that the firm was filling a void at the very early stages for capital-intensive businesses. A year and a bit on, however, it’s clear that the early-stage opportunities Malik was targeting have not shaken out as anticipated. Countdown’s first fund was $3 million.
The letter posits larger narratives about early-stage hard tech industrials investing that throw into doubt the ability of small, specialist funds to compete against multi-stage incumbents.
Malik explicitly touches on this fact toward the end of the letter, when he writes: “To be clear, we’re not bearish on venture capital or the future success of venture-scale hard tech companies at large. We’re bearish on the ability of small, early-stage funds — particularly sectionally focused ones — to continue exploiting these opportunities profitably.”
In the letter, Malik connects large multi-stage firms investing in hard tech industrial startups to the slowdown in growth in software-as-a-service (SaaS) businesses. But he says that the rate of overall value growth for industrial startups will not outpace the rate of investment from large firms. “Consequently, we think early access to the best companies for a specialized, early-stage venture firm like Countdown will become more limited,” he says. “The most successful early-stage, specialist firms may simply resemble less-profitable ‘derivatives’ of top-performing multi-stage firms, like Founders Fund.”
Malik goes on to say that he thought Countdown had or could develop competitive advantages to outcompete against other firms, multi-stage or early-stage, but that these “are unlikely to prevail.” These advantages could be things like incubation or other approaches that require more time and money than the small-AUM firm could afford.
He said that this lack of competitive advantage was already noticeable: In three cases, Countdown came close to investing in a company’s first round, only for the firm to be priced out by a larger multi-stage firm: “A 50-100% price difference at the pre-seed and seed stage is immaterial to a multi-stage firm managing billions of dollars, but can and should be the difference between a yes and no for a firm of our size.”
Another issue, Malik says, is that the top-performing industrial startups are inaccessible to early-stage firms because they are priced efficiently early on. For example, Malik estimates that Anduril, The Boring Company and Redwood Materials were priced at roughly $60 million, $1 billion and $200 million, respectively, in their first outside rounds; Countdown would’ve had to invest an enormous portion of its fund to acquire even just 3% of each company.
By the end of March, the firm will complete all pending investments, return capital, cancel all uncalled commitments and permanently cease operation apart from current asset management, Malik said.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/51870446669_f94575721f_o.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-01-02 16:36:22
https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/ev-tax-credit-eligibility-tesla-ford-chevy/,Here are the 5 EVs that qualify for the full federal tax credit in 2024,"The U.S. government has revealed the list of electric vehicles that qualify for the full federal tax credit under the newer, more stringent guidelines, and you can count them on one hand. General Motors’ outgoing Chevy Bolt, plus certain variants of the Ford F-150 Lightning and Tesla’s Model 3, Model Y and Model X are now the only EVs that are eligible for the $7,500 rebate.
Beyond that, certain variants of Rivian’s R1S and R1T, plus a handful of plug-in hybrids, qualify for $3,750. Chrysler’s Pacifica plug-in hybrid was able to stay eligible for the full credit. Otherwise, that’s all.
Until this list was published Monday, the new requirements had many people scratching their heads about what, exactly, would qualify. Even Tesla admitted in its own way that it wasn’t exactly sure.
The reason the list is so anemic is because lawmakers are trying to force the EV supply chain to shift — or at least diversify away — from China to North America in the long run. In the short term, that means automakers who rely heavily on Chinese suppliers, specifically for battery materials and components, are losing eligibility. This is on top of a few other baked-in restrictions, like the fact that the vehicles must be built in North America, and must retail for less than either $55,000 or $80,000, depending on vehicle type.
While it will be harder to find a vehicle that qualifies for the federal EV tax credit, the credit itself is much better for consumers in two key ways. First, the credit is now applied when buying the car, meaning you won’t have to wait to claim it on your tax returns.
Second, buyers no longer have to have a tax liability equal to or greater than the amount of the credit — a rule that previously kept a lot of buyers from accessing the credit in the first place. (That said, buyers still have to have certain adjusted gross income to qualify. Here’s a list of FAQs from the IRS.)
Some automakers, like GM, have said they are working on replacing components that are disqualifying their EVs from the credit, so the list could grow as the year goes on. A slew of automakers and suppliers are rushing to build new factories in North America in order to ease the burden in the years to come. But until that happens, here’s the full list of what’s eligible:
Full $7,500 tax credit
Chevrolet Bolt EV
Chevrolet Bolt EUV
Chrysler Pacifica PHEV
Ford F-150 Lightning Extended Range
Ford F-150 Lightning Standard Range
Tesla Model 3 Performance

https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/crowdfunding-is-actually-good/,Debunking the myth that crowdfunding is only good for cash,"Equity crowdfunding, or raising funds from both unaccredited and accredited investors, can be a great alternative to venture capital for startups. The strategy has become significantly more popular in recent years now that venture capital is harder to come by, and changes in regulations allow companies to raise more money at one time.
But even though crowdfunding is growing in prominence and offers a whole host of benefits to the startups that choose it, many VCs continue to talk negatively about the strategy. Many traditional investors feel equity crowdfunding is only for startups that can’t raise venture money. And they even deem capital raised this way as just cash that lacks the value an investor brings, be it their network that can help with hiring and connections to customers, or their own mentorship and experience.
Still, startups that have been down the crowdfunding road say that VCs are just talking their own book.
Chris Lustrino, the founder and CEO of crowdfunding data platform KingsCrowd, thinks crowdfunding definitely isn’t just for raising capital. KingsCrowd has been able to get repeat investors, customers and even talent from their crowdfunding campaigns, he told TechCrunch+, adding that he’s seen numerous other startups do the same.
“I would argue that the venture capital value-add is next to none in reality,” Lustrino said. “They want to hold on to their monopoly.”","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1191380440.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-01-02 16:00:13

https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/rivian-deliveries-slip-10-in-q4-raising-demand-questions/,"Rivian deliveries slip 10% in Q4, raising demand questions","Rivian reported Tuesday it produced 17,541 vehicles at its Normal, Illinois factory and delivered 13,972 to customers in the fourth quarter, mixed results that left investors wary and sent shares down in pre-market trading.
Rivian shares sank 9.75% to $21.17 at 1:40 pm ET.
Rivian had shown consistent growth in production and deliveries in the first three quarters of the year. And while production numbers continued on that upward trajectory in the fourth quarter, deliveries dipped by 10.2% from the previous quarter. That drop could signal softening demand for the company’s slate of premium EVs. Rivian produces four vehicles: its two consumer vehicles, the R1T truck and R1S SUV, and two versions of its commercial van.
Slowing demand for high-priced EVs has plagued automakers, forcing many to scale back production or cut prices. Rivian has managed to avoid slashing prices. If deliveries continue to fall into 2024, the automaker may have to take that strategy in an effort to boost its numbers. That would spell trouble for Rivian, which is not yet profitable.
The cost of building one Rivian vehicle continues to be a barrier to the company’s path toward profitability. Rivian’s consumer R1T and R1S vehicles sell for more than $80,000, on average. But the cost of building far exceeds any revenue it brings. In the second quarter, for instance, the company lost $32,495 on every vehicle it built.
Rivian said during its third-quarter earnings that it narrowed that per unit loss by $2,000 compared to the second quarter by simplifying its product portfolio and reducing material and labor costs. Cutting the sticker price would only put more pressure on margins.
On a full-year basis, Rivian produced 57,232 vehicles and delivered 50,122. This exceeded the automaker’s most recent full-year 2023 production guidance of 54,000 vehicles.
The company also announced that it will report fourth-quarter earning after markets close February 21.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/rivian-Your_electric_adventure_awaits._Reserve_an_R1T_228.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-01-02 14:40:40

They fear the impact of plagiarism and machine-generated essays and the “hallucinations” — where the system confidently asserts something is true that isn’t simply because it doesn’t know any better — of tools like ChatGPT and Bard. There’s a palpable concern that generative AI will become a substitute for authentic learning: something that will help a person pass a test without the need to absorb and internalize the material.
While there is no doubt that AI has been used to circumvent the learning process, ChatGPT has already assumed the role of an ad hoc personal tutor for millions, changing learning consumption patterns and enhancing our relationship with education. The possibility of an AI-powered teaching assistant — one that mentors, encourages, and guides learners through the material in a one-to-one relationship — is within grasp. And the scalability of AI means that anyone can benefit from it.
AI can make — and, for many, already has made — learning addictive. The reasons why have little to do with cutting-edge advancements in AI and computer science and more to do with the fundamentals of what makes a learner engaged, motivated, and excited.
Growing up in Armenia, I was enthralled by the fiercely competitive math Olympiads, and my desire to win drove me to spend hours studying and practicing. Yet, as an adult, I couldn’t find that same motivation while studying math at MIT. I’ve spent a great deal of my life researching and understanding the motivations behind learning, some of which I’ve distilled into this piece and much of which led to me founding CodeSignal.
What do we mean by addictive?
Education has always been centered around the human element, and it’s hard to imagine a world where machines can replace that.
When I talk about AI making learning addictive, I’m talking about a sense of excitement and eagerness — instilling a voracious appetite for self-improvement and growth within a learner. But, more importantly, it continues long after they’ve accomplished what started their journey. Essentially, this boils down to sustained, long-term motivation. Creating self-motivated learners is a challenge that most educators face, and a mountain of educational research touches on this topic.
It’s hard to overstate the importance of motivation. Whether you’re learning to speak a new language or taking the first steps to a career in programming, learning is inherently iterative, where the learner gradually builds confidence and fluency over time. The prolific programming educator Zed Shaw once described this as “climbing a mountain of ignorance.” Those first few months — when you aren’t confident and don’t understand the subject — are the hardest, and it’s all too easy to give up. And that’s why you need an external force to encourage the learner to keep going. Confidence, ability, and perhaps even greatness are just around the corner.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GettyImages-482765551.jpg?resize=1200,720",2024-01-02 14:35:55
https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/tesla-2023-sales-figures-price-cuts/,Tesla's cheapest cars helped it notch another record year,"Tesla shipped a record number of electric vehicles in the fourth quarter to help it edge out its targets for the year. The company delivered 1.81 million EVs in 2023 and built 1.85 million, according to a Tuesday morning press release.
Those figures were slightly above the 1.8 million goal Tesla announced at the beginning of this year, and were overwhelmingly driven by the company’s most affordable EVs, the Model 3 and Model Y. The two models accounted for more than 96% of the vehicles Tesla built and shipped this year.
Tesla built nearly 500,000 cars in the fourth quarter alone at its factories in California, Texas, Germany and China, and delivered 484,507 worldwide. That includes the first few Cybertrucks, which started shipping late last year at a price tag of around $100,000. But we don’t know exactly how many Cybertrucks the company has sent to customers to date as it is lumping in those figures with Model S and X sales in an “other models” line item.
The strong finish to the year comes after Tesla saw its deliveries decline in the third quarter for the first time in a year, owing to some factory shutdowns — something that impaired CEO Elon Musk’s loftier goal of building 2 million cars this year. The company spent much of the year tinkering with its prices, starting with big price cuts, which has taken a huge bite out of its industry-leading profit margins.
Tesla’s big year is also due in large part to the company’s success in China, where competition for market share is becoming fierce due to waves of price cuts from competitors. That includes BYD, which has recently been on track to outpace Tesla’s EV global sales.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2021-Tesla-Model-Y-Goodbye-085.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-01-02 14:26:58
https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/openai-dublin-data-controller/,OpenAI moves to shrink regulatory risk in EU around data privacy,"While most of Europe was still knuckle deep in the holiday chocolate selection box late last month, ChatGPT maker OpenAI was busy firing out an email with details of an incoming update to its terms that looks intended to shrink its regulatory risk in the European Union.
The AI giant’s technology has come under early scrutiny in the region over ChatGPT’s impact on people’s privacy — with a number of open investigations into data protection concerns linked to how the chatbot processes people’s information and the data it can generate about individuals, including from watchdogs in Italy and Poland. (Italy’s intervention even triggered a temporary suspension of ChatGPT in the country until OpenAI revised the information and controls it provides users.)
“We have changed the OpenAI entity that provides services such as ChatGPT to EEA and Swiss residents to our Irish entity, OpenAI Ireland Limited,” OpenAI wrote in an email to users sent on December 28.
A parallel update to OpenAI’s Privacy Policy for Europe further stipulates:
If you live in the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland, OpenAI Ireland Limited, with its registered office at 1st Floor, The Liffey Trust Centre, 117-126 Sheriff Street Upper, Dublin 1, D01 YC43, Ireland, is the controller and is responsible for the processing of your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy.
The new terms of use listing its recently established Dublin-based subsidiary as the data controller for users in the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland, where the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is in force, will start to apply on February 15 2024.
Users are told if they disagree with OpenAI’s new terms they may delete their account.
The GDPR’s one-stop-shop (OSS) mechanism allows for companies that process Europeans’ data to streamline privacy oversight under a single lead data supervisory located in an EU Member State — where they are “main established”, as the regulatory jargon puts it.
Gaining this status effectively reduces the ability of privacy watchdogs located elsewhere in the bloc to unilaterally act on concerns. Instead they would typically refer complaints back to the main established company’s lead supervisor for consideration.
Other GDPR regulators still retain powers to intervene locally if they see urgent risks. But such interventions are typically temporary. They are also exceptional by nature, with the bulk of GDPR oversight funnelled via a lead authority. Hence why the status has proved so appealing to Big Tech — enabling the most powerful platforms to streamline privacy oversight of their cross-border personal data processing.
Asked if OpenAI is working with Ireland’s privacy watchdog to obtain main establishment status for its Dublin-based entity, under the GDPR’s OSS, a spokeswomen for the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) told TechCrunch: “I can confirm that Open AI has been engaged with the DPC and other EU DPAs [data protection authorities] on this matter.”
OpenAI was also contacted for comment.
The AI giant opened a Dublin office back in September — hiring initially for a handful of policy, legal and privacy staffers in addition to some back office roles.
At the time of writing it has just five open positions based in Dublin out of a total of 100 listed on its careers page, so local hiring still appears to be limited. A Brussels-based EU Member States policy & partnerships lead role it’s also recruiting at the moment asks applicants to specify if they’re available to work from the Dublin office three days per week. But the vast majority of the AI giant’s open positions are listed as San Francisco/U.S. based.
One of the five Dublin-based roles being advertised by OpenAI is for a privacy software engineer. The other four are for: account director, platform; international payroll specialist; media relations, Europe lead; and sales engineer.
Who and how many hires OpenAI is making in Dublin will be relevant to it obtaining main establishment status under the GDPR as it’s not simply a case of filing a bit of legal paperwork and checking a box to gain the status. The company will need to convince the bloc’s privacy regulators that the Member State-based entity it’s named as legally responsible for Europeans’ data is actually able to influence decision-making around it.
That means having the right expertise and legal structures in place to exert influence and put meaningful privacy checks on a U.S. parent.
Put another way, opening up a front office in Dublin that simply signs off on product decisions that are made in San Francisco should not suffice.
That said, OpenAI may be looking with interest at the example of X, the company formerly known as Twitter, which has rocked all sorts of boats after a change of ownership in fall 2022. But has failed to fall out of the OSS since Elon Musk took over — despite the erratic billionaire owner taking a hatchet to X’s regional headcount, driving out relevant expertise and making what appear to be extremely unilateral product decisions. (So, well, go figure.)
If OpenAI gains GDPR main established status in Ireland, obtaining lead oversight by the Irish DPC, it would join the likes of Apple, Google, Meta, TikTok and X, to name a few of the multinationals that have opted to make their EU home in Dublin.
The DPC, meanwhile, continues to attract substantial criticism over the pace and cadence of its GDPR oversight of local tech giants. And while recent years has seen a number of headline-grabbing penalties on Big Tech finally rolling out of Ireland critics point out the regulator often advocates for substantially lower penalties than its peers. Other criticisms include the glacial pace and/or unusual trajectory of the DPC’s investigations. Or instances where it chooses not to investigate a complaint at all, or opts to reframe it in a way that sidesteps the key concern (on the latter, see, for example, this Google adtech complaint).
Any existing GDPR probes of ChatGPT, such as by regulators in Italy and Poland, may still be consequential in terms of shaping the regional regulation of OpenAI’s generative AI chatbot as the probes are likely to run their course given they concern data processing predating any future main establishment status the AI giant may gain. But it’s less clear how much impact they may have.
As a refresher, Italy’s privacy regulator has been looking at a long list of concerns about ChatGPT, including the legal basis OpenAI relies upon for processing people’s data to train its AIs. While Poland’s watchdog opened a probe following a detailed complaint about ChatGPT — including how the AI bot hallucinates (i.e. fabricates) personal data.
Notably, OpenAI’s updated European privacy policy also includes more details on the legal bases it claims for processing people’s data — with some new wording that phrases its claim to be relying on a legitimate interests legal basis to process people’s data for AI model training as being “necessary for our legitimate interests and those of third parties and broader society” [emphasis ours].
Whereas the current OpenAI privacy policy contains the much drier line on this element of its claimed legal basis: “Our legitimate interests in protecting our Services from abuse, fraud, or security risks, or in developing, improving, or promoting our Services, including when we train our models.”
This suggests OpenAI may be intending to seek to defend its vast, consentless harvesting of Internet users’ personal data for generative AI profit to concerned European privacy regulators by making some kind of public interest argument for the activity, in addition to its own (commercial) interests. However the GDPR has a strictly limited set of (six) valid legal basis for processing personal data; data controllers can’t just play pick ‘n’ mix of bits from this list to invent their own bespoke justification.
It’s also worth noting GDPR watchdogs have already been trying to find common ground on how to tackle the tricky intersection of data protection law and big data-fuelled AIs via a taskforce set up within the European Data Protection Board last year. Although it remains to be seen whether any consensus will emerge from the process. And given OpenAI’s move to establish a legal entity in Dublin as the controller of European users data now, down the line, Ireland may well get the defining say in the direction of travel when it comes to generative AI and privacy rights.
If the DPC becomes lead supervisor of OpenAI it would have the ability to, for example, slow the pace of any GDPR enforcement on the rapidly advancing tech.
Already, last April in the wake of the Italian intervention on ChatGPT, the DPC’s current commissioner, Helen Dixon, warned against privacy watchdogs rushing to ban the tech over data concerns — saying regulators should take time to figure out how to enforce the bloc’s data protection law on AIs.
Note: U.K. users are excluded from OpenAI’s legal basis switch to Ireland, with the company specifying they fall under the purview of its U.S., Delware-based corporate entity. (Since Brexit, the EU’s GDPR no longer applies in the U.K. — although it retains its own U.K. GDPR in national law, a data protection regulation which is still historically based on the European framework, that’s set to change as the U.K. diverges from the bloc’s gold standard on data protection via the rights-diluting ‘data reform’ bill currently passing through parliament.)","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1173441590.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-01-02 14:13:57
https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/fidelity-marks-down-x-to-almost-a-third-of-the-investment-price/,Fidelity marks down X valuation by 71.5%,"Mutual fund company Fidelity has marked down its investment in X holdings — the parent company of X (formerly Twitter) owned by Elon Musk — by 71.5% from the original valuation of shares, according to a new disclosure.
Fidelity spent $19.2 million to acquire a stake in X back in October 2022. The fund manager made a valuation cut of 65% in October 2023. And now in the November 2023 disclosure, the firm has made a further cut in X’s valuation. Notably, Fidelity’s disclosures are one month behind the current date.
X has gone through quite a lot of changes in the past year, including getting a new CEO in former NBCU exec Linda Yaccarino. During an interview at the Code Conference in September 2023, Yaccarino claimed that the company would turn profitable in 2024.
The biggest challenge for the company is to convince advertisers to spend money on the platform. A lot of prominent advertisers — including Apple, Comcast/NBCUniversal, Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery, IBM, Paramount Global, Lionsgate and the European Commission — pulled out from the platform after Musk called an antisemitic conspiracy theory the “actual truth.”
Later in the month, at the DealBook Conference, he told advertisers to go fuck themselves.
“What this advertising boycott is going to do is kill the company,” Musk continued. “And the whole world will know that those advertisers killed the company, and we will document it in great detail.”
In December, Financial Times reported that X will look to appease small and medium businesses to spend ad money on the platform. X contested The New York Times’ claim that the platform will lose $75 million because of an advertiser boycott and told FT that the estimated drop will be around $10-12 million.
“Small and medium businesses are a very significant engine that we have definitely underplayed for a long time “It [was] always part of the plan — now we will go even further with it,” X told the publication.
Musk has also made controversial decisions to restore accounts of previously banned users such as conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, Kanye West, former U.S. President Donald Trump, far-right influencer Andrew Tate and right-wing academic Jordan Peterson.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/twitter-x-logo-musk-pattern-2.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-01-02 08:32:38
https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/oral-peptides-a-new-era-in-drug-development/41404/,Oral peptides: A new era in drug development,"Researchers from the laboratory of Professor Christian Heinis at EPFL have achieved a significant milestone in drug development through oral peptides.
The research opens the door to oral peptides, a new class of orally available drugs, addressing a long-standing challenge in the pharmaceutical industry.
The research, ‘De novo development of small cyclic peptides that are orally bioavailable,’ is published in Nature Chemical Biology.
“There are many diseases for which the targets were identified, but drugs binding and reaching them could not be developed,” explained Professor Heinis.
“Most of them are types of cancer, and many targets in these cancers are protein-protein interactions that are important for the tumour growth but cannot be inhibited.”
Cyclising breakthrough in oral peptides
The study focused on cyclic peptides, which are versatile molecules known for their high affinity and specificity in binding challenging disease targets.
At the same time, developing cyclic oral peptides has proven difficult because they are rapidly digested or poorly absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract.
The research team targeted the enzyme thrombin, which is a critical disease target because of its central role in blood coagulation. Regulating thrombin is key to preventing and treating thrombotic disorders like strokes and heart attacks.
To generate cyclic oral peptides that can target thrombin and are sufficiently stable, the scientists developed a two-step combinatorial synthesis strategy to synthesise a vast library of cyclical peptides with thioether bonds, which enhance their metabolic stability when taken orally.
Heinis said: “We have now succeeded in generating cyclic peptides that bind to a disease target of our choice and can also be administered orally.
“Therefore, we have developed a new method in which thousands of small cyclic oral peptides with random sequences are chemically synthesised on a nanoscale and examined in a high-throughput process.”
The two steps, one pot method
The new method process involves two steps and takes place in the same reactive container, a feature chemists call ‘one pot’.
The first step is to synthesise linear peptides, which then undergo a chemical process of forming a ring-like structure. This is done using bis-electrophilic linkers – chemical compounds used to connect two molecular groups – to form stable thioether bonds.
In the second phase, the cyclised peptides undergo acylation, which attaches carboxylic acids to them, further diversifying their molecular structure.
The technique eliminates the need for intermediate purification steps, allowing for high-throughput screening directly in the synthesis plates, combining the synthesis and screening of thousands of peptides to identify candidates with high affinity for specific disease targets – in this case, thrombin.
When tested on rats, the oral peptides showed up to 18% bioavailability, which means that when the cyclic peptide drug is taken orally, 18% of it successfully enters the bloodstream and has a therapeutic effect.
Since orally administered cyclic peptides generally show a bioavailability below 2%, increasing that number to 18% is a substantial advance for drugs in the biologics category, including peptides.
Future ambitions of this pharmaceutical breakthrough
By enabling the availability of cyclic oral peptides, the team has opened up possibilities for treating various diseases that have been challenging to address with conventional oral drugs.
The method’s versatility means it can be adapted to target a wide array of proteins, potentially leading to breakthroughs in areas where medical needs are currently unmet.
“To apply the method to more challenging disease targets, such as protein-protein interactions, larger libraries will likely need to be synthesised and studied,” explained Manuel Merz, PhD student and leader of the research.
In the next step of this project, the researchers will target several intracellular protein-protein interaction targets for which it has been difficult to develop inhibitors based on classical small molecules.
They are confident that oral peptides can be developed for at least some of them.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Low-Res_Graphical_abstract_highresolution.jpg,2024-01-02 11:45:10
https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/nutrition-insecurity-caused-by-climate-change-to-be-reduced-with-new-policies/41405/,Nutrition insecurity caused by climate change to be reduced with new policies,"According to a new study, nutrition insecurity in sub-Saharan Africa needs to be combated with crops that are resilient to climate change.
Farmers in sub-Saharan Africa need to diversify away from growing maize and switch to crops that are resilient to climate change to increase nutrition security.
Instead of maize, farmers should begin to grow fruits, vegetables, and crops like cassava, millet, and sorghum to provide the micronutrients essential for good health.
The researchers argue that the quantity of food produced must also increase, and more land must be brought into agricultural production.
More than 50 researchers contributed to the investigation, published in the scientific journal Nature Food. The study involved talking to policymakers and other stakeholders in the food and agriculture sectors in four countries in sub-Saharan Africa: Malawi, South Africa, Tanzania, and Zambia.
Sub-Saharan Africa is at risk of food and nutrition insecurity
According to the World Bank, sub-Saharan Africa is home to 1.2 billion people. It is expected that this will rise by 740 million people by 2050.
Farmers will have to increase the amount of food grown at a time when climate change will create extreme conditions – affecting what crops can be grown.
The team believe that the population is at risk of food and nutrition insecurity unless effective ways of adapting to climate change are identified.
Professor Jennie Macdiarmid, from the Rowett Institute at the University of Aberdeen and one of the authors of the paper, said: “The study has highlighted the need to place nutrition at the heart of agricultural policy to avoid the long-term unintended consequence of failing to produce food that can deliver the nutritional needs of the population.
“If policy solutions focus only on increasing production of calories and adapting to be climate smart, it is likely there will be negative consequences for health through nutritionally poor diets.”
Creating a resilient agricultural system
Using the iFEED assessment framework, the researchers investigated policy options to create an agricultural system that is resilient to climate change and combats nutrition insecurity.
“Too often food, agriculture and nutrition policies sit in siloes across different government departments,” said Dr Jennings, a Research Fellow in the School of Earth and Environment at the University of Leeds.
“This study provides holistic evidence that combines information on the environmental impacts of food system changes and the changes needed for population-level nutrition security.
“The research shows that action can be taken to adapt to climate change and improve nutrition security in sub-Saharan Africa.”
A transformative approach is needed to incorporate nutritional needs
Stakeholders in each country found key uncertainties in the future of the food system. iFEED considers these uncertainties and identifies agricultural policies to be contemplated.
To combat nutrition insecurity, scientists argue that there needs to be a fundamental shift in agriculture.
One option is to diversify into soybean production. This is because soybean crops are more likely to withstand the impacts of climate change compared to maize.
Dr Ndashe Kapulu said: “Many countries in sub-Saharan Africa will be better able to handle climate change and other stresses if they have more diverse food systems, such as the transition to soybean production in Zambia.
“As scientists, we need to generate enough evidence in our research to help make changes that support and guide actions to make the agrifood system more resilient.”
Increasing the production of animal-based products
In sub-Saharan Africa, increasing the production and consumption of animal-based products could fight nutrition insecurity. However, the researchers argue that it should not reach the unsustainable production levels seen in higher-income countries.
An increase in animal-based products would cause a rise in greenhouse gas emissions, but this could be tolerable to reduce sub-Saharan Africa’s need to reduce the risk of nutritionally inadequate diets.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/©-shutterstockCreative-Nerd_1379661350-1024x576.jpg,2024-01-02 11:42:55
https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/uk-government-fails-to-deploy-motorway-ultra-rapid-ev-chargers/41398/,UK Government fails to deploy motorway ultra-rapid EV chargers,"Research conducted by the RAC indicates that the UK Government has fallen short of its ambitious goal of deploying rapid or ultra-rapid EV chargers across motorway services in 2023.
The target was to have six or more rapid or ultra-rapid EV chargers available at every motorway service point, yet the reality paints a different picture.
Out of the 119 motorway service areas scrutinised by the RAC using Zapmap, merely 46, accounting for 39%, have achieved the intended number of chargers exceeding 50kW – a crucial capacity to cater to the burgeoning fleet of battery-electric vehicles.
Moreover, the number of rapid or ultra-rapid EV chargers has grown from just 27 (23%) from the end of April.
The goal was imperative considering the expectation that the UK’s electric vehicle count would surpass the one million mark by the end of 2023.
UK’s roadmap for EV charging
The government’s ‘Taking Charge: the Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Strategy’ aimed to expedite high-powered charger deployment via the £950m Rapid Charging Fund.
However, delays ensued, with the announcement of a £70m grant for a pilot scheme at ten motorway service stations only in early December 2023.
While the government foresees approximately 300,000 public chargers and over 6,000 high-powered chargers along strategic roads by 2035, forecasts from the Competition and Markets Authority suggest a larger requirement of 280,000-480,000 public charge points by 2030.
Areas for improvement in UK motorway services
Although there has been a notable increase in high-powered chargers, with an additional 178 installed since spring, the progress remains insufficient. Encouragingly, more than half of the services (55%) now offer ultra-rapid EV chargers, accelerating the process for drivers.
However, concerning gaps persist. Shockingly, four service areas—Leicester Forest on both sides of the M1, Tebay South on the M6, and Barton Park on the A1(M)—lack any charging facilities. Furthermore, only 18 service areas lack rapid EV charging above 50kW.
Comparative figures between the RAC research and Zapmap’s charging statistics reveal that a mere 6% of all high-powered chargers are available at motorway services, underlining the pressing need for accelerated infrastructure development.
Simon Williams, an RAC EV spokesperson, commented: “It’s clear from our research that the government has fallen well short of its target of having six high-powered chargers at every motorway service area in England.
“While that’s the case, some very good progress has been made since the end of April when we last carried out our survey, with four-in-ten services (39%) now having met or exceeded the target number of chargers, compared to just under a quarter (23%) eight months ago.
“There is undoubtedly an eagerness among charge point companies and motorway service operators to install these types of units but unfortunately, it’s often the high-power cabling to the grid that’s the major barrier which is out of their hands.
“More clearly needs to be done to make this process simpler than it is currently. Hopefully, once the government’s Rapid Charging Fund kicks fully into action some of these hurdles will be overcome.
“We continue to believe that the wide availability of ultra-rapid charging is crucial in giving both current and future EV drivers confidence to know they can easily make journeys beyond the range of their vehicles in a time-efficient way.”
Increasing charging compatibility
The analysis also sheds light on connector types, showcasing a 48% increase in Combined Charging System (CCS) connectors and a 32% rise in CHAdeMO connectors, addressing compatibility concerns for different electric car models.
The shortfall in meeting charging infrastructure targets signals the necessity for expedited action to support the burgeoning EV landscape and provide drivers with the confidence to undertake longer journeys without concerns about charging accessibility.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/©-shutterstockAmani-A_1488128222.jpg,2024-01-02 10:48:00
https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/habitable-planets-to-be-identified-with-atmospheric-co2-levels/41386/,Habitable planets to be identified with atmospheric CO2 levels,"An international team of researchers have found that atmospheric CO2 levels hold the key to discovering habitable planets.
The team aims to find habitable planets and potentially life itself by comparing the amount of carbon dioxide in their atmosphere to neighbouring planets.
Compared to neighbouring planets, if a planet has a reduced amount of CO2 in its atmosphere, it suggests the presence of liquid water on the surface. The researchers can infer that a drop in carbon dioxide levels is a result of being dissolved into an ocean or sequestrated by planetary biomass.
The work is published in the journal Nature Astronomy.
What is the habitable zone?
Habitable planets are capable of hosting and retaining liquid water on their surfaces. If a planet is too close to its star, it is too hot, those too far away are too cold, and those in the habitable zone are just right.
The habitable zone is sometimes referred to as the Goldilocks zone.
No current method for detecting planet habitability
Although researchers have attempted to identify planets in the theoretical habitable zones of their stars, there was previously no way to find out if they had liquid water on their surfaces.
The scientific community have made great progress in defining biosignatures – chemical tracers of biological processes, but there has been no method for detecting habitable planets until now.
Devising a new habitability signature
The team came up with a habitability signature which can be used to identify whether a planet has liquid water.
Before this, scientists attempted to identify the presence of liquid water by looking at how starlight reflects off water.
However, this signature is too weak for current observatories to detect, whereas the new habitability signature can be applied with ease.
Amaury Triaud, Professor of Exoplanetology at the University of Birmingham, who co-led the study, said: “It is fairly easy to measure the amount of carbon dioxide in a planet’s atmosphere. This is because CO2 is a strong absorber in the infrared, the same property causing the current rise in global temperatures here on Earth.
“By comparing the amount of CO2 in different planets’ atmospheres, we can use this new habitability signature to identify those planets with oceans, which make them more likely to be able to support life.
“For example, we know that initially, the Earth’s atmosphere used to be mostly CO2, but then the carbon dissolved into the ocean and made the planet able to support life for the last four billion years or so.”
Dr Julien de Wit, co-leader of the study, added: “Despite early hopes, most of our colleagues had eventually come to the conclusion that major telescopes like the JWST would not be able to detect life on exoplanets. Our work brings new hope.
“By leveraging the signature of carbon dioxide, not only can we infer the presence of liquid water on a faraway planet, but it also provides a path to identify life itself.”
Providing insights into environmental tipping points
As well as being a method to identify habitable planets, the research can also be used to gain insights into environmental tipping points.
Triaud explained: “By examining the levels of CO2 in other planets’ atmospheres, we can empirically measure habitability and compare it to our theoretical expectations. This helps gather context for the climate crisis we face on Earth to find out at which point the levels of carbon make a planet uninhabitable.
“For example, Venus and Earth look incredibly similar, but there is a very high level of carbon in Venus’ atmosphere. There may have been a past climatic tipping point that led to Venus becoming uninhabitable.”
The next steps for the team
The researchers will now detect the atmospheric carbon dioxide compositions of a range of exoplanets and identify which have oceans on their surface.
The team will prioritise further observations of potentially habitable planets.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/©-shutterstockDarryl-Fonseka_1672248802.jpg,2024-01-02 09:45:06
https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/navigating-the-next-wave-of-ai-and-iot/41382/,Navigating the next wave of AI and IoT,"Jonathan Boakes, Managing Director, UK at Infinum, details how success in AI and IoT lies with a solid business strategy.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have become two of the most powerful digital transformation tools.
With new connected devices being developed daily, Allied Market Research forecasts the global IoT market will reach $4.4 trillion by 2026, up from $740 billion in 2020. The market for AI is also expected to show strong growth in the coming decade. Its nearly $100bn value is set to grow twentyfold by 2030, up to almost $2tr.
AI and IoT present a whole realm of opportunities, challenges and potential downfalls for businesses, so how can companies be confident that digital transformation will succeed?
AI and IoT success in practice
From the micro-sensors found within Bluetooth-connected toothbrushes to the software that powers complex manufacturing machinery on an assembly line, IoT tech is diverse and capable of processing huge amounts of data between devices.
The benefits of AI and IoT are not just about the data quantity but the capacity to collect volumes of quality data close to the source where it’s being produced. This works through IoT components that collect, process, and share data from various sources or endpoints, providing a rounded data narrative rather than one source alone.
For example, NutriU is a central hub for kitchen appliances that helps people control their smart appliances remotely through their phones, discover recipes, and receive personalised cooking recommendations in a single app. The platform’s Machine Learning-based recommendation system suggests recipes tailored to individual tastes. At the same time, its AI and IoT integration allows users to manage their Philips kitchen gadgets from anywhere, enabling convenient and customised cooking experiences. This is being used in 37 countries and 30 languages, transforming how people prepare meals and interact with their devices.
The untapped potential of AI and IoT holds promise for cost savings, personalised experiences, efficiency gains, and improved interactions for both businesses and consumers. While progress is underway in some sectors, there’s further ground to cover and opportunities to explore.
How healthcare is leading the revolution
AI and IoT are teaming up in healthcare to transform patient care, making it one of IoT’s fastest-growing sectors. Being a highly regulated and complex industry, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) innovation requires extensive research, testing, and adherence to strict standards for digital solutions.
Examples of IoMT are medical devices and wearables, such as those that monitor real-time health data, such as heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and glucose levels. Obtaining this comprehensive health data allows chronic conditions to be monitored as patients go about their daily lives.
Recent research shows 75% of healthcare leaders plan to invest in AI in the next 12 months. Given the innovations healthcare has spearheaded with IoT, this sector has enormous potential to lead the revolution with both elements of this cutting-edge tech.
Being perceptive to the AI hype
However, leaders across sectors must be wary of embracing AI and IoT without a clear strategy. Research shows that while nine out of ten CTOs plan to invest in AI within the next 12 months, nearly 75% admit they are unprepared to do so.
Aside from the obvious challenges associated with implementing a new technology that the business isn’t ready for, companies need to exercise collective caution as everyone looks to jump on the bandwagon.
When every company says they’re using AI to change their industry, it raises the risk of sky-high expectations. It becomes a recipe for customer retention problems, particularly if it fails due to a lack of understanding or poor implementation.
In 2024, businesses must not allow industry peer pressure to lead them to rush into AI for the sake of it. Experience tells us that you can either begin with a clear strategy or begin to fail.
Instead, with the right strategy and implementation, AI has the potential to be game-changing for businesses of all sizes and industries.
Tread with spirited caution
When building AI and IoT solutions, you’re not just handling the user, app, and cloud but also multiple connected devices, all exchanging information in real-time in a culmination of hardware and software. Because of this, it can be difficult for companies with legacy systems to make the transition smoothly.
Start by thinking about your users. Is your IoT solution compelling enough to cause users to switch away from their current approach to the problem? Sometimes, the dumb solution is smarter than the smart one. Does your proposed business model align with the amount and method your customer might pay?
Successful IoT implementation is a piecewise game that requires you to think around the next corner. Staying ahead of the curve in IoT means more than just keeping up with the latest trends.
It involves creating systems that are antifragile and capable of withstanding changes at a minimised change cost.
Additionally, having the means to source volumes of data is just one element. An IoT platform can bring this data to life, allowing businesses to utilise it for specific needs. These can be categorised into cloud-based, edge-based, and hybrid platforms. Each can cater to scalability, latency, reliability, privacy, and security requirements.
Above all else, there must be a careful assessment of the device requirements regarding the scale needed and how this will be deployed within core target markets, with factors like device authentication, identity management, and data security at the top of mind.
Scaling isn’t simply increasing production volume. It requires transforming your entire digital ecosystem to continuously deliver value to a potentially large base over several years. IoT products are still digital, and their development continues beyond production. Continuously improving and maintaining these products is essential for long-term success.
Beyond just installing sensors and models, digital transformation requires a deeper understanding of extracting, analysing, and positioning the data generated by these sensors through software, bridging between the user and the device.
The entire industry is fixated on AI’s potential for revolutionising processes, but the true game-changer lies in coupling it with IoT. However, success demands a solid strategy and an unwavering dedication to consistently provide value to end-users via ongoing research, identification, and adaptation.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shutterstockgreenbutterfly_2070595583.jpg,2024-01-02 09:32:42
https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/why-innovation-is-crucial-to-successful-sustainable-water-management/40079/,"Why innovation is crucial to successful, sustainable water management","Ofwat’s Innovation Fund sets out to encourage, and engage the community in sustainable water management.
Water companies provide drinking water and wastewater services to over 50 million people in England and Wales, with a sewage network that could wrap around the world 13 times. As the population increases and places growing demand on already ageing networks, the sector faces undeniable and urgent challenges that require action now. This, together with a fast-changing climate, means it is critical we all work towards more sustainable water management.
The importance of sustainable water management
One of the most pressing considerations is how we can avoid water waste and make the best use of the resources available. In the UK, we’re privileged that clean, safe drinking water is always available on tap – quite literally – and that our wastewater from the sinks, toilets, dishwashers and washing machines is easily flushed away. The supply of drinking water and removal of so-called ‘grey water’ – lightly used water such as that emptied from a dishwasher or washing machine – is simply not a problem consumers need to worry about.
However, as we face increasingly uncertain seasonal and weather patterns, driven largely by climate change, we could struggle to continue to maintain the equilibrium of water we need. Droughts could leave the country parched and on hosepipe bans for months at a time, with consequential sudden downpours hitting dry, cracked ground and causing storm overflows due to lack of absorption.
The vital task of managing and delivering sustainable water management is essential. Beyond the water sector itself, cities, urban planning, transport, logistics and energy all play roles in helping ensure that this water is reasonably and effectively managed. That’s why it’s so important that the water sector takes the lead in bringing the right minds together to guard this precious resource.
Moreover, there won’t be water to guard unless we can maintain healthy, functioning ecosystems. These are crucial for the water sector to deliver the services and outcomes needed by people, communities, and the environment. There is a shared responsibility to protect people and the natural world; from preserving precious water supplies, helping customers and communities, and preserving and enhancing wildlife.
Why we’re establishing policies that protect our future water
Water companies have always had a clear environmental and societal footprint. They’re one of a handful of key long-term stakeholders in their communities, providing services which are both essential and environmentally sensitive, and have a significant role to play in helping to address some of the main challenges society faces. There are increasing societal expectations that company decisions are driven by a broad range of environmental and social factors.
In keeping with this, the last few years have seen Ofwat develop and implement a number of policies that prioritise protection, improvement and regulation within sustainable water management. For example, at the start of last year (January, 2022), we published a position paper on net zero ambitions, welcoming the Water UK 2030 Routemap on carbon as an important step towards the industry becoming net zero by 2050.
The paper highlighted that in order to achieve that goal, water companies must go beyond what is proposed in the Routemap by also tackling operational and embodied carbon emissions; carbon that is emitted while infrastructure is being run, as well as being built.
As part of this, Ofwat called on water companies to align their plans to the national government’s net zero targets in England and Wales. We know that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions produced by water companies need to be reduced and ideally eliminated rather than using offsets to reduce their emissions.
In developing their approaches to net zero, water companies must ensure their plans are clear, transparent, and capable of being understood by the wider public. This is crucial as it will allow stakeholders – including local leadership, other utility suppliers and ultimately users – to appropriately support and challenge plans, focusing on achieving the best value for customers and the environment.
The role of innovation in ensuring a sustainable future of water
Ofwat is also investigating other ways to help water companies reach net zero – particularly through innovation and our £200m Innovation Fund.
The Innovation Fund, which was launched in November 2020, was started to grow the water sector’s capacity to innovate, enabling it to better meet the evolving needs of customers, society and the environment. Now on the sixth competition, the fund seeks to encourage new ways of working that go beyond business-as-usual innovation practices in the water industry, in particular, increasing and improving collaboration and building partnerships from within and outside the water sector.
The fund has awarded over £105m to 77 projects so far. The competitions – most of which have targeted the water sector, but all of which have encouraged collaboration – have recognised ideas from water companies alongside universities and institutes, retailers, start-ups, technology companies, charities, and small businesses.
Winners of the competitions so far include initiatives to tackle environmental problems related to the water industry, such as greenhouse gas emissions, projects to prevent and address leakage, and technology to help citizens monitor the health and pollution levels of local rivers.
Although many water companies have already started to innovate themselves – introducing state-of-the-art technology to tackle climate change, including advanced reservoir systems, sensors, satellites and drones – this fund was a real turning point in enabling and accelerating bolder ideas. The funding pot has permitted out-of-the-box thinking without the same funding challenges that would be met if water companies were working alone.
Why is it important to engage communities in sustainable water management?
For all that water companies can do to generate and implement methodology and technology to boost sustainable water management, these changes can’t take place in silo. We need entire communities to truly see the benefits of innovative practices. Whether this is business partners, industry groups, local leaders or everyday consumers, changes require numerous community touchpoints to become meaningful and productive.
Within the winning cohorts of the Ofwat Innovation Fund, there are a number of examples that show how important it is to engage communities in sustainable water practices from the outset.
The first of these is Enabling Water Smart Communities, which takes a fresh look at how resources are used in new housing developments and focuses on how to reduce water use in the home – in part through reusing greywater.
This is an example of an innovation that requires the immediate local community – the homeowners – to work with their water company to change their behaviour and water usage. If potential users are engaged from the outset, the results could be significant.
Similarly, the Severn Trent Home Energy Recovery Unit (HERU) team is testing converting plastic and wet wipes found in wastewater to energy. They are looking to upgrade an existing under-sink burner unit and explore uses for the hydrogen it produces.
Currently, 75% of drain blockages are caused by flushing wet wipes down the toilet,1 not only is this a significant pollutant affecting animals and wildlife, but also a major cause of sewer blockages.
If the new energy unit can be adapted and rolled out, it will be available for commercial and domestic sites and will rely on communities of colleagues and homeowners to see if it is a plausible way to manage one of the water sector’s biggest challenges.
Finally, just this year, we’ve seen the launch of the Big River Watch – a new app developed by Rivers Trust alongside numerous partners, as part of CaSTCo – another initiative funded by the Ofwat Innovation Fund. The app, which is available to all members of the public, encourages citizen science by asking everyone to complete a short survey when spending time near their local river.
The data gathered from these surveys will be collated and analysed by experts, then used to inform understanding of local river health and areas for improvement.
By seeking the involvement of local communities, this project will ensure accurate and up-to-date monitoring of river health across the nation.
Ensuring sustainability in the water sector by tackling carbon
Sustainable water management is just one element of ensuring the sector becomes more environmentally friendly overall. The sector needs to improve a number of different climate-related issues for water itself to be sustainable.
One early competition winner has particular potential to help solve one of the biggest sustainability challenges affecting the industry – the issue of whole life carbon, which describes carbon from all stages of operation and use.
The UK water sector has a long history of measuring, managing and reducing carbon emissions. The UKWIR Carbon Accounting Workbook was created in 2006. Two years later, frameworks for measuring whole life carbon were released.
This early collaboration provided the foundation for sector performance today – leading to the ambitious goal of achieving net zero emissions before the government target of 2050.
Although the sector pledged to continue to reduce the capital carbon (the carbon emissions associated with the creation of an asset) in 2019 to help reach net zero operational emissions by 2030, to date, there is no system to accurately capture whole life carbon metrics.
The Enabling Whole Life Carbon project set out to tackle several challenges that the water sector still faces when working towards net-zero emissions, better carbon data systems and integration and data interpretation.
The team developed a common carbon (the universal method of measuring a building’s carbon footprint) cost-management framework, aligned to industry standards (PAS 2080), and digital design tools to enable the visualisation of carbon and cost hotspots in real-time so that multiple parts of the value chain could be viewed.
The framework also includes guidance on building a carbon data library, calculating whole life carbon, aligning carbon, cost and data models, visualising data, embedding visualisation into data and governance processes, and managing organisational change.
Enabling Whole Life Carbon is, therefore, one example of how innovation can help to secure more sustainable water management for the industry by tangibly providing a method that can encourage companies to meet important policy targets.
Restoring water ecosystems as part of industry sustainability
Another Ofwat Innovation Fund winner helping to improve wider industry sustainability is Project Seagrass. This innovation, which seeks to boost biodiversity, capture carbon and improve water sustainability, will initially look to provide a blueprint for restoring seagrass in the UK, creating opportunities to ‘rewild’ the sea and reduce carbon and nitrogen emissions.
Seagrass meadows enhance the stability of the coastal zone, trapping carbon in the seabed, boosting water quality and, with it, wildlife. The project will provide a road map to unlock the ‘blue carbon’ potential (carbon captured by marine ecosystems) of seagrass restoration for the water industry and beyond.
Recent estimates suggest that seagrass loss in the UK may be as high as 92%. This project aims to create blue carbon frameworks that would enable wider roll-out and incentivise the use of carbon offsets in the UK.
Currently, there is significant demand for this with industries looking to move beyond tree planting. Introducing a blue carbon framework will ultimately lead to this as a possibility – not only for the UK but also internationally.
A sustainable future for water
Although there is plenty more to be done to reach a point where we have a truly sustainable water sector, we have also achieved a lot – largely through innovation.
From initiatives that better monitor, track, and capture carbon, to the rewilding of natural waterways, it is clear that new technologies, methodologies and scientific breakthroughs hold the keys to a better, more effective use of our water resources.
It is exciting to know that our funding is driving part of these changes and we hope that not only will they help the sector to meet key targets, but also provide benefits for wider society and the environment for many years to come.

https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/how-to-increase-ev-uptake/39503/,How to increase EV uptake,"Beth Burmahl, Argonne Associate at Argonne National Laboratory, outlines the role of the laboratory in increasing EV uptake.
Decarbonisation requires a large-scale transition to zero-emission electric vehicles (EVs). Sustainability is increasingly at the forefront of innovation, with the world recognising the need for alternative energy sources, battery development, and advanced technology to mitigate the effects of climate change. The US is well on the way towards an electric future. More than 1% of the vehicles on the road are electric, and 6% of the vehicles sold last year were hybrid or fully electric vehicles.
Widespread EV adoption is dependent on their ability to present a viable, competitive alternative to petrol and diesel vehicles. To do this, the limitations of EVs must be understood and resolved. By building batteries that can store more charge safely, accelerating charging, and modelling the impacts of EVs, the U.S. Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory is part of the effort to provide these answers and pave the way for the next generation of vehicles.
EV uptake requires improved charging
Key to significant EV uptake is improving the speed and efficiency with which drivers can charge their vehicles. Currently, charging time can take anywhere from 30 minutes to overnight. Argonne researchers are currently part of the eXtreme Fast Charge Cell Evaluation of Lithium-Ion Batteries (XCEL) initiative, which aims at reducing the charging time to 15 minutes or less.
To better understand the limitations associated with the lithium-ion batteries that power electric vehicles, scientists are exploring a variety of different cell designs. At Argonne, these battery cells undergo rigorous testing and characterisation both during the testing cycle and afterwards. Research in XCEL has already demonstrated a 50% increase in the energy density – equivalent to the driving range held by a battery – that is possible with fast charging.
This transition to EVs requires the appropriate infrastructure to be in place. By 2030, the US Government hopes to roll out more than half a million public EV chargers across the country. The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program, supported by Argonne, will distribute $5bn to states to create the massive infrastructure.
Creating equal access to EV charging
Seeking equal access to electric vehicle charging for all US residents, Argonne developed the interactive Electric Vehicle Charging Justice Map to help states align their efforts with the federal goal to allocate 40% of federal benefits, including funding for clean transportation, to underserved communities.
To encourage EV uptake, governments and the general public alike must be convinced of their economic benefits. The JOBS EVSE 2.0 tool developed by Argonne helps assess the economic benefits related to installing charging stations. Users can use the tool to calculate the economic impacts associated with development and operation of charging stations, including new jobs.
Taking advantage of innovative technology
Transitioning to a greener, more sustainable society requires us to take advantage of innovative technology. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and advanced quantum computers are now a reality that can, and should, be utilised to improve energy efficiency and mitigate environmental impacts. Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are already beginning to roll off the assembly line, and fully driverless cars may be soon to hit the road.
Using Argonne’s RoadRunner tool, researchers can create road environments that effectively ‘talk’ to particular CAVs, informing them when another car or hazard is ahead. Using RoadRunner, the Argonne team has developed algorithms that can reduce fuel consumption by CAVs by 15-22%.
New technology is being deployed daily to reduce EV prices and help cut greenhouse gas emissions. It is difficult to accurately assess the true costs and environmental impacts of these vehicles, taking into consideration the entire EV lifecycle – from materials and production, through to use and recycling. This information is essential for completing a successful, comprehensive shift to EVs.
Environmental benefits of EVs
Argonne is a global leader in lifecycle analyses of vehicles, thanks to the laboratory’s Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions and Energy use in Technologies (GREET) model. GREET has been employed to quantify greenhouse gas emissions from both the fuel and production life cycles of EVs. Using this model, Argonne is able to analyse the environmental trade-offs in owning an EV versus a conventional vehicle.
A pair of reports issued in 2022 revealed that EVs may soon become less expensive to own and operate than traditional gas-powered vehicles, while cutting greenhouse gas emissions by more than half. Research and innovation are proving successful, and with continued commitment to the EV supply chain, large-scale transition may not be so far away.

Request an invite here.
No matter which side you think will win the battle, there is no doubt that the New York Times’ new lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement, filed last Wednesday, will be one of the most important copyright fights to watch in 2024.
The Gray Lady vs. the Generative AI Bros? Pass the popcorn, please. The lawsuit maintains the defendants should be held responsible for “billions of dollars in statutory and actual damages” related to the “unlawful copying and use of The Times’s uniquely valuable works.” It also calls for OpenAI and Microsoft to destroy any chatbot models and training data that use New York Times copyrighted material.
Here’s why this case is so munch-worthy in what may be a make-or-break year for AI and copyright: For one thing, legal experts have long predicted that a case around AI and copyright could make it to the Supreme Court — and a high profile case like the New York Times vs. Microsoft and OpenAI could be just the ticket to a date with the nine justices.
Generative AI copyright battles have been brewing for over a year
Back in August 2022, before ChatGPT was released, I spoke to Bradford Newman, a partner at law firm Baker McKenzie in its Palo Alto office, about the legal battles brewing around generative AI.
VB Event The AI Impact Tour Getting to an AI Governance Blueprint – Request an invite for the Jan 10 event. Learn More
“Legally, right now, there is little guidance,” he warned. “There are the inevitable class actions, but the net net of it all is when you’re using the massive data sets that these AI applications are and you sprinkle on top of that open source licenses…the arguments are going to be fair use versus infringement.”
Different courts, he predicted, will come to different conclusions. “Ultimately, I believe this is going to go to the Supreme Court.”
In addition, industries affected by generative AI are not taking a wait-and-see attitude when it comes to copyright issues, particularly in areas such as publishing and entertainment. Marc Rotenberg, president and founder of the nonprofit Center for AI and Digital Policy, as well as an adjunct professor at Georgetown Law School, spoke to me in September for a deep-dive article into copyright issues around AI training data. He was waiting, he said, for the New York Times to make a legal move against OpenAI.
The New York Times-OpenAI matchup has arrived
He pointed to the famous Authors Guild v. Google, a federal copyright case that centered on whether Google Books’ effort to digitize books constituted “fair use,” and wound its way through the courts for a decade before being decided in Google’s favor in 2015.
“Google did very well there in the outcome as a legal matter, but the publishers and the news industry did not, and there was a real consequence that the publishing industry and journalism is in trouble,” Rotenberg told me. “It’s the reason that the New York Times, which survived the first battle, even as many regional and local news organizations collapsed, is suddenly aware that they may be in trouble too.”
The big takeaway, he continued, is that if AI models, which need high-quality data, could also replicate what the New York Times offers, the news giant could go out of business. “So to me, it’s one of the most interesting legal cases today involving AI…the looming battle between one of the most well regarded publishers, The New York Times, and one of the most impactful generative AI firms OpenAI.”
OpenAI lawyers are ready to play defense
There is no reason to doubt that OpenAI and Microsoft are fully-prepared to play strong defense in this case. Back in July, I spoke to a prominent attorney specializing in copyright law who is helping to defend OpenAI in at least one of the cases filed in 2023 by authors accusing the company of infringing their copyrights. He told me that the cases focused on generative AI and copyright will play a huge role in “shaping the pace and contours of innovation” as well as the understanding the role of copyright law.
“I think every 20 years or so, there’s a new, really significant question that comes along and forms how the commercial world works,” he said. “We had a case in the early 1980s that went to the Supreme Court over the VCR. We had a whole wave of cases over Web 2.0 to figure out how this new law called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act works, or user generated content. I think what we’re seeing right now is the next big wave of litigation over these tools that are going to, if you ask me, have a profound effect on society.”
At the time, he told me was “quite confident” that the position of the technology companies on copyright “is the one that should and hopefully will prevail,” adding that copyright is often invoked to solve problems it was not meant to solve.
“It’s just really bad for using the regulated labor market, or privacy considerations, or whatever it is — there are other bodies of law that deal with this concern,” he said. “[Copyright is] just not the right instrument for that. And I think happily, courts have been sort of generally pretty faithful to that concept.”
But either way, he emphasized, changing copyright law for the sake of protecting any industry is a “really terrible decision” that will never work because the laws will not apply outside the US. “These tools are going to continue to exist,” he said, and there will be a tremendous amount of jurisdictional arbitrage in terms of where these companies are based, in terms of the location from which the tools are launched.”
Simply put, he said: “You couldn’t put this cat back in the bag.”",https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Untitled-design-2024-01-02T105616.348.png?w=1200&strip=all,2024-01-02 17:29:48

This will enable users to access voice, text, and data services anywhere, even in remote areas or disaster zones.Earlier, SpaceX was granted permission by the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to conduct a pilot project for its Starlink mobile service. The project will test the use of satellites to provide internet access to smartphones across the US using T-Mobile's spectrum to send data to unmodified phones on the ground via Starlink satellites. The FCC granted SpaceX an ""experimental special temporary authorization"" for 180 days, or until June 14 next year, with the approval coming a week after the company received a partial nod to deploy the Starlink mobile service. However, the initial approval restricted SpaceX from doing any other testing besides checking the functionality of the satellite antennas.SpaceX had originally planned to launch this mission in mid-December but faced some technical issues that delayed the launch.The company’s founder and CEO, Elon Musk, said on X that the DTC feature was a “massive game changer” that would eliminate the problem of cellular dead zones. He also clarified that the DTC feature was not meant to compete with existing terrestrial networks, as it only supported about 7 megabits per second per beam, and the beams were very large.SpaceX said in a statement that the DTC feature would “enable mobile network operators around the world to provide seamless global access to texting, calling and browsing… on land, lakes or coastal waters.”Musk and T-Mobile’s CEO and President, Mike Sievert, announced the partnership between the two companies in August 2022. Sievert said that the upcoming service in the U.S. would use the existing T-Mobile mid-band PCS spectrum, which was already compatible with most phones in the market.“That allows us to then dedicate that, working together, to the constellation that Starlink operates so that we are seeing those satellites from every corner of the country,” Sievert said. “If you have a clear view of the sky, our vision is you’re connected.”He added that the phones would not know they were connecting to space, as they would use the same industry-standard technology and protocols as they would for terrestrial networks.SpaceX plans to launch about 840 more DTC-capable satellites over the next six months to achieve a critical mass of satellites for commercial service by late 2024. The company has requested the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) to grant it a launch license for all 7500 satellites in its direct-to-cell modification application, according to an email sent by SpaceX’s director of satellite policy, Jameson Dempsey, to the FCC’s acting division chief of satellite licensing, Kathyrn Medley, on November 30, 2023.

https://interestingengineering.com/science/fossil-face-off-new-discovery-ends-nanotyrannus-vs-t-rex-debate,Growth rings reveal Nanotyrannus wasn't a baby T. Rex,"A team of paleontologists has confirmed that Nanotyrannus, a small and agile tyrannosaur, was a distinct species and not a juvenile of the colossal T. rex. The study, published in Fossil Studies, used growth rings, anatomy, and a newly identified fossil of a young T. rex to settle the long-standing debate.Nanotyrannus, which means “dwarf tyrant,” was first discovered in Montana in 1942. However, its status as a separate species has been controversial, as some scientists argued that it was just a young T. rex that had not yet reached its full size and shape.To test this hypothesis, the fossils were re-examined by Dr. Nick Longrich from the Milner Centre for Evolution at the University of Bath (UK) and Dr. Evan Saitta from the University of Chicago (USA). They conducted a thorough analysis of growth rings, the anatomy of Nanotyrannus, and a newly discovered fossil of a young T. rex that was previously unidentified.They found that Nanotyrannus had different features from T. rex, such as narrower jaws, longer legs, and bigger arms. They also showed that Nanotyrannus was not growing fast but had reached its adult size of about 900-1500 kilograms and five meters - only 15 percent of the size of the giant T. rex, which could weigh up to 8,000 kilograms and measure nine meters or more.The researchers said they were surprised by how clear the results were. They said that if Nanotyrannus was a young T. rex, it should have been growing rapidly, adding hundreds of kilograms a year, but they did not see that. They said they tried different ways to model the data but always needed higher growth rates. They said this ended the idea that Nanotyrannus is a young T. rex.Dr Nick Longrich The researchers also found no evidence of fossils with features of both Nanotyrannus and T. rex, which would be expected if they were the same species. Instead, every fossil they studied could be assigned to one species or the other.Moreover, the researchers discovered a previously overlooked fossil of a young T. rex stored in a museum in San Francisco. The fossil, a skull bone called the frontal bone, had distinctive features that matched T. rex but not Nanotyrannus. It belonged to a small animal with a skull of about 45 cm long and a body length of around 5 meters.The researchers said this was the first fossil of a young T. rex that they had. They said it was just one bone, but it was enough. They said T. rex skull bones were unique; nothing else looked like them. They said young T. rex exist; they are extremely rare, like most dinosaur juveniles.The researchers argued that these findings were strong evidence that Nanotyrannus was a separate species, one not closely related to Tyrannosaurus. They said it was more lightly built and long-limbed than its thick-set relative. They said it also had larger arms, unlike the famously short-armed T. rex.“The arms are actually longer than those of T. rex. Even the biggest T. rex, has shorter arms and smaller claws than in these little Nanotyrannus. This was an animal where the arms were actually pretty formidable weapons. It’s really just a completely different animal - small, fast, agile.“T. rex relied on size and strength, but this animal relied on speed,” Longrich said.The researchers said the long arms and other features suggested it was only distantly related to T. rex - and may have sat outside the family Tyrannosauridae, which T. rex is part of, in its own family of predatory dinosaurs.The new study is the latest in a series of publications on the problem, going back decades.Longrich said: “Nanotyrannus is highly controversial in paleontology. Not long ago, it seemed like we’d finally settled this problem, and it was a young T. rex.“I was very skeptical about Nanotyrannus myself until about six years ago when I took a close look at the fossils and was surprised to realize we’d gotten it wrong all these years.”The researchers propose that the diversity of dinosaurs and other fossil species might be underestimated due to the challenge of distinguishing them based on their frequently incomplete skeletons. As Longrich stated, it is remarkable to consider how much remains unknown about the most renowned dinosaurs, prompting one to question what other misconceptions exist.

https://interestingengineering.com/health/rare-protein-mutation-shields-against-parkinsons-disease-study-finds,How a rare protein mutation protects you from Parkinson’s,"A new study by the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology has revealed a rare genetic mutation in a tiny protein that can protect people from developing Parkinson's disease. This debilitating neurological disorder affects millions worldwide.The mutation occurs in a mitochondrial microprotein called SHLP2, first discovered by USC professor Pinchas Cohen in 2016. The study, published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry on January 3, 2024, shows that people who have this mutation are 50% less likely to get Parkinson's disease than those who do not.The mutated form of SHLP2 is found mainly in people of European ancestry and is present in only 1%. It changes the shape and function of the microprotein, making it more stable and effective in preventing mitochondrial dysfunction, a key factor in the development of Parkinson's disease.As we all know and have read in school, Mitochondria are the cell's powerhouses, producing energy and regulating cellular processes. SHLP2 is one of the many microproteins made within the mitochondria and plays important roles in maintaining their health and function. Previous research by the Cohen Lab has shown that SHLP2 protects against aging-related diseases such as cancer and that its levels vary in patients with Parkinson's disease.""This study sheds light on the molecular mechanisms of Parkinson's disease and opens up new avenues for developing treatments,"" said Cohen, the senior author of the study and a professor of gerontology, medicine, and biological sciences. ""It also demonstrates the potential of exploring mitochondrial microproteins as novel targets for preventing and treating diseases of aging.""The study was led by Su-Jeong Kim, an adjunct research assistant professor of gerontology at the USC Leonard Davis School, who used a large-scale genetic analysis to identify the SHLP2 mutation in thousands of human subjects from three different cohorts: the Health & Retirement Study, the Cardiovascular Health Study, and the Framingham Heart Study. She then performed a series of experiments to confirm the protective effect of the mutation on mitochondrial function and Parkinson's disease risk.She found that the mutation, which is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or a change in one letter of the genetic code, results in a higher expression of SHLP2 and a more stable structure of the microprotein. She also discovered that SHLP2 binds to a crucial enzyme in the mitochondria called mitochondrial complex 1, which generates energy and whose activity declines in Parkinson's disease. By binding more stably to this enzyme, the mutated SHLP2 prevents deterioration and preserves mitochondrial function.The study is part of the USC team's ongoing research on mitochondrial microproteins and their role in aging and disease. It represents a breakthrough in longevity science, precision health, and microprotein discovery.""We hope that our findings will inspire further research on SHLP2 and other mitochondrial microproteins and lead to the development of new therapies for Parkinson's disease and other aging-related disorders,"" Kim said.According to the study, the mutant form of SHLP2 demonstrated positive effects in both human tissue samples and mouse models of Parkinson's disease in in vitro experiments.Kim stated, ""Our data highlights the biological effects of a particular gene variant and the potential molecular mechanisms by which this mutation may reduce the risk for Parkinson's disease. These findings may provide a roadmap for understanding other mutations found in mitochondrial microproteins and guide the development of therapies.""Mitochondrial DNA single nucleotide polymorphisms (mtSNPs) have been associated with a reduced risk of developing Parkinson’s disease (PD), yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we investigate the functional role of a PD-associated mtSNP that impacts the mitochondrial-derived peptide (MDP) Small Humanin-like Peptide 2 (SHLP2). We identify m.2158 T > C, a mtSNP associated with reduced PD risk, within the small open reading frame encoding SHLP2. This mtSNP results in an alternative form of SHLP2 (lysine 4 replaced with arginine; K4R). Using targeted mass spectrometry, we detect specific tryptic fragments of SHLP2 in neuronal cells and demonstrate its binding to mitochondrial complex 1. Notably, we observe that the K4R variant, associated with reduced PD risk, exhibits increased stability compared to WT SHLP2. Additionally, both WT and K4R SHLP2 show enhanced protection against mitochondrial dysfunction in in vitro experiments and confer protection against a PD-inducing toxin, a mitochondrial complex 1 inhibitor, in a mouse model. This study sheds light on the functional consequences of the m.2158 T > C mtSNP on SHLP2 and provides insights into the potential mechanisms by which this mtSNP may reduce the risk of PD.
