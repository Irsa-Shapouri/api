Here's the good, the bad, and the ugly","DevOps engineering is a highly sought-after profession in today's job market. However, becoming a successful DevOps engineer requires a combination of technical expertise and business acumen. Moreover, staying relevant in this field demands a commitment to continuous learning, as popular methodologies quickly become outdated.

The demand for DevOps engineers is soaring, given their role in automating and coordinating both cloud and on-premises environments to ensure seamless software development and deployment. Not only is the job in high demand, but it also offers attractive salaries. In the United States, for instance, the average annual salary for a DevOps engineer is estimated to be around $134,000.

While the role may be rewarding, experienced DevOps engineers caution that it comes with its fair share of challenges. To excel in this field, a solid foundation in technology is essential. According to Brad Morgan, a seasoned DevOps engineer, one of the fundamental skills to acquire is proficiency in Linux. Regardless of the specific responsibilities within a DevOps role, familiarity with Linux is crucial.

In addition to Linux, another key skill for DevOps engineers is bash scripting. This scripting language, which automates Linux commands, is widely utilized in the DevOps world. Many pipelines and workflows employed by DevOps engineers rely on bash scripting. Therefore, it is important to gain proficiency in this area.

Cloud skills are also highly valued in the DevOps field. Familiarity with mainstream cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure can enhance one's employability. Morgan suggests focusing on mastering one cloud vendor's nuances rather than attempting to become a generalist. By specializing in one platform, it becomes easier to learn and adapt to others in the future.

Becoming a DevOps engineer does not follow a formal course of study. Self-learning is the most effective path to pursue a career in this field. According to Morgan and other experienced professionals, a passion for constant learning is a prerequisite for success. The DevOps ecosystem is vast and ever-evolving, with tools and frameworks rapidly changing. Therefore, allocating time for continuous learning and personal development is crucial to staying relevant.

Even as one gains experience, learning remains a constant aspect of the job. The fast pace of technological advancements, including the introduction of AI tools like ChatGPT, means that DevOps engineering today will differ from the role in the future. This continuous learning environment is often cited as one of the most appealing aspects of being a DevOps engineer.

Infrastructure management is a significant component of the job that distinguishes passionate DevOps engineers from their peers. Managing infrastructure involves setting up, configuring, and maintaining cloud infrastructure to support applications. This responsibility entails dealing with servers, databases, networks, and security on a daily basis. While this aspect may excite some individuals, others who prefer software engineering may find it less fulfilling. Building customer-facing applications and flexing coding skills may be more appealing to them.

Transitioning between software engineering and DevOps is possible and has been successfully done by many professionals. Therefore, it is not a career path that locks individuals into one role forever.

Lastly, understanding the business side of DevOps is essential. Unrealistic expectations often prevail, with businesses hoping that hiring a few DevOps engineers will magically solve all their problems. Thus, it is crucial for DevOps professionals to manage expectations and communicate the realities of the role to management.

In conclusion, DevOps engineering offers exciting opportunities for those with a combination of technical skills and business acumen. It is a field that demands continuous learning and adaptation to keep up with the evolving landscape. Proficiency in Linux, bash scripting, and cloud platforms is critical for success.

However, as Microsoft and Google entered the cloud market, AWS's growth rate slowed down. Nvidia, on the other hand, continues to experience significant growth. The question now is whether Nvidia can sustain this growth and become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS. While Nvidia does have other businesses, they are smaller and growing more slowly than its GPU data center business.

In the short term, Nvidia's revenue growth has been astronomical, and it is expected to continue. In its recent earnings report, Nvidia projected $24 billion worth of revenue for the current quarter, a 234% growth compared to the previous year. Although its growth rate is expected to decline, Nvidia is still on track to generate over $100 billion in annual revenue. Analysts predict revenue of $110.5 billion for the current fiscal year, an 81% increase from the previous year.

Looking ahead, AI could be a significant driver of growth for Nvidia in the coming years, despite increasing competition from AMD, Intel, and other chipmakers. Nvidia currently dominates the chip market and is well-positioned to maintain its lead. However, AMD is gaining ground at the board level, according to market share numbers.

In conclusion, Nvidia's growth trajectory resembles that of AWS, but it remains to be seen if it can achieve the same long-term success. With its strong position in the chip market and the potential of AI, Nvidia has the momentum to continue growing. However, it will face challenges from competitors as the market evolves.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/boeing-ceo-to-leave-company-by-year-end-after-a-wave-of-safety-incidents/,Boeing CEO to leave company by year-end after a wave of safety incidents,"Boeing’s CEO, Dave Calhoun, will be stepping down from his position by the end of 2024, as announced by the company. This decision comes in the wake of a series of safety incidents and controversies that have shaken the aircraft manufacturer.

One of the incidents that has plagued Boeing is a cabin panel blowout on one of its planes. This, along with several other serious safety incidents, has raised concerns about the company's commitment to passenger safety.

Boeing has been actively involved in promoting innovation through its Aerospace Xelerated program, formerly known as the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI). This initiative focuses on collaborating with startups in the aerospace industry. It remains to be seen how Calhoun's departure will impact this program, and TechCrunch has reached out to Aerospace Xelerated for comment.

In a statement, Calhoun expressed his intention to continue working on stabilizing and positioning the company for the future in the coming months. This suggests that he is committed to ensuring a smooth transition for Boeing during this challenging time.

The recent emergency landing of an Alaska Airlines' brand-new 737 Max 9 jet has further compounded Boeing's safety crisis. As a result, 171 Max 9 jets were grounded for several weeks. This incident marks the most significant safety crisis for the company since the tragic crashes of two Max 8 jets in 2018 and 2019, which claimed the lives of 346 individuals.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-deep-geothermal-renewable-powerhouse.html,Dig deep: US bets on geothermal to become renewable powerhouse,"Geothermal energy, although currently a small contributor to the US energy production, is gaining attention from businesses and the Biden administration as a potential key player in the green transition. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm believes that utilizing the heat beneath our feet can provide clean, reliable, and scalable power for various sectors. The Department of Energy even predicts that geothermal energy could surpass hydroelectric and solar power in the US by 2050.

Geothermal energy harnesses the high temperatures underground to generate electricity and heat buildings. In 2022, it accounted for only 1.6% of US energy consumption. To increase production, the US government has invested more than $200 million since 2018 in an experimental site in Utah. This site focuses on Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), a technology that involves injecting water into naturally hot rocks located deeper than two miles. Unlike traditional geothermal methods, this approach doesn't rely on hot springs or underground reservoirs.

The potential of EGS lies in its ability to make geothermal energy accessible anywhere. Additionally, this technique reduces the upfront risk associated with drilling, making it more attractive to investors. The US government also facilitates the conversion of permits for oil or gas exploration into geothermal licenses, streamlining the process for interested companies. Moreover, EGS uses fewer chemical additives compared to classic fracking, and geothermal drilling doesn't release hydrocarbons.

Geothermal energy offers a stable flow of energy regardless of weather conditions or time of day, unlike solar or wind power. Furthermore, the US government predicts that the cost of geothermal energy will decrease from $70-$100 per megawatt hour to $45 by 2035. The use of existing drilling technology makes geothermal projects faster and more cost-effective.

While there are experimental EGS sites in other countries like France, the US has been a pioneer in implementing this technology. However, geothermal drilling, similar to fracking, carries a risk of inducing seismic activity. The US Energy Department requires funded projects to follow a mitigation protocol to address induced seismicity and is actively funding research on the matter.

Several startups in the US and Canada have raised substantial investments and are competing in the emerging geothermal market. For example, Fervo Energy, in collaboration with Google, has connected its Nevada site to the electric grid. As the supply of geothermal energy grows, companies like Google, Microsoft, and Nucor are demonstrating their commitment by purchasing geothermal energy.

Despite the potential of geothermal energy, the sector is still in its early stages. The first successful commercial facility will be crucial in inspiring other companies to follow suit. The growth of geothermal energy needs to be approached with responsibility and care. Ultimately, it has the potential to transform the energy landscape and contribute significantly to the green transition.

In conclusion, geothermal energy holds promise as a clean, reliable, and scalable power source. With the US government's investments in EGS technology and the support of major companies, the geothermal sector is poised for growth. As more projects are developed and the industry matures, geothermal energy has the potential to play a significant role in shaping a sustainable future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/a-worker-operates-a-dr.jpg,2024-03-25 04:59:03,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2024/03/25/amid-fintech-slowdown-goldman-sachs-backed-startup-considers-sale-sources-say/,"Amid Fintech Slowdown, Goldman Sachs-Backed Startup Considers Sale","Deserve, a Silicon Valley startup that specializes in launching and managing credit cards for other companies, is facing challenges in the current business and funding environment. The 10-year-old company, which is backed by investors such as Goldman Sachs, Visa, Mastercard, and Accel, has been exploring options such as selling itself due to the slow business and funding market, compounded by the turmoil in the crypto industry. However, Deserve's founder and CEO, Kalpesh Kapadia, has stated that the company is not for sale but is open to strategic discussions regarding partnerships, investments, and mergers.

Since its founding in 2013, Deserve has raised $150 million in equity funding but is yet to turn a profit. According to insiders, the company burned through approximately $15 million to $20 million in 2023. Despite this, Kapadia is optimistic about the company's growth potential and expects ""strong growth"" in the coming year. Deserve aims to reduce its burn rate, generate renewed growth in 2024, and build a self-sustaining and profitable standalone business.

If Deserve were to be sold, industry insiders predict that it would fetch less than its peak valuation in 2021. This is due to the decline in fintech valuations and the specific challenge that Deserve faced when its largest customer, crypto lender BlockFi, went bankrupt. In 2021, Deserve was looking to collaborate with crypto lenders to issue credit cards, but BlockFi's collapse impacted the company's revenue significantly.

Deserve's founder, Kalpesh Kapadia, has an interesting background. He came to the U.S. from India in the mid-1990s for graduate studies and has a master's degree in industrial engineering and an MBA. After working in finance for 15 years, he founded Deserve with the goal of making it easier for underserved populations, such as immigrants and students, to access credit. Initially, Deserve operated as a consumer credit card company, but it later pivoted to help other companies launch credit cards. Its first customer in this new model was Sallie Mae, a student loan bank.

Deserve simplifies the credit card launch process for its customers by handling tasks such as assessing borrower risk, processing transactions, and managing customer service. Despite the pivot, Deserve has maintained its original consumer card business and continues to collect fees and interest income. However, the company has stopped investing in acquiring new customers.

In the past, Deserve experienced a surge in demand from bitcoin companies interested in credit cards. It also partnered with crypto lender BlockFi to launch a rewards card, which became its largest customer. However, BlockFi's collapse and the struggles of other fintech customers have impacted Deserve's revenue. The rise in interest rates and the tight funding market have further compounded the company's challenges.

Deserve currently has 15 customers, half of which are fintech companies like M1, and the other half are banks, including Customers Bank. Competition in the tech-enabled credit card issuing space has intensified over the past year, making it more difficult for Deserve to stand out. Despite these obstacles, Deserve remains focused on navigating the changing landscape and finding opportunities for growth and profitability.

In conclusion, Deserve, a Silicon Valley startup specializing in credit card launch and management, is facing challenges due to the slowing business and funding market, as well as the turmoil in the crypto industry. The company, backed by prominent investors, has explored options such as selling itself but remains committed to building a self-sustaining and profitable business. Deserve's founder, Kalpesh Kapadia, has a vision of making credit more accessible to underserved populations, and the company has pivoted to help other companies launch credit cards. Despite the obstacles, Deserve continues to navigate the competitive landscape and seeks opportunities for growth.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600d053afe6bed0f9b925c9/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 11:57:06,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-large-language-simple-mechanism-knowledge.html,Large language models use a surprisingly simple mechanism to retrieve some stored knowledge,"Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are incredibly complex, and although they are widely used in various applications, scientists still have limited understanding of how they work. To gain insights into their inner workings, researchers from MIT and other institutions conducted a study to understand how these models retrieve stored knowledge.

The researchers made an interesting discovery: LLMs often employ a simple linear function to decode and retrieve stored facts. Linear functions, which involve only two variables and no exponents, capture the straightforward relationship between these variables. Moreover, the model uses the same decoding function for similar types of facts. By identifying linear functions for different facts, the researchers were able to probe the model and determine where it stores knowledge about new subjects.

Using a technique they developed, the researchers found that even when an LLM provides an incorrect answer, it often has the correct information stored. This finding suggests that the approach could be used in the future to identify and correct falsehoods within the model, reducing instances of incorrect or nonsensical answers.

Evan Hernandez, an electrical engineering and computer science graduate student at MIT and co-lead author of the research paper, explains, ""Even though these models are really complicated, nonlinear functions that are trained on lots of data and are very hard to understand, there are sometimes really simple mechanisms working inside them. This is one instance of that.""

The paper was written by Hernandez and co-lead author Arnab Sharma, a computer science graduate student at Northeastern University, along with their advisors and other collaborators from MIT, Harvard University, and the Israeli Institute of Technology. The research will be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations in May 2024.

LLMs, also known as transformer models, are neural networks that consist of billions of interconnected nodes or neurons. These models encode and process data across multiple layers, storing knowledge as relations that connect subjects and objects. For example, the relation ""Miles Davis plays the trumpet"" connects the subject (Miles Davis) to the object (trumpet).

As the transformer gains more knowledge, it stores additional facts about a subject across its layers. When a user asks a question related to that subject, the model must decode the most relevant fact to provide an accurate response. The researchers aimed to understand the mechanism through which the model retrieves these facts.

Through a series of experiments, the researchers discovered that LLMs, despite their complexity, employ a simple linear function to decode relational information. Each decoding function is specific to the type of fact being retrieved. For instance, the model would use one decoding function to output the instrument a person plays and a different function to output the state where a person was born.

To estimate these simple functions, the researchers developed a method and computed functions for 47 different relations, such as ""capital city of a country"" and ""lead singer of a band."" While there are countless possible relations, the researchers focused on this subset as representative examples of facts that can be expressed using linear functions.

To test the functions, the researchers changed the subject and observed if the model could still retrieve the correct object information. The experiment confirmed the effectiveness of the linear functions in retrieving accurate facts.

This study sheds light on the inner workings of LLMs and provides valuable insights into how these models retrieve and decode stored knowledge. The discovery of the simple linear functions used by LLMs opens up possibilities for future research in identifying and correcting falsehoods within these models. Ultimately, this could improve the accuracy and reliability of LLMs, making them even more valuable tools across various domains.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/large-language-models-2.jpg,2024-03-25 09:34:06,Innovation,Innovation

For a limited time, they will be offering a free trial of the game on current generation consoles. Starting on Thursday, March 28 at 8 AM PDT and ending on Sunday, March 31 at 11:59 PDT, players will have a long weekend to dive into the futuristic world of Night City. The free trial will allow players to explore the first five hours of the game, which includes the thrilling Konpeki Plaza heist from the first chapter. The best part? You don't need a subscription to PlayStation Plus or Xbox Live to participate.

But why is CDPR offering a free trial? The idea behind it is simple - they want players to get a taste of the game and become so engrossed in its fixed and optimized gameplay that they can't resist purchasing the full version once the trial ends. And if that's not enough, there's also the highly acclaimed Phantom Liberty DLC, released last fall, which offers a captivating story that can be played midway through the campaign. Many players consider it to be the best story content in the game.

Now, I know what you're thinking - is it really worth playing? Well, considering that it's free, why not give it a go? As someone who was initially disappointed with the game's rocky launch, I can confidently say that Cyberpunk 2077 has become one of my all-time favorite games. It's a masterpiece of a story-driven RPG, boasting some of the most memorable NPCs and questlines in the gaming world. The combat is exceptionally fun, regardless of the build you choose, thanks to the extensive skill tree and Cyberware rework introduced in the game's latest major update.

And let's not forget about the visuals. On PC, Cyberpunk 2077 is an absolute stunner. With its path tracing settings, which were added post-launch, the game is a visual feast for the eyes. It's hard to find another game on the market that can compete with its stunning graphics. Of course, to take full advantage of this, you'll need a powerful rig. Rest assured, though, we are far from the days when the game was unplayable on PlayStation 4, prompting Sony to issue refunds. Please note that this free trial is only available on consoles, not on PC.

As the game launches for free, I'll have a special feature that CDPR has helped me put together, so stay tuned for that. In the meantime, I highly recommend Cyberpunk 2077 if you haven't played it in the last three years. Regardless of what you may have heard about its troubled launch, the game has undergone a remarkable transformation and stands as one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. I only wish I could experience it again for the first time, in its current fixed and upgraded state.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/dma-first-formal-probes/,"Apple, Google and Meta face first formal investigations under EU's DMA","The European Union has recently announced a series of investigations on major tech companies, including Alphabet/Google, Apple, and Meta. These investigations are being conducted under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which aims to regulate and ensure fair competition in the digital market.

Alphabet/Google is under scrutiny for its rules on steering in Google Play and its approach to self-preferencing in search results. Apple is being investigated for its rules on steering in the App Store and the design of choice screens for alternatives to its Safari web browser. Meta's ""pay or consent"" model will also be scrutinized by the Commission.

The EU has announced a total of five investigations, which were initiated less than three weeks after the compliance deadline for these companies. The three gatekeepers designated under the pan-EU market power and contestability regulation are facing formal investigations to determine if they are breaching the rulebook. Violations of the DMA can result in fines of up to 10% of global annual turnover, or even 20% for repeat offenses.

The EU has a maximum of 12 months to conclude the investigations, with a preliminary report expected within six months. However, the duration of the probes may vary depending on the complexity of the cases.

These actions by the EU come as antitrust scrutiny on these three US tech firms continues to increase, even on their home turf. Since the companies unveiled their DMA compliance plans, there has been criticism that the proposals do not fully comply with the new EU law.

Google has been accused of trying to avoid the regulation's ban on self-preferencing by introducing new rich features in search results that unfairly compete with rivals. Apple's use of notifications to warn users of risks when leaving its walled garden has been criticized by developers as ""scare screens."" Meta's ""pay or be tracked"" tactic has also faced condemnation from privacy and consumer rights groups.

The Commission has opened proceedings to assess whether Alphabet and Apple are breaching the DMA's obligations pertaining to app stores. It is concerned that their steering measures may not be fully compliant, as they impose various restrictions and limitations on developers' ability to freely communicate, promote offers, and conclude contracts.

Regarding Google's self-preferencing, the investigation will focus on the impact of its vertical search services on rival services. The Commission is concerned that Alphabet's measures implemented to comply with the DMA may not ensure fair and non-discriminatory treatment of third-party services featured on Google's search results page compared to its own services.

On Apple, the EU will examine whether the company is complying with user choice obligations on iOS, such as allowing users to easily uninstall apps, change default settings, and select alternative default services. The Commission is concerned that Apple's measures, including the design of the web browser choice screen, may prevent users from exercising their choice of services within the Apple ecosystem.

As for Meta, the proceedings will investigate whether its ""pay or consent"" model for EU users complies with the DMA's requirements. The Commission is concerned that this model may not provide a genuine alternative for users who do not consent, thus failing to prevent the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers.

During a press conference, Thierry Breton, the EU's internal market commissioner, emphasized the DMA's requirement for gatekeepers to offer free, non-discriminatory access to their platforms.

These investigations highlight the EU's determination to regulate and ensure fair competition in the digital market. The outcome of these probes will have significant implications for the future of these tech giants and their operations within the European Union.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1031626648.jpg?resize=1200,799",2024-03-25 12:10:10,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/daphneewingchow/2024/03/25/game-changing-campaign-could-improve-food-security-for-africa/,‘Game Changing’ Campaign Could Improve Food Security For Africa,"As the world grapples with the complexities of food security in an ever-changing climate, there is a growing recognition that the focus should be on nutrition and food pathways rather than just calories. This shift in perspective is particularly relevant for Africa, a continent with immense potential for a more resilient and nourishing food future.

Traditionally, the goal has been to ensure that people have enough food. However, Dr. Cary Fowler, U.S. Special Envoy for Global Food Security, emphasizes that the challenge lies not only in filling people's bellies but also in providing good nutrition. A food system should be based on nutrition, and the agricultural system should be designed to accomplish that.

In line with this approach, the Vision for Adapted Crops and Soils (VACS) campaign, a collaboration between the United States Department of State (USDoS), the African Union (AU), and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), has emerged to uncover the hidden treasures of Africa's agricultural landscape. Through two reports, VACS focuses on identifying and promoting climate-resilient crops that meet various criteria, including cultural relevance, climate resilience, and nutrition.

Dr. Fowler describes VACS as a ""game-changer."" Unlike traditional food security campaigns, VACS takes a non-prescriptive approach and emphasizes indigenous culture. It moves away from calorie-dense staples like maize, potatoes, and rice and instead highlights a list of indigenous crops with great potential for productivity, nutrition, and cultural significance. This list includes crops such as fonio, pearl millet, pigeon peas, taro, yams, and lablab.

The selection of these ""opportunity crops"" in the VACS report was based on a comprehensive methodology that involved experts from various disciplines, including plant breeders, nutritionists, and climate scientists. Each crop was evaluated based on criteria related to climate resilience, nutritional value, cultural significance, geographic applicability, business case, and environmental benefits.

In the face of numerous challenges, including climate variability and infrastructural barriers, VACS offers hope and guidance. It is a testament to the power of collective action and shared purpose in shaping a more nourished, resilient, and prosperous future for Africa and beyond.

The heart of Africa bears the heaviest burden when it comes to global food insecurity and climate crises. Devastating floods and prolonged droughts destroy farmlands, leaving millions across sub-Saharan Africa without access to vital nourishment. Women and children are particularly vulnerable, with more than 80% of people in Sub Saharan Africa suffering from iron deficiency.

It is clear that urgent action is needed. VACS is leading the charge towards a brighter tomorrow, recognizing that transformation begins with the African continent. By focusing on climate-resilient crops that are culturally relevant and nutritionally rich, VACS aims to create sustainable food systems that can withstand the challenges of a changing climate.

The time for change is now, and VACS is paving the way with its innovative approach. Through collaboration and innovation, we can build a future where everyone has access to nutritious and resilient food. Let us join hands and support the VACS campaign, one seed, one harvest, and one meal at a time. Together, we can create a more nourished and prosperous Africa.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66019249d6958363c6c73ff4/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3000,1688,x0,y110,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 11:03:56,Innovation,Innovation
