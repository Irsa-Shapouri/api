But before we dive into that, let's not forget that there's still time to grab this month's fantastic lineup, featuring four diverse games, for a few more days. And let me tell you, my prediction for one of the titles, the kung fu action game Sifu, was spot-on this time!

Now, if you're new to PlayStation Plus, let me give you a quick rundown. It's Sony's monthly membership program that grants you access to online gaming. However, it's important to note that you don't need it for streaming movies or TV shows on Netflix or other platforms, nor do you need it for free-to-play games like Warzone or Fortnite. But if you want to enjoy any paid online games, a subscription is required.

Speaking of subscriptions, there are three tiers of PS Plus: Essential, Extra, and Premium. For the purpose of this post, we'll focus solely on the Essential tier's free monthly games. Following a recent price increase, the Essential tier now costs $79.99/year, while the Extra tier is priced at $134.99/year, and the Premium tier at $159.99/year.

Now, let's move on to the burning question: When will Sony reveal the games for next month? Well, typically, Sony unveils the following month's lineup on the last Wednesday of the current month. However, there are exceptions to this rule. In general, the new lineup is released on the first Tuesday of the month, with the games being revealed the previous Wednesday.

Based on this pattern, we can expect an announcement for April's lineup on the morning of Wednesday, March 27th. And mark your calendars because the new games will become available on Tuesday, April 2nd.

As of now, we haven't come across any leaks or rumors regarding April's PS Plus Essential games. It seems like we're in the dark, at least for now. But fear not, as I have a few predictions for you. Please keep in mind that these are purely speculative and some may even fall into the realm of wishful thinking. Perhaps we'll be treated to a simulator or a sports game. The possibilities are endless! Here are a few titles that come to mind:

- Assassin's Creed Valhalla
- Need For Speed Unbound
- The Outer Worlds
- Forspoken
- Demon's Souls
- The Order 1886
- The Last Of Us Part 1
- LEGO Jurassic World
- Marvel's Midnight Suns
- Tales of Arise
- Cult Of The Lamb
- Little Nightmares 2
- Star Wars Jedi: Survivor
- Nier: Automata
- Elden Ring
- Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice
- Metal: Hellsinger
- Donut County
- Dead Island 2
- Metro Exodus
- Gollum
- Skull Island: Rise Of Kong

https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/24/new-whatsapp-warning-iphone-15-pro-max-samsung-s24-ultra-upgrade/,New WhatsApp Warning Suddenly Issued For 2 Billion Users,"WhatsApp, one of the most popular messaging apps globally, has recently launched a significant update. However, there is one feature that users should be cautious about using, as it can have dangerous consequences. In this blog post, we will discuss this feature and why it should be avoided.

2024 is expected to bring about significant changes in the messaging landscape. Various messaging platforms, such as iMessage, WhatsApp, Signal, Google Messages, and Facebook Messenger, are making updates that revolve around end-to-end encryption. This encryption method ensures that messages are secure and private. However, not all platforms offer the same level of security.

WhatsApp has always prioritized end-to-end encryption, making it a reliable choice for users. In fact, the platform has warned that third-party chats are not as secure as WhatsApp-to-WhatsApp chats. The Department of Justice has also expressed concerns about Apple's iMessage security on Android, emphasizing the importance of encryption. Despite these warnings, some media reports have been encouraging users to transfer their chats and chat history from WhatsApp to Telegram.

Telegram, unlike WhatsApp, does not provide end-to-end encryption by default. While it offers a ""secret chat"" option for one-on-one conversations, users must manually enable it for each chat. This lack of default encryption has raised concerns about the platform's security. Kaspersky, a renowned cybersecurity company, has cautioned users about Telegram's security vulnerabilities. Moving chats from WhatsApp, which is end-to-end encrypted by default, to Telegram, which isn't, poses a significant security risk, especially for group chats containing sensitive information from multiple users.

Exporting chats from WhatsApp to Telegram may seem tempting, especially when there is backlash against WhatsApp due to changes in user terms and conditions. However, it is crucial to prioritize security and privacy over convenience. Jake Moore from ESET advises against pulling content out of end-to-end encrypted messaging platforms, as doing so removes the protective barriers designed to safeguard messages. While Telegram promotes easy cross-platform usage, this convenience is possible because its content is accessible through its central servers. If Telegram were to adopt end-to-end encryption, this cross-platform functionality would no longer be feasible.

In addition to security concerns, there are other issues associated with Telegram. The messaging platform has faced criticism for its lack of content controls, leading to its suspension in Spain's High Court. Furthermore, there have been reports of Telegram being used as a platform for criminal activities. While it serves as a tool for communication for various individuals, including activists and campaigners, its association with organized crime is concerning.

Considering all these factors, it is advisable not to follow the advice of switching from WhatsApp to Telegram. Despite Telegram's marketing claims, this move is a step backward in terms of security and privacy. Users should prioritize platforms that offer default end-to-end encryption, such as WhatsApp, to ensure the confidentiality of their messages.

In conclusion, while WhatsApp's recent update brings exciting features, it is important to be cautious about certain functionalities. The decision to switch from WhatsApp to Telegram should be carefully evaluated, considering the security risks and privacy implications. By prioritizing secure messaging platforms, users can ensure that their conversations remain private and protected.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65b41420a2b346798e66d370/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2207,1442,x681,y315,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 23:45:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/24/meet-the-apps-that-tell-you-when-to-take-your-eclipse-glasses-off/,Meet The Apps That Tell You When To Take Your Eclipse Glasses Off,"When it comes to knowing when to remove your solar eclipse glasses, it can be a bit confusing. But fear not, as I am here to provide you with some guidance. First and foremost, you need to make sure that you are within the path of totality, which is a narrow strip that spans only 115 miles wide. Secondly, you must find a spot with a clear sky. And lastly, the crucial moment comes when you need to take off your eclipse glasses to witness the sun's majestic corona.

Now, I understand that this final step can cause some panic among those who are eager to witness this spectacular event. But let me assure you, it's actually quite simple. You remove your eclipse glasses when it gets dark. Yes, that's it! If you are lucky enough to be in the path of totality, you will notice that it gets very dark very quickly as the moon's shadow passes over you. Trust me, you won't miss this moment. However, if you are not within the path of totality, it will not get dark, so you should keep your glasses on.

Now, here's where things get interesting. There are now smartphone apps available that offer an immersive audio experience during a solar eclipse. These apps not only provide instructions for when to remove your eclipse glasses as totality begins, but they also guide you through other fascinating phenomena to look out for. For example, they might tell you about shadow bands, which are wavy lines on the ground caused by Earth's turbulent atmosphere when the sun is a tiny crescent. They might also mention Baily's beads, which are the last few drops of sunlight, and the diamond ring effect, which appears like a jewel right before the corona becomes visible.

Since these apps heavily rely on audio instructions and narration, it is recommended to use them with earphones. However, instead of using earbuds that block out the sounds around you, opt for over-the-ear bone conduction earphones. This way, you can still be aware of your surroundings while enjoying the immersive experience.

Let's take a look at some of the top solar eclipse apps available:

1. The Eclipse Company (Platforms: iOS and Android)
The Eclipse Company offers a ""Pro"" version of their app, which provides users with real-time weather updates, cloud forecasts for totality, and a countdown timer with a vibration alert to safely remove your solar eclipse glasses. It also offers detailed information about local eclipse events and alerts users when to look for specific eclipse phenomena. This app creates an immersive audio experience but remains silent during totality.

2. Solar Eclipse Timer App (Platforms: iOS and Android)
Developed by eclipse chaser and educator Gordon Telepun, the Solar Eclipse Timer app is a great choice, especially for photographers. It geolocates your position, confirms whether you are within the path of totality, and guides you through the contact times. It also provides instructions for observing the various eclipse phenomena. The app even includes a new ""Photographer's Mode"" developed in collaboration with ex-NASA eclipse calculator and photographer Fred Espenak, also known as ""Mr. Eclipse.""

3. One Eclipse (Platform: iOS only)
One Eclipse is a unique app created by the non-profit organization Astronomers Without Borders and Simulation Curriculum, the makers of the SkySafari planetarium app. This app not only allows you to simulate the eclipse from your location or anywhere on Earth but also supports a recycling program for eclipse glasses in underserved communities worldwide. It features an interactive map with precise eclipse event times and a dynamic Eclipse Countdown clock. Additionally, it includes a simple audio timer for all the different phases of the eclipse.

So there you have it, three fantastic apps that can enhance your solar eclipse experience. But remember, always prioritize safety and protect your eyes by using certified solar eclipse glasses.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/25/google-upgrade-samsung-s24-s23-pixel-towards-apple-iphone-15-pro-max/,Google Suddenly Reveals Surprise Android Update That Beats iPhone,"Android and iPhone are in a fierce battle for users, and Google is determined to make Android more like iPhone. In its latest update, Google has introduced a feature that not only matches an existing iPhone feature but surpasses it. This is a significant development that puts Google ahead of Apple in certain aspects.

One of the key features of this update is the inclusion of an emergency satellite service. Android users will finally have access to the same satellite SOS functionality that iPhone users have had for a few years. This is a major step forward in terms of safety and security. Additionally, Google's offering includes a Garmin rescue service, further enhancing the user experience.

One limitation of Apple's emergency SOS feature is that it is only meant for emergencies. It displays an SOS tag on the screen when users are out of coverage, but it is not something that everyday users find useful. With the latest Android 15 developer preview, Google is addressing this issue by allowing users to expand their cellular accounts to include a satellite add-on. Core messaging apps will also be able to utilize the satellite network, eliminating cellular black spots and ensuring uninterrupted connectivity.

According to Mishaal Rahman, Android 15 DP2 introduces UI elements to ensure a consistent user experience for devices that support satellite connectivity. The update also includes a new API that apps can use to detect when a device is connected to a satellite. This opens up possibilities for SMS/MMS/RCS apps to use satellite connectivity for sending and receiving messages.

Apple's satellite connectivity options are more limited compared to Android. With certain iPhone models, users can connect to a satellite to text emergency services, request roadside assistance, and share their location with friends and family when they are off the grid with no mobile or Wi-Fi coverage.

There were hopes that Android would go even further, with beta code suggesting a satellite messaging option in partnership with T-Mobile. Elon Musk's announcement of SpaceX achieving download speeds of 17mbps to an unmodified Galaxy S21 Ultra further fueled speculation about the potential for direct phone satellite connectivity.

While direct phone satellite connectivity may be a future possibility, the integration of messaging is a significant step forward for now. It is confirmed that this feature will be available in Android 15, unless there are major changes. As Android and iPhone continue to converge, it appears that Google is taking the lead, with Apple likely to follow suit.

In other news, there have been reports that Gemini, an AI technology, may be coming to Apple's iPhone and powering some or many of iOS 18's AI updates. This development not only closes the gap between Android and iPhone but also enhances Google's role within the iPhone ecosystem.

Overall, these recent updates highlight the ongoing competition between Android and iPhone. Android is moving at a faster pace, introducing innovative features that match or surpass those of iPhone. The future looks promising for both operating systems as they continue to push boundaries and improve the user experience.

[Conclusion]
In conclusion, Google's latest update for Android brings exciting new features that rival and even surpass those of iPhone. The inclusion of an emergency satellite service is a significant step forward for user safety and security. Android users will now have access to the same functionality that iPhone users have had for a few years, along with the added bonus of a Garmin rescue service.

Moreover, the update allows users to expand their cellular accounts to include a satellite add-on, eliminating cellular black spots and ensuring uninterrupted connectivity. Messaging apps will also be able to utilize satellite connectivity, further enhancing the user experience.

While Apple's satellite connectivity options are more limited, there are reports that Gemini, an AI technology, may be coming to iPhone and powering AI updates in iOS 18. This not only closes the gap between Android and iPhone but also strengthens Google's presence within the iPhone ecosystem.

North America is currently experiencing a golden age of eclipses, and this week marks a significant moment leading up to a major event next week. In the early hours of Monday, March 25, the full worm moon will be partially eclipsed by Earth, resulting in a penumbral lunar eclipse. Although it won't be a full ""blood moon"" total lunar eclipse, this event is crucial because it sets the stage for a total solar eclipse on Monday, April 8, 2024. To ensure you don't miss out on this awe-inspiring phenomenon, here are some planning tips.

Apart from the lunar eclipse, there are other celestial highlights to look out for this week. As the waning gibbous moon rises later each night, it will pass close to a couple of bright stars, making the early evening skies perfect for stargazing by the weekend. Now, let's dive into the details of what you can expect in the night sky this week.

Monday, March 25: 'Worm Moon Lunar Eclipse'

On Monday, March 25, the ""Worm Moon,"" also known as the ""Crow Moon"" and the ""Lenten Moon,"" will be in the Earth's outer shadow, resulting in a penumbral lunar eclipse. This eclipse will be visible on the night side of Earth, including North and South America, Europe, East Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. In New York, the eclipse will begin at 00:53 a.m. EDT and end at 05:32 a.m. EDT, with the maximum eclipse occurring at 03:12 a.m. EDT. In Los Angeles, the eclipse will start at 9:53 p.m. PDT on Sunday, March 24, and end at 02:32 a.m. PDT on Monday, March 25, with the maximum eclipse at 00:12 a.m. EDT.

Tuesday, March 26: Moon And Spica

A few hours after sunset on Tuesday, March 26, you'll witness an almost full moon rising due east. However, what makes this moonrise special is the presence of the bright star Spica, located just to the top right of the rising moon. Spica is the brightest star in the constellation Virgo and one of the 20 brightest stars in the night sky. It will be within 1.4 degrees of our natural satellite, creating a captivating celestial sight.

Saturday, March 30: Moon And Antares

If you're up late on Friday into the early hours of Saturday, look towards the southeast, and you'll spot a 78%-lit waning gibbous moon less than a degree from Antares. Antares is a red supergiant star in the constellation Scorpius. Witnessing the proximity between the moon and Antares will be a treat for stargazers.

Galaxies Of The Week: Bode’s And The Cigar

Ursa Minor and Ursa Major, visible in the northern sky after dark this week, are home to two galaxies that are a sight to behold through an 8-inch telescope. M81, also known as Bode’s galaxy, is a large spiral galaxy situated approximately 12 million light-years away from Earth. It is one of the brightest galaxies in the night sky. On the other hand, M82, referred to as the Cigar galaxy, is a starburst galaxy also located about 12 million light-years from Earth. It is known for its high rate of star formation. In a telescope's field of view, you can observe small, diffuse patches of light northwest of the bright star Dubhe in the Big Dipper.

Eclipse Tip Of The Week: Preparing For The Total Solar Eclipse

Less than two weeks remain until one of the rarest and most stunning celestial events graces North America—a total solar eclipse. If you haven't made solid plans yet, it's time to act. Remember, you must position yourself within the path of totality (the yellow stripe on the map) to fully experience the eclipse. Getting close to the path won't make a significant difference. To find out where to stay and where to witness the eclipse, you can refer to various articles on my feed or visit websites that offer maps, simulations, and event listings. Make sure to check online planetariums like Stellarium and The Sky Live for the most accurate location-specific information regarding planet-rise/planet-set, sunrise/sunset, and moonrise/moonset times.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/techcrunch-mobility-the-wheels-are-starting-to-come-off-the-fisker-ev-bus/,TechCrunch Mobility: The wheels are starting to come off the Fisker EV bus,"Welcome to TechCrunch Mobility, your go-to source for all things transportation. In this edition, we'll be diving into the latest news and updates in the world of mobility. But before we get started, let's take a moment to discuss some recent developments on Capitol Hill.

The Biden Administration has introduced two new proposed standards that will have a significant impact on U.S. automakers and consumers alike. These regulations, released by the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), aim to enforce stricter standards than ever before.

The DOE's proposal includes a ""petroleum equivalency factor"" that assigns a score to electric vehicles (EVs) under the government's corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. The original proposal would have posed challenges for automakers to meet these standards, resulting in substantial fines. However, the revised version offers a more lenient approach.

On the other hand, the EPA's proposal outlines tailpipe standards for model year cars and light-duty trucks from 2027 to 2032. While these requirements are more demanding for automakers, they allow for flexibility in meeting the rules through various powertrains. The standards are also technology agnostic, meaning they can be met without a complete shift to battery electric vehicles (EVs).

Although these regulations have minimal impact on EV startups like Rivian, Tesla, and Lucid, they have significant implications for legacy automakers. While these companies are investing billions in EV development, they still rely on profits from internal combustion engine vehicles. Plug-in hybrids could be the winners in this scenario.

Now, let's move on to the latest news in the mobility space. One interesting development involves Clevon, a company that specializes in autonomous delivery technology. Despite facing challenges in securing new investments, Clevon has managed to stay afloat. The company recently entered into an exclusivity agreement for a merger with an American electric vehicle company, which is expected to be finalized by June.

In other news, Uber has made its first investment in an Africa-founded startup. Moove, a mobility fintech company, raised $100 million in a Series B funding round led by Uber. Moove offers vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers and is valued at $750 million. This investment aligns with Uber's commitment to achieving a fully zero-emission fleet by 2040.

Additionally, Amber, a Bay Area startup, raised $3.18 million in a seed round for its aftermarket Tesla extended warranty product. Candela, an electric boat maker, secured $25 million in funding led by Groupe Beneteau. And Pelikan Mobility, a French startup, unveiled its electric scooter-sharing service in Paris.

That wraps up this week's edition of TechCrunch Mobility. Stay tuned for more exciting updates in the world of transportation.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1363022906.jpg?resize=1200,730",2024-03-24 19:00:33,Innovation,Innovation

It's Monday, and another week is upon us. Can you believe it's already the last week of March? Time truly flies, especially when you're having fun with puzzle games!

This past weekend was quite unusual. Just as we were welcoming the lovely spring weather, a surprise snowstorm hit and covered everything in half a foot of snow. It's cold and wintry, but I can't deny that the snowy landscape has its own charm.

But enough about the weather, let's get back to work and dive into today's Wordle challenge! Here's how you can solve it:

The Hint: Normally, we associate this phrase as a proper noun.

The Clue: Today's Wordle contains a double letter.

Now, let's move on to the spoilers!

The Answer:
Can you crack the code and solve today's phrase? Play Now!

Wordle Analysis:
I must admit, today's Wordle had me stumped for a while. I started off with a whopping 195 possible solutions after my first attempt. Even after narrowing it down to 40 with the word ""boink,"" I was still struggling.

However, the word ""allay"" turned out to be a fortunate guess. It revealed that there was more than one ""L,"" which left me with just one word left to find. Initially, I almost guessed ""palsy"" but quickly realized I needed a second ""L."" After some brainstorming, I finally settled on ""sally,"" which is often associated with a name but also refers to an old battle tactic.

Competitive Wordle Score:
Unfortunately, no points for me this time. Guessing in four attempts or tying with the Wordle Bot didn't earn me any points. It's a big, fat zero for now.

The Etymology Behind Today's Wordle:
In its non-proper noun context, the word ""sally"" primarily means to suddenly rush forth or launch a surprise attack from a defensive position. It can also signify embarking on a journey or a new venture. The etymology of ""sally"" in this sense is quite fascinating, tracing its roots through multiple languages before arriving in English.

The term originated from Middle French as ""sallie,"" the noun form of ""sallir,"" which means ""to rush out"" or ""leap forth."" ""Sallir"" itself can be traced back to the Latin word ""salire,"" which means ""to leap."" This Latin root has given rise to various related words in English, such as ""salient"" (prominently projecting) and ""assail"" (to attack). These words reflect the concept of movement or leaping forth.

Therefore, the etymology of ""sally"" captures the essence of moving out or leaping forth, often with a sense of suddenness or unexpectedness. It can refer to a physical attack from a fortified position or embarking on a journey or new venture.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewwight/2024/03/24/helping-patients-access-sickle-cell-disease-treatments-in-west-africa/,Helping Patients Access Sickle Cell Disease Treatments In West Africa,"A researcher from Cameroon is on a mission to help patients in low-income countries in West Africa afford the medicine they need for sickle cell disease. With over 4 million people worldwide affected by sickle cell disease, 80% of cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa, and 89% of women in central and west Africa lack access to universal medical coverage.

Dr. Marthe-Sandrine Eiymo Mwa Mpollo, a scientist and co-founder of NaYa Health, realized that simply having a drug for sickle cell disease is not enough for patients. Affordability is key. ""Without access, research fails to deliver the promise for so many in the Global South,"" she explains. This realization inspired the founding of NaYa Health, a digital patient assistance platform that aims to help underserved patients without insurance have timely access to medication, even when they are short of cash.

Through community savings, deferred payments, and a portable health-only savings account, NaYa Health provides a solution to manage health risks and safeguard earnings. In a pilot implementation in Cameroon's capital, NaYa Health has boosted the ability of informal workers to handle unexpected challenges, increased income for local medical providers, and guaranteed access to critical services.

NaYa Health's efforts have not gone unnoticed. The company was selected in the financial inclusion challenge by MIT Solve, further validating their work in improving access to medication for patients with sickle cell disease.

Dr. Mpollo's passion for medicine in Cameroon stems from her childhood, where she watched ""doctors without borders"" shows that highlighted the impact of diseases like sickle cell disease on the quality of life of affected individuals and their families. This exposure ignited her desire to bring healthcare to challenged communities. Though her initial goal was to become a medical doctor, her journey led her to life science research in Canada and the US, where she obtained a doctorate from the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Cincinnati. Her focus was on developing therapies for sickle cell disease, a genetic disease that disproportionately affects individuals of African descent.

After publishing scientific papers on the mechanism causing lung damage in sickle cell patients and communicating her research findings, Dr. Mpollo realized that access to medication is crucial for research to realize its full life-saving potential. This realization led to the launch of NaYa Health. She emphasizes that scientists from the Global South have a unique perspective on the limitations of their settings, particularly regarding affordability, access, and cultural acceptance of research findings. By tailoring research to the specific needs of their communities, scientists from the Global South can better address healthcare issues and work with local actors to distribute scientific findings effectively.

In Zambia, another team of entrepreneurs, researchers, and health professionals is leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to improve care for pregnant women. Despite a significant decrease in Zambia's death rate for pregnant mothers between 2000 and 2017, there is still a 1% risk of maternal mortality. Tafadzwa Kalisto Munzwa, founder and CEO of Dawa Health, based in Lusaka, Zambia, has developed the DawaMom project to address this issue.

DawaMom utilizes AI tools, last-mile health workers, mobile clinics, and digital tools to improve maternal and child health. Over 60 community health workers are supporting in-community healthcare through DawaMom, and more than 800 mothers have signed up on the mobile platform. The generative AI models used in DawaMom are patient-facing and respond to patient inquiries, providing accurate and personalized information.

The efforts of NaYa Health and Dawa Health demonstrate the power of innovation and technology in addressing healthcare challenges in low-income countries. By focusing on affordability, access, and tailored solutions, these organizations are making a significant impact on the lives of patients and their communities. Through their work, they are bringing hope and improving the quality of healthcare for those who need it most.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66009a73668df974c31e0a4f/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=579,579,x127,y431,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 17:54:08,Innovation,Innovation
