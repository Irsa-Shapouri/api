https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/mallard-bay-airbnb-for-guided-hunting-and-fishing/,Mallard Bay is the Airbnb for guided hunting and fishing,"Americans spent over $144.8 billion on fishing and hunting in 2022, as reported by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. One significant aspect of this industry is guided hunting and fishing excursions, traditionally booked offline via phone calls and paid for with physical checks or cash. Mallard Bay, a Houston-based startup, aims to revolutionize this process.

Mallard Bay serves as a marketplace for hunting and fishing enthusiasts to easily discover and book guided tours online, akin to booking a hotel. Additionally, the platform functions as a vertical SaaS solution for outfitters, enabling them to digitize their operations and offer services like marketing assistance.

Recently, Mallard Bay secured a $4.6 million Series A funding round led by Soul Venture Partners, with participation from Acadian Capital Ventures and other angel investors. Co-founder and CEO Logan Meaux conceived the idea for the company following a disappointing hunting trip with his father, where they encountered double booking issues and subpar experiences. This setback inspired Meaux to create a more efficient and reliable platform for booking outdoor excursions.

Initially envisioned as a marketplace similar to Airbnb, Mallard Bay evolved its offering based on feedback from outfitters. This led to the development of Guidetech, Mallard Bay's comprehensive back office solution tailored for outfitters' needs. By bridging the gap between technology and outdoor enthusiasts, Mallard Bay has successfully onboarded influencers like Toby Brohlin, contributing to over $6 million in gross bookings in 2023.

Despite facing challenges in garnering investor interest, Mallard Bay's focus on ethical hunting practices and conservation efforts has set it apart in the industry. Meaux emphasizes the importance of sustainable wildlife management and ethical hunting practices as integral to the company's mission.

While hunting and fishing may seem like niche markets, the growth and potential within these industries are substantial. Mallard Bay's impressive 600% year-over-year booking growth highlights the untapped opportunities in this sector. As outdoor activities continue to gain popularity, there is a growing need for innovative solutions like Mallard Bay to streamline the booking process and enhance the overall experience for enthusiasts.

In a world where outdoor activities like hunting, fishing, hiking, and birdwatching contribute significantly to the economy, embracing technology and digitization is crucial. Mallard Bay's success serves as a testament to the potential of niche markets and the impact of leveraging technology to enhance traditional industries. By bridging the gap between outdoor enthusiasts and outfitters, Mallard Bay is paving the way for a more seamless and efficient booking experience in the world of guided hunting and fishing excursions.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/greysen-johnson-cZVzzFadTMc-unsplash.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-23 16:00:34
https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2024/03/23/apple-iphone-16-pro-ios-18-ai-china-baidu-google-gemini/,Apple’s Latest AI Move Is Vital To Find iPhone Success,"As Apple gears up to unveil its AI strategy for the iPhone, a potential collaboration with Google is on the horizon, accompanied by a possible partnership with China's Baidu.

While Android devices have been showcasing generative AI in their flagship launches, Apple's iPhone 15 series has lagged behind in this aspect. Despite AI being integrated into software functionalities like image processing and predictive text input, generative AI is slated for introduction in the upcoming iOS update. Anticipated to debut at the Worldwide Developer Conference this summer, iOS 18 will be featured on the next-gen iPhone 16 lineup.

Apple, like other smartphone manufacturers, will emphasize both on-device and cloud-based AI processing. CEO Tim Cook and his team are likely to capitalize on Apple's reputation for prioritizing on-device data storage for local processing. However, cloud utilization will be necessary for AI applications demanding extensive processing capabilities.

Reports suggest that Apple is in talks with Google to utilize its Gemini generative AI service for cloud processing needs. Despite Google's association with the Android OS, the two tech giants collaborate on various fronts, including Google being the default search engine on Apple devices. Google stands to benefit from the vast user base of AI-enabled iPhone users that Apple can potentially bring, particularly as Google strives to establish its AI ecosystem amidst competition from rivals like OpenAI.

Given restrictions in China, including stringent regulations and government scrutiny, Google's Gemini service is not accessible in the region. Consequently, Apple is exploring a collaboration with China's Baidu to incorporate its cloud-based AI services into iOS 18 and the iPhone 16 lineup.

Apple is not the sole player pursuing such partnerships. Samsung recently unveiled the Galaxy S24 series and Galaxy AI services at Galaxy Unpacked, with some components leveraging Google Gemini. To cater to the Chinese market, Samsung has turned to Baidu for AI solutions.

It remains to be seen how Apple will differentiate its AI offerings from competitors, especially when leveraging similar technology foundations.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/23/google-upgrade-samsung-s24-s23-pixel-towards-apple-iphone-15-pro-max/,Google Suddenly Reveals Surprise Android Update That Beats iPhone,"Android and iPhone are now closer than ever, with both operating systems and their respective handsets offering similar features. Google, in particular, seems to be taking the lead in innovation, as it has recently introduced a groundbreaking new feature that is set to debut on Android before making its way to Apple devices.

In its ongoing effort to align Android with iPhone standards, Google has been making significant strides in improving Android security, integrating popular apps like WhatsApp into its phone dialer, and even incorporating Apple passes into its wallet. The latest update from Google not only matches an existing iPhone feature but also surpasses it, demonstrating Google's ability to outpace Apple in certain aspects.

One notable feature that Google has introduced is an emergency satellite service, which brings Android on par with Apple's satellite SOS functionality. This new service enhances user safety and security by providing access to a readymade Garmin rescue service, a significant advancement for Android users.

Unlike Apple's emergency SOS feature, which is primarily geared towards extreme situations, Google's satellite connectivity offers a more versatile solution. With the latest Android 15 developer preview, users can now expand their cellular accounts to include a satellite add-on, allowing core messaging apps to utilize the satellite network for improved connectivity in areas with poor cellular coverage.

According to Mishaal Rahman, Android 15 introduces new UI elements and APIs to support satellite connectivity, enabling messaging apps to send and receive messages via satellite. This development opens up possibilities for network providers to offer LEO satellite connectivity as an account option, enhancing communication capabilities for users.

While Apple also offers satellite connectivity on select iPhone models, Google's approach appears to be more expansive and forward-thinking. The potential for direct-to-phone satellite connectivity, as demonstrated by Elon Musk's SpaceX achieving high download speeds on a Samsung device, hints at a future where satellite communication becomes more accessible.

In addition to messaging integration, Android's focus on satellite connectivity showcases Google's commitment to advancing mobile technology. As Android and iPhone continue to converge in terms of features and capabilities, Google's proactive approach in introducing innovative features like satellite messaging sets a new standard for the industry.

The latest updates on Google's satellite messaging plans coincide with reports of Gemini, Google's AI technology, potentially coming to Apple's iPhone. This development not only signals a closer integration between Google and Apple ecosystems but also highlights Android's agility in implementing cutting-edge technologies on mobile devices.

Overall, the evolving landscape of Android versus iPhone competition underscores the rapid pace of innovation in the smartphone industry. As Google continues to lead with groundbreaking features, the gap between Android and iPhone narrows, setting the stage for a future where mobile technology knows no bounds.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65d79ec3dadcd6b682668331/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-23 19:17:25

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/23/explained-the-difference-between-a-solar-eclipse-and-a-lunar-eclipse/,Explained: The Difference Between A Solar Eclipse And A Lunar Eclipse,"Do you know the distinction between a solar eclipse and a lunar eclipse? In the upcoming weeks, we will witness two celestial events—a lunar eclipse on Monday, March 25, and a solar eclipse on Monday, April 8. Despite their differences, both phenomena are a result of the same celestial alignment.

A lunar eclipse occurs when Earth's shadow falls upon the moon, while a solar eclipse takes place when the moon obstructs the sun's light and creates a shadow on Earth. However, these eclipses are infrequent due to the slight variation in the orbital planes of the Earth and the moon around the sun.

So, what causes a lunar eclipse? This phenomenon can only happen during a full moon, when Earth is positioned between the sun and the moon, casting a shadow into space. Although full moons occur every 29 days, it is rare for the moon to pass through Earth's shadow. When it does align, a lunar eclipse occurs.

On the other hand, a solar eclipse can only occur during a new moon, when the moon is situated between the sun and Earth, resulting in a shadow being projected onto Earth. New moons take place every 29 days, approximately two weeks after a full moon. However, it is uncommon for the moon to block the sun as seen from Earth. When this does happen, it signifies a solar eclipse.

During a total lunar eclipse, a perfect alignment of the sun, Earth, and moon transpires. Earth possesses two shadows—the outer penumbral shadow and the inner umbral shadow. When the moon enters Earth's umbral shadow, it is deprived of direct sunlight. Instead, the moon's surface is illuminated by sunlight refracted by Earth's atmosphere. Consequently, the lunar surface takes on a pinkish-red hue, creating the captivating phenomenon known as a ""Blood Moon."" If one were to stand on the moon during a lunar eclipse, they would be immersed in a pinkish-red glow and witness a partial or total solar eclipse.

On March 25, a penumbral lunar eclipse will occur as the full ""Worm Moon"" traverses Earth's penumbra.

In the case of a total solar eclipse, a perfect alignment of the sun, moon, and Earth, combined with a celestial fluke, is responsible for this phenomenon. A new moon possesses two shadows—the outer penumbral shadow and the inner umbral shadow. When the new moon perfectly blocks the sun, it does so due to its size, which is 400 times smaller than the sun, but also because it is 400 times closer to Earth. As a result, the moon's umbra is projected onto Earth.

Since the moon orbits from west to east, the shadow moves across Earth's surface. This movement is in the same direction as Earth's rotation, causing the moon's shadow to slow down. Consequently, an umbral shadow, or path of totality, is created. Within this path, observers are treated to a remarkable sight—a total solar eclipse. If one were standing on the moon during a total solar eclipse, they would witness the moon's shadow crossing Earth.

On April 8, a total solar eclipse will occur as the new ""Pink Moon"" perfectly blocks the sun, projecting an umbral shadow over North America.

Lunar and solar eclipses are rare occurrences due to the moon's orbit around Earth being tilted approximately 5 degrees with respect to the sun's path through the sky. As a result, the moon's path intersects with the sun twice during each orbit, which happens monthly. However, for an eclipse to occur, the moon must be in its new or full phase. This alignment occurs twice a year, resulting in two ""eclipse seasons"" when both lunar and solar eclipses are guaranteed. However, most solar eclipses are either partial or annular, while most lunar eclipses are penumbral or partial.

In 2024, we can look forward to two eclipse seasons commencing on March 25 and September 17. During these seasons, the following eclipses will occur in North America:

March 25, 2024: Penumbral lunar eclipse
April 8, 2024: Total solar eclipse
September 17, 2024: Partial lunar eclipse
October 2, 2024: Annular solar eclipse

As for 2025, two eclipse seasons will take place, starting on March 13 and September 7. The eclipses during these seasons will be visible in various regions:

March 13, 2025: Total lunar eclipse (visible in North America)
March 29, 2025: Partial solar eclipse (visible in Canada and northern Europe)
September 7, 2025: Total lunar eclipse (visible in Asia)
September 21, 2025: Partial solar eclipse (visible in Antarctica)

The bite, which resulted in Severino's disqualification, occurred while he was in a standing grappling position behind Lima. Images clearly showed the bite marks, leading to immediate repercussions for Severino.

Despite being only 20 years old, Severino's actions have jeopardized his future in the UFC. The loss marked the first defeat of his career, bringing his record to 9-1, while Lima maintained his undefeated status at 8-0.

Following the incident, UFC CEO Dana White swiftly made the decision to cut Severino from the promotion. White emphasized the severity of the situation, stating that there are better ways to handle frustrations in a fight than resorting to biting.

Biting in combat sports is a reprehensible act, and Severino will need to rebuild his reputation in smaller promotions before considering a return to prominent MMA organizations like the UFC or Professional Fighters League.

But before we dive into that, let me share a little confession. I've always had this desire to make rabbit pot pies on Easter. There's something about the irony of it that would perfectly complement the savory dish. Maybe one year I'll actually do it. But for now, let's focus on Wordle.

For those who are new to the game, Wordle is a fun word puzzle that has gained quite a following. If you're looking for hints, clues, and answers for today's Wordle, you've come to the right place. But before we get to that, I want to mention that I've been writing Strands guides for some weeks now, and it's another word puzzle game that I highly recommend. You can check out today's Strands guide on my blog.

Now, let's get down to business and solve today's Wordle puzzle. Here's the hint: it's useful when dry, but useless when wet. And the clue is that today's Wordle begins with a consonant. Spoiler alert! If you want to figure it out on your own, stop reading here.

The answer is... ""towel""! Can you believe it? I must admit, my initial guess was way off. I went with ""chain,"" which turned out to be a 681-word disaster. But then I thought of ""slope,"" and that brought the number down to a more manageable 19. Eventually, I settled on ""below"" because it just felt right. And guess what? It was! I even managed to come up with a few more words thanks to today's Strands puzzle, one of which was ""towel."" How funny is that? Could it be a mere coincidence? Hmmm...

Well, my attempt at the Wordle puzzle may not have been a success, but that's okay. Sometimes we win, and sometimes we lose. It's all part of the fun. And speaking of fun, let's take a moment to explore the etymology of the word ""towel.""

Did you know that the word ""towel"" can be traced back to the Old French term ""touaille""? This term made its way into the English language around the 13th century. It is believed that ""touaille"" originated from the Medieval Latin term ""tovaglia,"" which may have come from the Latin word ""tubicula,"" a diminutive form of ""tuba,"" meaning ""tube"" or ""cloth.""

The evolution of the word ""towel"" showcases the linguistic influences of Norman French on the English language following the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. Over time, many words of French origin underwent pronunciation and spelling changes as they were Anglicized. This is how we ended up with the modern English word ""towel."" Throughout the centuries, towels have been an essential item in households, evolving in material and usage, but always serving the same purpose: drying or wiping.

And that concludes our journey through today's Wordle puzzle and the fascinating history of towels. I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.

Let's dive right in!

The U.S. has joined international regulators in accusing Apple of using monopolistic tactics to lock in iPhone users. In response, Apple claims that the actions taken by the Department of Justice (DOJ) could potentially ruin what its users enjoy about its phones and ecosystem.

The lawsuit filed by the DOJ draws a comparison between Apple and Microsoft in the 1990s, although there are notable differences between the two companies and their efforts to retain customers.

However, experts predict that there won't be significant developments in the lawsuit in the short-term. It could take three to five years for the case to reach a resolution.

Moving on to other news, Microsoft has acquired the co-founders of Inflection AI, a prominent AI startup. Mustafa Suleyman will now lead Microsoft AI's consumer-facing unit, while Karén Simonyan has been appointed as the EVP and CEO of the same group. Inflection AI had previously raised $1.3 billion, with Microsoft being the largest investor.

Nvidia made some surprising announcements at their GTC developer conference. CEO Jensen Huang predicted that artificial general intelligence would be achievable within the next five years. They also unveiled a new AI platform called GR00T, designed for humanoid robots.

Meanwhile, Google and Apple are reportedly in talks to deploy Google's AI model to power upcoming iOS updates. Whether this will be a temporary solution until Apple's own AI efforts catch up, a long-term partnership, or a negotiation that never materializes remains to be seen.

In the realm of hacking and privacy, the Biden administration is forming an international coalition to combat commercial spyware. Interestingly, some investors involved in this coalition were previously connected to the very business they are now fighting against.

Additionally, a recent hack disrupted a $5 million Apex Legends tournament, with the intention of exposing the exploit used and raising awareness among developers. Users of Glassdoor, the popular job review platform, have reported that their real names are being added to their profiles without their consent, leaving them with no option but to delete their accounts.

Turning to funding and IPOs, Reddit's IPO had a strong start, with the stock jumping 48% on its first day of trading. Astera Labs, a company specializing in connectivity hardware for cloud computing data centers, also experienced success, with its stock closing at $62.03 on day one.

The Browser Company, the startup behind the Arc browser, raised $50 million at a valuation of $550 million. While the company has launched several features and AI updates, its path to monetization remains unclear.

In our bonus round, we explore why AI often struggles with spelling, despite its immense potential. We also highlight Fisker's production pause, which is not due to issues with their electric vehicles but rather a lack of capital that may lead to the company shutting down.

In conclusion, while it may be impossible to review systems like ChatGPT or Gemini fully, it is crucial to put them to the test despite their inherent challenges.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/anuradhavaranasi/2024/03/24/which-adhd-medications-could-lower-risk-of-suicide--hospitalization/,Which ADHD Medications Could Lower Risk Of Suicide & Hospitalization?,"ADHD Medications Linked to Lower Risk of Suicide and Psychiatric Hospitalization, Study Finds

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects both adults and adolescents. A recent study conducted by researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, has found a significant association between the use of ADHD stimulant medications and a reduced risk of suicide attempts, as well as a decrease in psychiatric hospitalizations.

The study, which included a sample size of 221,714 individuals diagnosed with ADHD, examined the effects of four ADHD medications on suicidal behavior and hospitalization rates. The medications analyzed were amphetamine, lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate. The findings revealed that all four medications were linked to a decreased risk of hospitalization due to psychiatric co-morbidities. However, when it came to suicidal behavior, only lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate showed a significant association.

It is worth noting that a previous study conducted in 2019 in Sweden found that individuals with ADHD are more likely to have psychiatric co-morbidities compared to those without the disorder. The prevalence of psychiatric co-morbidity among individuals with ADHD was found to be 52%, while the prevalence among those without ADHD was only 7%. Psychiatric co-morbidities include conditions such as major depressive disorder, panic disorder, substance abuse, generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, PTSD, and psychotic symptoms. The presence of psychiatric co-morbidities was also found to increase the risk of mortality, particularly when substance use disorder was involved.

The researchers emphasized the importance of ADHD medications in improving overall functioning and quality of life, in addition to alleviating the core symptoms of ADHD. However, they also acknowledged the need for further research on the long-term effectiveness and safety of these medications. While stimulants, such as ADHD medications, have been associated with beneficial psychiatric outcomes, such as a decreased risk of depression and suicide, there are concerns about potential adverse effects, including the risk of psychosis and cardiovascular diseases.

To conduct the study, the researchers analyzed healthcare data from the Swedish National Patient Register, focusing on individuals between the ages of 16 and 65 who had received an ADHD diagnosis between 2006 and 2021. They also tracked the purchase of prescribed ADHD medications using data from the Prescribed Drug Register. The most commonly used medication among the study participants was methylphenidate, followed by lisdexamphetamine and atomoxetine.

The study participants were followed for a period of 15 years, during which 56% of them experienced psychiatric co-morbidities, with anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and stress-related disorders being the most common. Approximately 26% of the participants had been hospitalized due to psychiatric co-morbidities.

Interestingly, the study found that the effectiveness of certain medications varied among different age groups and genders. Lisdexamphetamine was associated with a decreased risk of psychiatric hospitalization across all age groups, while methylphenidate seemed to be less effective in older adults. Atomoxetine, on the other hand, was linked to a decreased risk of hospitalization among women but not men.

Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the potential benefits of ADHD medications in reducing the risk of suicide and psychiatric hospitalization. However, further research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects and potential risks associated with these medications. It is important for healthcare professionals to consider the individual needs and characteristics of each patient when prescribing ADHD medications and to closely monitor their response to treatment.

The findings of this study contribute to the growing body of knowledge surrounding ADHD and highlight the importance of early diagnosis, appropriate treatment, and ongoing support for individuals with the disorder. By addressing the underlying neurobiological factors and providing effective interventions, it is possible to improve the lives of those affected by ADHD and reduce the associated risks.

In conclusion, the study underscores the potential benefits of ADHD medications in reducing the risk of suicide attempts and psychiatric hospitalizations. However, further research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects and potential risks associated with these medications. It is crucial for healthcare professionals to consider the individual needs of each patient and closely monitor their response to treatment. By doing so, we can provide the necessary support and interventions to improve the lives of individuals with ADHD.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/63c28dbb82c31b7412c92cf2/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 04:09:46

Liquid Death: Disrupting the Beverage Industry with a Fizzy Twist

In a world dominated by giants like Coke and Pepsi, a new wave of venture-backed beverage startups is making a splash. One such company is Liquid Death, a canned water company that recently announced a staggering $67 million funding round, valuing the company at $1.4 billion. With $263 million in sales in 2023, Liquid Death is proving that it's more than just a quirky brand with a catchy name.

What sets Liquid Death apart from other beverage startups is its ability to attract venture funding in an industry that doesn't typically interest investors. The beverage industry is capital intensive and requires a deep understanding of consumer preferences and retail strategies. However, Liquid Death's disruptive brand and better-for-you product have caught the attention of investors like Science Ventures.

Michael Jones, the managing director of Science Ventures, explained why his firm decided to back Liquid Death despite not being actively involved in the beverage sector. He saw the potential for Liquid Death to disrupt legacy players like Pepsi and Coke by offering a culturally relevant product in a tired and old category.

But Liquid Death is not the only startup looking to shake up the beverage industry. Many others are creating new drink categories and leveraging innovative marketing strategies to gain market share. Take Liquid Death's inspiration from the beer industry, for example. By emulating beer's marketing and shelf placement, Liquid Death has not only found success on grocery store shelves but also at events, bars, and restaurants. The company's unique branding and packaging have made it a hit among consumers looking for alcohol-inspired alternatives that are healthier and more socially acceptable.

Not Beer, another up-and-coming brand, is capitalizing on the trend of drinking less alcohol. Founder Dillon Dandurand is launching a premium sparkling water brand that appeals to consumers who still want to have fun without the need for excessive alcohol consumption. With Gen Z drinking less than previous generations, there is a growing market for non-alcoholic alternatives that offer a nice buzz without the negative effects of alcohol.

However, breaking through the noise in the beverage industry is no easy task. Consumers care about two main attributes: taste and branding. To stand out from the competition, brands must convince consumers that their drink is not only better than similar ones in the same category but also better than drinks in other categories. This presents a tough battle for startups like Not Beer and Liquid Death, but their unique value propositions give them a fighting chance.

Water may be the primary focus for many beverage startups, but there are other categories attracting attention and investment. Drinks infused with vitamins, minerals, supplements, and botanicals have become increasingly popular. Startups like Odyssey, which infuses lion's mane and cordyceps mushrooms known for their cognitive and energy-boosting effects, have raised significant venture capital. Similarly, better-for-you soda startups like Olipop and Poppi have seen success with their unique offerings and have raised over $50 million in funding.

The rise of healthier alternatives extends beyond the traditional soda market. Lemon Perfect, a healthy lemonade alternative, has raised over $70 million from a diverse group of investors, including VC firms, athletes, and celebrities like Beyoncé. Another player in the market, Poppi, has gained a significant market share since its launch four years ago, thanks to the support of celebrity investors like Russell Westbrook and Olivia Munn.

In a landscape dominated by industry giants, it's refreshing to see startups like Liquid Death and Not Beer disrupt the beverage industry with their innovative products and marketing strategies. As consumers become more conscious of their health and wellness, these startups are well-positioned to cater to their evolving preferences. With venture funding flowing in and sales on the rise, the future looks promising for these forward-thinking beverage startups.
