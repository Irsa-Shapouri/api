https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-co8322-sustainable-fuel.html,Research lights up process for turning CO₂ into sustainable fuel,"Researchers from the University of Nottingham, University of Birmingham, University of Queensland, and University of Ulm have made a breakthrough in the field of green fuels. They have successfully converted carbon dioxide (CO2) into methanol by using sunlight to activate single atoms of copper on a specially designed material. The findings of this study, which were published in the Sustainable Energy & Fuels journal, have significant implications for the development of sustainable energy sources.

The team of international researchers developed a material composed of copper atoms anchored on nanocrystalline carbon nitride. These copper atoms are embedded within the nanocrystalline structure, allowing for the transfer of electrons from carbon nitride to CO2. This transfer is a crucial step in the production of methanol from CO2 when exposed to solar irradiation.

Photocatalysis is a process in which light is directed at a semiconductor material, stimulating the movement of electrons and enabling them to react with CO2 and water to produce various useful products, including methanol. However, this process has historically suffered from efficiency and selectivity issues.

Carbon dioxide is a major contributor to global warming, making it imperative to find ways to convert it into useful products. Traditional methods of converting CO2 rely on hydrogen sourced from fossil fuels, which is not sustainable in the long term. Therefore, alternative methods based on photo- and electrocatalysis that utilize solar energy and readily available water are crucial.

Dr. Madasamy Thangamuthu, a research fellow at the University of Nottingham's School of Chemistry and one of the leaders of the research team, emphasized the importance of finding the right materials for photocatalysis. The photocatalyst must effectively absorb light and separate charge carriers to achieve high efficiency. The team's approach involves controlling the material at the nanoscale, utilizing a new form of carbon nitride with crystalline nanoscale domains that facilitate efficient interaction with light and charge separation.

To optimize the functional properties of carbon nitride for photocatalysis, the researchers heated it to a specific degree of crystallinity. They then used magnetron sputtering to deposit atomic copper onto the carbon nitride, ensuring close contact between the semiconductor and metal atoms.

The experimental results were promising. Even without the addition of copper, the new form of carbon nitride exhibited 44 times higher activity compared to traditional carbon nitride. However, the addition of just 1 mg of copper per 1 g of carbon nitride quadrupled the efficiency. Furthermore, the selectivity of the process shifted from producing methane, another greenhouse gas, to producing methanol, a valuable green fuel.

Professor Andrei Khlobystov, a member of the School of Chemistry at the University of Nottingham, highlighted the importance of sustainable catalyst materials in carbon dioxide valorization. The new catalyst developed by the team consists of carbon, nitrogen, and copper, all of which are abundant elements on Earth.

This breakthrough represents a significant advancement in understanding photocatalytic materials for CO2 conversion. It opens up possibilities for creating highly selective and adjustable catalysts that can be finely controlled at the nanoscale to produce desired products.

In conclusion, the research conducted by the international team of scientists has demonstrated the successful conversion of carbon dioxide into methanol using sunlight and copper atoms on a specially designed material. This breakthrough has the potential to revolutionize the production of green fuels and contribute to efforts in mitigating global warming. By utilizing sustainable elements and optimizing the nanoscale structure of the catalyst, the researchers have made significant strides in the field of photocatalysis for CO2 conversion. This study serves as a stepping stone towards a more sustainable and eco-friendly future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/research-lights-up-pro.jpg,2024-03-25 20:10:01,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2024/03/26/can-ai-amplify-esprit-de-corps/,Can AI Amplify Esprit De Corps?,"Can AI bring us together?

In the world of sports, the ""Moneyball"" approach of using data to make decisions has proven to be successful. However, as more teams adopt this approach, it's becoming harder to gain a competitive edge. Is there something else that can help teams rise to the top?

Back in the 1980s, Dr. Peter Senge studied the Los Angeles Lakers, one of the most successful basketball teams of the previous decade, to find out what made them different. He discovered that the most successful teams were those with a common, unified vision. They were aligned and in tune with each other's intentions.

Now, experts are revisiting the idea of shared vision, but with a new twist – the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to provide that common vision. AI has the potential to be a unifying force for teams, helping them achieve greater alignment even when members are physically distant.

Business teams, for example, can employ AI to better understand each other's feelings and motivations. With AI, team members can be located anywhere in the world and still feel connected. Dr. Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic, chief innovation officer at ManpowerGroup, refers to this as ""artificial emotional intelligence"" (AEI). AEI involves computers understanding how we feel and think, which is a crucial aspect of human emotional intelligence.

Through natural language processing, AI can analyze the language used by team members to estimate their morale, engagement, and enthusiasm. This information can be valuable for managers to understand their team members. AI can also analyze body language during video meetings, providing insights into how team members are feeling. It's like a ""Shazam for the soul.""

However, AI is currently not optimized to bring teams closer together. It primarily focuses on enhancing individual productivity within a team. While AI has the potential to reshape collaboration and communication, it is still in the early stages of development. Many AI applications are currently used as administrative assistants, handling tasks like notetaking, transcription, and real-time translation.

As AI becomes more widely adopted and reliable, it has the potential to break down barriers that hinder collaboration and communication. It can suggest relevant documents and information, improving collaboration and reducing stress. However, it's important to strike a balance and not over-rely on AI. Human touch and spontaneous collaboration are essential for team cohesion.

Over-reliance on data-driven creativity can also be problematic. It may lead to formulaic content and stifled innovation. As AI evolves, it's crucial to explore its impact on team dynamics and ensure that it supports true innovation.

In conclusion, AI has the potential to bring teams together by enhancing alignment and understanding among members. It can provide a common vision and help overcome geographical barriers. However, AI is currently in its early stages and primarily serves as an administrative assistant. As AI continues to develop, it's essential to strike a balance between AI and human collaboration to maintain team cohesion and foster true innovation.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66025c981748a83933081202/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-26 01:28:39,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/can-you-hear-me-now-ai-coustics-to-fight-noisy-audio-with-generative-ai/,Can you hear me now? AI-coustics to fight noisy audio with generative AI,"Can you hear me now? AI-coustics to fight noisy audio with generative AI

Noisy audio recordings can be a major headache for audio engineers. But a German startup called AI-coustics aims to change that with its unique approach that utilizes generative AI to improve the clarity of voices in videos. Recently, AI-coustics came out of stealth mode with €1.9 million in funding. According to CEO Fabian Seipel, their technology goes beyond standard noise suppression and works seamlessly across all devices and speakers.

The core mission of AI-coustics is to ensure that every digital interaction, whether it's a conference call, consumer device, or casual social media video, sounds as clear as a professionally produced broadcast. Seipel, who has a background in audio engineering, co-founded AI-coustics with Corvin Jaedicke, a machine learning lecturer at the Technical University of Berlin, in 2021. They were inspired to start the company after experiencing poor audio quality in their online courses and tutorials.

The market for AI-powered noise-suppressing and voice-enhancing software is already quite robust. AI-coustics' competitors include Insoundz, which uses generative AI to improve streamed and pre-recorded speech clips, and Veed.io, a video editing suite that offers tools to remove background noise from clips. However, AI-coustics believes it has a unique approach to developing AI mechanisms for noise reduction.

The startup trains its model on speech samples recorded in its studio in Berlin. People are paid to record these samples, which are then added to a data set used to train AI-coustics' noise-reducing model. Moreover, the company has developed a special approach to simulate various audio artifacts and problems during the training process.

While AI-coustics' compensation scheme for creators may raise some concerns, the company believes it is important to focus on recruiting diverse speech sample contributors. This is crucial to eliminate bias and ensure the technology works effectively for all languages, speaker identities, ages, accents, and genders. Bias in speech recognition algorithms is a well-known issue, with studies showing that leading companies' algorithms are more likely to incorrectly transcribe audio from Black speakers compared to white speakers.

To test AI-coustics' capabilities, I uploaded three video clips to their platform: an interview with an 18th-century farmer, a car driving demo, and an Israel-Palestine conflict protest. The processed clips had significantly less background noise, making the speakers' voices clearer and more intelligible.

Seipel envisions AI-coustics' technology being used for real-time speech enhancement as well as recorded speech. It could even be embedded in devices like soundbars, smartphones, and headphones to automatically enhance voice clarity. Currently, AI-coustics offers a web app and API for post-processing audio and video recordings, as well as an SDK for integrating their platform into existing workflows, apps, and hardware.

AI-coustics, which generates revenue through subscriptions, on-demand pricing, and licensing, currently has five enterprise customers and 20,000 users. The company plans to expand its team and improve its speech-enhancing model in the coming months. With a strong network of investors and mentors in Germany and the U.K., AI-coustics is well-positioned for growth and success in the market.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1009979808.jpg?resize=1200,801",2024-03-25 18:43:01,Innovation,Innovation

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-strategy-suppress-strain-propagation-ultrahigh.html,A strategy to suppress strain propagation in ultrahigh-Ni cathodes during fast charging,"To support the growing demand for the electronics industry and the widespread use of electric vehicles, researchers are constantly looking for ways to improve battery technologies. One promising approach is the use of nickel-rich layered oxides as cathode materials in lithium-ion batteries (LiBs).

These Ni-rich cathodes offer several advantages, including increased battery capacity, improved rate capabilities, and reduced fabrication costs. However, they also have limitations, such as capacity degradation and structural instability during fast-charging and long-term cycling.

To address these limitations, a team of researchers from Argonne National Laboratory and other institutes worldwide has introduced a new strategy. They have developed an epitaxial entropy-assisted oxide coating that can improve the structural stability and reliability of ultrahigh-Ni cathodes. The findings of their study were published in Nature Energy.

The researchers identified surface reconstruction and strain propagation as the main causes of cathode failure during fast charging and prolonged cycling. Previous attempts to address these issues have not been successful in simultaneously improving the electro-chemomechanical instability without sacrificing energy and power density.

Their new strategy involves using a specialized oxide coating that aligns with the structure of Ni-rich cathodes. These coatings not only enhance the robustness of the cathode materials' surface but also improve ionic conductivity, enabling faster charging of batteries.

The team's coating is based on Wadsley-Roth crystallographic shear phases, which have been found to enhance electrode performance in LiBs. These compounds adhere better to Ni-rich cathodes, increasing their structural stability during prolonged operation and fast-charging.

The researchers conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of their coating strategy. They coated Ni-rich layered cathodes and tested their performance over time and under different conditions. The results were highly promising, as the coating significantly reduced damage to the cathodes, even during fast-charging and after multiple operation cycles.

Overall, the researchers believe that their epitaxial entropy-assisted coating strategy has the potential to open up new opportunities for surface engineering in the design and development of high-energy and high-power LiBs.

In conclusion, researchers have developed a novel approach to enhance the structural stability and reliability of ultrahigh-Ni cathodes in LiBs. Their epitaxial entropy-assisted oxide coating improves the robustness of cathode materials' surface, enhances ionic conductivity, and reduces damage during fast-charging and prolonged cycling. This strategy shows great promise in advancing battery technologies for the electronics industry and electric vehicles.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/a-strategy-to-suppress.jpg,2024-03-25 09:40:01,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/telegrams-peer-to-peer-sms-login-service-is-a-privacy-nightmare/,Telegram’s peer-to-peer SMS login service is a privacy nightmare,"Telegram, the popular instant messaging app, has recently introduced a controversial new feature that offers users a free premium membership. However, this offer comes with a catch - users must allow the app to utilize their phone numbers as a relay for sending one-time SMS passwords to other users. This has sparked concerns about potential privacy risks and the exposure of personal information.

The feature, initially discovered by the TGInfoEn Telegram channel, is currently being rolled out in select countries for Telegram for Android users. If users agree to let Telegram use their phone numbers as an OTP (one-time password) relay, they will receive a transferable code for a complimentary Telegram Premium subscription.

However, the terms of service for this peer-to-peer login program state that Telegram will only send a maximum of 150 OTP messages per month. Users who participate in the program may also be charged for local and international SMS usage, potentially resulting in higher phone bills compared to the value of the premium membership.

Moreover, there are significant privacy concerns associated with this feature. Allowing strangers to use users' phone numbers as a relay could lead to spam and fraudulent activities. Although Telegram does offer the option to hide phone numbers from strangers, participating in the peer-to-peer login system may expose users' Telegram accounts to potential abuse.

The terms of service for this feature also state that Telegram will not be held liable for any damages or unforeseen consequences resulting from users' participation in the program. This raises questions about the level of responsibility the company is willing to assume.

Telegram advises users not to engage with individuals who receive an OTP code from their phone numbers. However, there is currently no way for the company to enforce this recommendation, leaving users potentially vulnerable to misuse of their phone numbers.

Telegram introduced its subscription service two years ago, offering features such as transcription, exclusive stickers, reactions, and other customizations to paid users. The app has since added additional features, including Stories, exclusively for paid subscribers. However, users considering the peer-to-peer login system must weigh the benefits of saving a few bucks against the potential risks of sharing their phone numbers with strangers.

In conclusion, the introduction of the peer-to-peer login feature on Telegram has raised concerns regarding privacy risks and the exposure of personal information. Users should carefully consider the potential consequences before participating in this program, as the benefits of a free premium membership may not outweigh the potential drawbacks.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/telegram-flames-draft.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-26 06:22:21,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2024/03/25/generative-ai-can-create-just-about-everything-but-will-it-ever-create-jobs/,Generative AI Can Create Just About Everything-But Will It Ever Create Jobs?,"Generative AI: The Future of Work

In recent years, generative AI has made significant strides, proving its ability to write letters, reports, and even movie scripts. However, this advancement in technology has also raised concerns about potential job losses and obsolescence. In fact, IBM recently announced downsizing its marketing and communications team due, in part, to generative AI. It is estimated that over one-third of companies using AI have already replaced workers in 2023, with 44% expecting further layoffs in 2024.

The question we now face is not about the capabilities of generative AI, but rather how human workers can remain relevant in a post-gen-AI world. As we embrace a future defined by AI, it is crucial for workers in the global economy to acknowledge that efficiency will always be a driving force. Just as automation revolutionized manufacturing jobs, AI is poised to transform many white-collar jobs, including marketing and beyond. Businesses, especially in America, prioritize maximizing profits, and any technology that enables them to work faster, create more, and gain deeper insights will be seen as a positive asset. Research indicates that by 2030, approximately one-third of the hours currently worked in the US economy could be automated, partially due to generative AI.

While generative AI may create new jobs, it is uncertain whether these roles will align with individuals' skills and preferences. The work landscape is likely to undergo significant changes, and we must adapt to the technological revolution. Consider the following scenario: if AI allows programmers to develop a new game 50% faster and with fewer resources, we will still require fewer programmers, even if the demand for the game increases. This necessitates a shift in our mindset towards work and our role within it. Acquiring new AI skills and embracing an 'AI mentality' focused on automation and data-oriented value creation will be crucial. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang has expressed the view that the conventional path of becoming a programmer may not guarantee long-term job security.

Which jobs are most vulnerable to significant reductions due to generative AI? Here is a list of the top 10 roles that could see a 50-80% decrease in full-time equivalents (FTEs):

1. Website and copy development
2. Marketing Automation
3. Sales and Sales Development Representatives
4. Basic Legal Support for Personal and Business Tax Filing and Basic Business Accounting
5. Customer Service L1/L2
6. Light Coding and Application Development
7. Social Media Content and Press Releases
8. Inventory Management and Optimization
9. HR and Talent Management and Identification

This is not an exhaustive list, but for startups and small businesses, the rapid development of vertical AI and LLM capabilities offers significant productivity and efficiency gains while reducing personnel costs.

Sam Altman of OpenAI suggests that in the future, we may witness single-person billion-dollar companies. While this may seem far-fetched, it is increasingly plausible that 10-20 person companies could generate over $100 million in revenue and potentially reach a billion by leveraging generative AI and intelligent chatbots effectively.

Generative AI can be seen as both a competitor and a friend. Individuals with limited design or writing skills can now rely on AI to create beautiful graphic layouts, compose letters, reports, and even marketing campaigns. AI can also assess the success of these campaigns in real-time and make adjustments if needed. While generative AI is not perfect and may sometimes produce flawed outcomes, it continues to improve exponentially as technology and algorithms advance.

So, how can you remain relevant in a world where AI can accomplish so much? First and foremost, stay engaged. It may be tempting to let AI handle all the work, but resist that urge. While AI undoubtedly offers immense capabilities, human involvement is still crucial. Embrace the opportunities for growth and development that arise as a result of generative AI. By staying informed, acquiring new skills, and adapting to the changing landscape, you can ensure your continued relevance in an AI-driven world.

In conclusion, generative AI is set to redefine the future of work. As technology continues to advance, it is essential for workers to recognize the impact of AI on their respective fields. While there may be concerns about job displacement, it is also important to acknowledge the potential for new and unexpected roles to emerge. By embracing the possibilities offered by generative AI and maintaining an active role in the workforce, individuals can navigate the changing landscape and remain valuable contributors to their industries.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660212b5f2d67f4b8ae63aa3/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 20:24:50,Innovation,Innovation

When we think of Amazon, we often envision the delivery trucks that bring packages to our doors. However, Amazon is much more than just a logistics company. It is a global leader in innovation, with significant investments in infrastructure, supply chain management, IT, and transportation.

What many people may not realize is that Amazon has been incorporating AI and machine learning into its processes long before it became a popular buzzword. Now, the company is taking this expertise and applying it to the world of education. We had the opportunity to speak with Victor Reinoso, the global director of education philanthropy at Amazon, about the future of education and AI.

Victor Reinoso is a passionate advocate for computer science education and has been involved in various roles across venture capitalism, consulting, and government. Before joining Amazon, he served as the deputy mayor of Washington D.C., where he oversaw the city's education budget of over $1 billion. His diverse experiences allow him to bring a unique perspective to his role at Amazon, where he focuses on investing in innovations and nonprofit partnerships that prepare young people for future careers.

One of the biggest challenges schools face when integrating AI education into their curriculums is a lack of resources and training for teachers. While there is a strong desire among educators to teach AI content, they often struggle to find the tools and support they need. According to a recent survey conducted by Amazon and Access Partnership, 70% of educators lack the resources to teach AI skills, despite 60% believing that these skills should be taught from an early age.

To address this education gap, Amazon is taking several steps. They are funding professional development for teachers, helping school districts implement sustainable STEM education initiatives and improve job readiness for students. Additionally, Amazon is increasing awareness and access to tools and curriculum. Through their AI Ready commitment, they aim to provide free AI skills training to two million people by 2025. They have also partnered with Code.org to create the Hour of Code Dance Party: AI Edition, an engaging introduction to coding and generative AI for K-12 students and teachers. Furthermore, Amazon is offering scholarships and free courses on AI and generative AI to high school and university students, as well as professionals in the workplace.

While the integration of AI into education brings many opportunities, it also raises the important issue of responsible AI use.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-semiconductors-scale-processor-remarkable-speedup.html,Semiconductors at scale: New processor achieves remarkable speedup in problem solving,"Annealing processors are a specialized type of processors designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems. These processors have practical applications in various fields such as logistics, resource allocation, and drug and material discovery. One key requirement for annealing processors is that their components need to be fully ""coupled,"" which directly impacts their scalability.

In a recent study published in IEEE Access, Professor Takayuki Kawahara and his team from Tokyo University of Science have developed a scalable annealing processor that addresses this coupling complexity. The researchers divided the calculation into multiple LSI chips, allowing for improved scalability. This innovative approach was presented at the IEEE 22nd World Symposium on Applied Machine Intelligence and Informatics (SAMI 2024) on January 25, 2024.

The goal of this research is to achieve advanced information processing directly at the edge, rather than relying on cloud computing or performing preprocessing at the edge for the cloud. In 2020, Tokyo University of Science introduced a unique processing architecture that enabled the creation of a fully coupled LSI on a single chip using 28nm CMOS technology. In 2022, the team devised a scalable method using parallel-operating chips and demonstrated its feasibility with Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).

The researchers developed a scalable annealing processor using 36 22nm CMOS calculation LSI chips and one control FPGA. This technology allows for the construction of large-scale, fully coupled semiconductor systems based on the Ising model, which is a mathematical model of magnetic systems. The system incorporates two technologies developed at Tokyo University of Science: the ""spin thread method"" that enables 8 parallel solution searches and a technique that reduces chip requirements by about half compared to conventional methods. The processor operates at 10MHz with a power consumption of 2.9W (1.3W for the core part), making it power-efficient.

In terms of power performance ratio, the processor outperforms simulating a fully coupled Ising system on a PC (i7, 3.6GHz) using annealing emulation by 2,306 times. It also surpasses the core CPU and arithmetic chip by 2,186 times. This successful machine verification suggests the possibility of enhanced capacity.

Professor Kawahara envisions the social implementation of this technology, including the initiation of a business, joint research, and technology transfer. He aims to develop this technology for an LSI system with the computing power of a 2050-level quantum computer for solving combinatorial optimization problems. The goal is to achieve this without the need for air conditioning, large equipment, or cloud infrastructure, using current semiconductor processes. By 2030, the team aims to achieve 2 million spins and explore the creation of new digital industries.

In summary, Professor Kawahara and his team have developed a scalable, fully coupled annealing processor with 4096 spins on a single board. This processor incorporates key innovations such as chip reduction and parallel operations for simultaneous solution searches. The successful machine verification of this processor opens up possibilities for enhanced capacity and the development of new digital industries.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/semiconductors-at-scal.jpg,2024-03-25 13:50:03,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/maju-kuruvilla-is-out-as-ceo-of-one-click-checkout-company-bolt/,Maju Kuruvilla is out as CEO of one-click checkout company Bolt,"Bolt, the one-click checkout company, has announced a change in leadership. Maju Kuruvilla, the former CEO, has been replaced by Justin Grooms, who previously served as Bolt's global head of sales. Grooms has taken on the role of interim CEO, as stated on his LinkedIn profile.

While Kuruvilla did not provide much information about the change, he confirmed it on both LinkedIn and X, posting, ""One-Click Checkedout from @bolt! Onwards"" along with a rocket emoji. Arjun Sethi, a co-founder of venture firm Tribe Capital, commented on Kuruvilla's post, expressing his positive experience working with the executive.

The decision to remove Kuruvilla was made by the Bolt board, as reported by The Information. Kuruvilla, a former executive at Amazon, took over as CEO in January 2022 after founder Ryan Breslow stepped down.

Grooms has been with Bolt for five years, having previously held executive positions at companies such as Ultraleap (formerly Leap Motion), Datron World Communications, and Qualcomm. According to his LinkedIn profile, the company stated that the CEO role had changed and described Kuruvilla's departure as ""amicable,"" without providing further details.

Bolt has faced its fair share of controversy in the past. The company was founded by Breslow, who dropped out of Stanford at the age of 27. Known for his outspoken rants, Breslow led Bolt until his departure.

In an interview with TechCrunch in the month he stepped down, Breslow mentioned that the company had secured around 10 major deals in the second half of 2021, each surpassing any previous deals in Bolt's history.

However, Bolt encountered some difficulties along the way. The company was under federal investigation regarding possible violations of securities laws during its 2021 fundraising efforts. During that time, Bolt was seeking a Series E round of funding worth $355 million, valuing the company at $11 billion. In total, Bolt raised approximately $1 billion in venture-backed funding.

The company also underwent multiple rounds of layoffs, including one in May 2022, which resulted in the termination of at least 185 employees, or one-third of its workforce. Further layoffs occurred in early 2023 and December 2023, affecting 29% of the staff.

In October, Kuruvilla, as the CEO at the time, informed TechCrunch that the SEC was no longer investigating Bolt. He also mentioned that the company was focusing on profitability and had plans to introduce new features, such as improving merchandise returns and providing personalized experiences through its universal shopper network. Bolt announced partnerships with retailers like Saks OFF 5TH, Shinola, Filson, Lafayette 148, and Toys ""R"" Us in November.

More recently, Bolt entered into a deal with Checkout.com, becoming the exclusive one-click checkout provider for Checkout.com. In return, Checkout.com became Bolt's preferred payment partner.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/25/google-update-warning-chrome-windows-11-android-iphone/,Google’s New AI Search Goes Horribly Wrong-M Is For Malware,"Be cautious about what you search for—Google's new AI search might not be as safe as you think. The search giant recently launched its Search Generative Experience (SGE), an AI-powered search feature that aims to revolutionize traditional search results. However, it seems that the initial update has encountered some serious issues.

Last week, an SEO consultant experimenting with the new technology stumbled upon obvious scams within the search results. Bleeping Computer, a reputable source, confirmed these findings and warned that the new AI algorithms recommended scam websites that redirected visitors to malicious Chrome extensions, fake iPhone giveaways, browser spam subscriptions, and tech support scams.

The problem lies in the nature of generative AI—these dangers are cleverly disguised in friendly and conversational language, catching users off guard. Most of the fraudulent redirects seemed to target personal information, adware, or unwanted subscriptions to earn commission payments. However, some of the links were even more sinister, promoting browser extensions that hijack searches and potentially engage in other malicious activities.

Google responded to Bleeping Computer, stating that they continue to update their advanced spam-fighting systems to prevent spam from infiltrating search results. They assured that they employ these anti-spam measures to protect the Search Generative Experience. Furthermore, they took action to remove the examples shared by Bleeping Computer, as they were appearing for uncommon queries. I have reached out to Google for further comments on these issues.

While SGE was previously an opt-in feature, it is now expanding its reach. According to 9to5Google, Google is starting to show AI-powered overviews to users who have not signed up for SGE. This test is currently being conducted on a small percentage of search traffic in specific categories, limited to users in the United States who are not logged into a Google account.

It is essential to note that the examples provided were from an opt-in Search Labs user, not a general user experiencing AI test results. Hopefully, by the time SGE becomes more widely available, any such issues will have been resolved.

Nevertheless, it is crucial to recognize that this presents a new threat landscape that can be exploited with fresh tricks, targeting an audience that is not yet familiar with these tactics. Despite these initial challenges, AI search undeniably represents the future of search. However, there is a valuable lesson here—to exercise caution as we venture into uncharted territory and remember that, despite the conversational language, the usual rules of safe searching still apply.

These problems will worsen as search becomes further integrated into generative AI chatbots, without the luxury of displaying search results. Before this integration occurs, significant improvements are required to enhance filtering and defense mechanisms.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6602155031526c87ed877205/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3115,2027,x1040,y734,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 21:15:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/25/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-upgrade-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-s23/,Apple’s Surprise Update Just Made iPhone More Like Android,"Apple’s recent AI developments have taken the tech world by surprise, and the latest rumor seems to confirm that the landscape for the iPhone has drastically changed. With newfound security and privacy risks, Apple is faced with navigating uncharted territory.

For years, Apple has prided itself on being more private and secure than its competitor, Android. However, the gap between the two is closing as Google strengthens its security and privacy measures while Apple makes its own concessions.

The recent news from China adds an interesting twist to the story. Reports suggest that Apple's discussions with Chinese search engine giant Baidu about a generative AI deal have been confirmed. This means that Chinese generative AI will be making its way to the iPhone, specifically in China.

Baidu's AI model has gained approval from the Chinese government, with whom the company has strong ties. There have even been reports suggesting potential military AI connections, although these claims have been denied. This partnership with Baidu raises questions for Apple, a company that has always prioritized privacy.

In China, AI is heavily regulated, with only government-approved models allowed. While the primary focus of these approvals is censorship and preventing dissent, there is always the underlying context of surveillance, monitoring, and control. Apple has been navigating these challenges since its early days in China, and as its presence in the country grows, so do the complexities.

AI presents a particularly difficult path to tread because of its potential to rapidly expand its role in our lives, particularly on our smartphones. Granting or denying AI access to our most sensitive information will be an ongoing challenge. Baidu, like other Chinese tech companies, is subject to the same national security laws that have sparked debates around companies like ByteDance/TikTok and Huawei.

Initially, there were speculations that Apple's generative AI plans for iOS 18 would be on-device, using hardware and software designed by Apple to ensure privacy and security in the AI realm. This approach would be a logical extension of its commitment to end-to-end encryption and user controls. The idea was that what happens on the iPhone stays on the iPhone.

There were even reports of Apple testing its on-device AI against Chat-GPT and other models to ensure reliable results. However, things took a turn when news broke that Apple was in talks with Google about using its Gemini technology.

From a privacy standpoint, Google's AI is primarily cloud-based, although it does have lighter-weight on-device functionality with Nano. The idea that Apple was considering integrating this Google technology into the iPhone surprised many. It became the tech industry's talking point of the year, at least until the Department of Justice intervened.

While an Apple-Google alliance seemed unlikely due to their differing approaches to AI, cloud, encryption, and privacy, there was a ruthless commercial logic behind it. Google is a leader in generative AI and has made significant progress in applying it to smartphones, apps, and services. The exclusive iPhone search arrangement also paved the way for this partnership. Time is of the essence.

This convergence between iPhone and Android is just one example of how the two platforms are becoming more closely aligned. Samsung, for instance, has its own mix and match approach, using Google Gemini in the cloud and its own AI on device. Samsung seeks to strike a balance between AI features and user privacy/data security. Interestingly, Samsung also has the same Gemini/Baidu combination.

Samsung's approach is described as a ""hybrid approach that combines on-device and cloud-based AI."" This approach allows users to limit certain features to function entirely on-device, giving them greater control over their data. Apple seems to be contemplating a similar strategy for the iPhone.

""When integrated into phones, AI is, to put it simply, a revolution,"" said Samsung's TM Roh. ""It's also important to raise the standards of security and privacy in this new era of data-intensive mobile experiences.""

Previously, I assumed that Apple would take a more locked-down approach when it comes to on-device versus cloud AI, with privacy considerations at the forefront. I also noted the balancing act that Samsung had to perform with both Google's and its own AI on its devices. I did not expect Apple to find itself in the exact same position, especially with the added factor of Chinese generative AI.

I have reached out to Apple for further information on their plans and will update this article as more details emerge. It is clear that the AI landscape is rapidly evolving, and Apple is at a critical juncture in navigating these changes while maintaining its commitment to privacy and security.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65aeed369be3a016e61b4a9a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 23:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-high-efficiency-based-copperiodide-clusters.html,A high efficiency LED based on copper-iodide clusters,"A team of researchers led by Professor Yao Hongbin from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) has made a significant breakthrough in the field of lighting technology. They have developed a high efficiency, high brightness warm white light-emitting diode (LED) using copper-iodide cluster hybrids. This innovative solution-processed LED has the potential to revolutionize the future of large-area solid-state lighting.

Solution-processed LEDs are widely regarded as the next generation of lighting technology due to their simple manufacturing process and high operability. Up until now, solution-processed LED devices have primarily been based on lead-halide perovskites, organic semiconductor materials, and colloidal core-shell quantum dots (QDs), which have demonstrated impressive electroluminescence performance.

However, these materials often contain heavy metals like lead-halide perovskites and CdSe QDs, which pose significant environmental concerns. On the other hand, LED devices based on organic light-emitting molecules, InP QDs, and ZnSe QDs have high production costs due to their complex synthesis. Therefore, the development of solution-processed LEDs based on cost-effective, non-toxic, easily scalable, and highly efficient emitters is crucial for the advancement of solid-state lighting.

To address this challenge, Professor Yao's team focused on designing and preparing a copper-iodine-based hybrid cluster with a wide photoluminescence spectrum. By incorporating nitrogen-phosphine chelating ligands and phosphine-containing solubilizing ligands, the team successfully synthesized copper-iodide hybrid clusters with both high luminescence efficiency and solubility. These clusters exhibited exceptional solubility of over 200 mg/mL and excellent structural stability in N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF), a cross-solvent commonly used in LED production.

The team then fabricated luminescent thin films by spin-coating the copper-iodide hybrid clusters in DMF. These films displayed a remarkably low surface roughness of 0.22 nm and a high photoluminescence quantum yield exceeding 70%. This made them ideal for use as a luminescent layer in the production of low-cost warm-white LED devices using an orthogonal solvent route.

The resulting LED devices achieved remarkable performance metrics, including a maximum external quantum efficiency of 19.1%, a brightness surpassing 40,000 cd m-2, and an operational lifetime of over 232 hours (T 50 @100 cd m-2). Moreover, thanks to the excellent solubility and processability of the copper-iodide hybrid clusters, the team successfully constructed a large-area solution-processed LED device with a working area of 36 cm2 using blade-coating. This device emitted warm white light with a brightness approaching 60,000 cd m-2.

Furthermore, by modifying various electron-donating groups on the nitrogen heterocycles of the nitrogen-phosphine chelating ligands, the team developed a range of solution-processed color-tunable LED devices.

This groundbreaking research has demonstrated the feasibility of developing high-efficiency, high-brightness LED devices based on copper-iodide hybrid clusters. The structural expandability and spectral tunability of these clusters hold great promise for the fabrication of low-cost, high-performance LED panels and solid-state lighting.

In conclusion, Professor Yao Hongbin and his team at USTC have made significant strides in the field of lighting technology with their development of a solution-processed LED based on copper-iodide cluster hybrids. This breakthrough paves the way for the future of large-area solid-state lighting by offering a cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and highly efficient alternative to existing LED technologies. With further research and development, these copper-iodide hybrid clusters have the potential to transform the lighting industry and contribute to a more sustainable future.
