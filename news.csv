This is because cars and trucks contribute nearly 30% of greenhouse gas emissions. To achieve this goal, the Biden Administration has introduced new regulations aimed at cutting automotive CO2 emissions. These regulations could lead to over 56% of new passenger vehicle sales being electric by 2032, a significant increase from their current market share. While some environmentalists criticize the revised rules for not being stringent enough, automakers view them as a roadmap for a clean transportation revolution.

In 2023, U.S. electric vehicle (EV) sales reached a record high of 1.2 million units, accounting for just under 8% of new vehicle sales. However, the pace has slowed in 2024 due to factors such as higher prices compared to gasoline models, high interest rates, and a lack of public charging infrastructure. Despite this, analysts predict that increased domestic sourcing of battery materials like lithium and graphite, as well as a wider range of EV models, including more affordable options, will make both battery-only and plug-in hybrid vehicles more attractive to consumers throughout the decade.

However, there are potential obstacles to the widespread adoption of EVs. Republicans generally oppose efforts to transition away from gasoline-powered vehicles, and a second term for Donald Trump, who is not a supporter of EVs and has previously rolled back auto pollution rules, could undermine the new regulations. Nevertheless, automakers appreciate the flexibility offered by the new rules, which allow them to meet annual targets using a combination of technologies, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and battery-only models. Moreover, as significant investments flow into new battery and materials plants, primarily located in conservative states, these plants will create tens of thousands of jobs. This economic factor may discourage support for continuing to rely on gas-guzzling vehicles.

On another note, Norwegian tech startup Heimdall Power claims that its sensors and software can increase the capacity of existing transmission lines by up to 40%. The company recently secured its largest U.S. deal to date, supplying dozens of its Neuron sensors, also known as ""magic balls,"" to Minnesota's Great River Energy. Great River Energy is a cooperative of 27 power companies that provide electricity to 1.7 million people and businesses in Minnesota, North Dakota, and Wisconsin. A pilot project conducted using Heimdall's technology on a few of Great River's lines resulted in a 43% increase in capacity. Heimdall's CEO, JÃ¸rgen Festervoll, compares the powerline's temperature to a speed limit, and states that without the software and sensors, it's like driving without a speedometer.

Additionally, there have been concerns raised about the recycling of plastic waste from Amazon. A report found that out of 93 bundles of Amazon plastic waste dropped off at store bins in 10 states, only four made it to recycling centers. Plastic film, such as bubble wrap, is particularly challenging to recycle. Many people are unaware that plastic packaging from Amazon cannot be placed in curbside recycling but must be taken to specific drop-off locations. Failure to do so results in contamination at local recycling centers. Some suggest that Amazon should stop using plastic packaging altogether and switch to more environmentally friendly alternatives, such as paper and cardboard boxes.

In conclusion, the transition to electric vehicles is a crucial step in reducing carbon emissions and combating climate change. While challenges exist, such as political opposition and consumer concerns, there is growing support for cleaner transportation options. Innovations in technology, such as Heimdall Power's sensors and software, offer promising solutions for increasing the capacity of transmission lines. Additionally, addressing the issue of plastic waste from online retailers like Amazon requires a shift towards more sustainable packaging alternatives. By prioritizing sustainability and embracing cleaner technologies, we can make significant progress in creating a greener future.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fba1ea7a12ebb47aaa74bb/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2312,1300,x661,y0,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 06:30:00,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/03/25/building-a-global-secured-wireless-network-a-strategic-approach-for-enterprise/,Building A Global Secured Wireless Network,"In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, it is crucial for enterprises and government organizations to ensure a secure and efficient connection for mobile devices. With the rise of remote working, there has been a significant increase in the shipment of cellular-embedded laptops, with numbers expected to continue growing in the coming years. This push for ""always connected"" PCs is driven by the need to improve productivity and leverage new capabilities offered by AI and cloud computing.

However, CIOs face challenges in managing the cost and security of their enterprise mobile network on a global scale. In this article, we will explore the current methods used to establish secure mobile networks for employees and discuss alternative strategies to consider for deploying global mobile connectivity.

One popular method employed by enterprises is the use of VPNs (Virtual Private Networks). VPNs provide secure remote access to employees, regardless of their location, by encrypting data and protecting it from interception or unauthorized access. This ensures compliance with industry standards and allows businesses to maintain data integrity and connectivity requirements in today's remote and digital landscape. VPNs are also cost-effective compared to other options such as leased lines or hardware-based encryption devices, making them suitable for businesses of all sizes.

However, deploying VPN clients on mobile devices through mobile device management (MDM) can be challenging. While VPNs encrypt data during transmission, they are still vulnerable to security flaws, potentially exposing organizations to cyber threats. Managing VPN clients individually can be cumbersome and may result in inconsistent security policies and breaches. Additionally, scaling VPN infrastructure globally can lead to latency and performance issues, impacting user experience.

Multinational companies face the additional challenge of managing mobile data connectivity offered by different mobile operators in each country. This poses integration and management hurdles, hindering organizations from exercising full control over their data costs. This is despite the productivity benefits of a cellular-first strategy for their workforce.

To address these challenges, one option is to securely integrate with the core infrastructure of mobile network operators by requesting private APNs and dedicated lines between data centers. This approach completely isolates the device from public networks, making it popular for deployments within a single country. However, it becomes complex and resource-intensive when connecting to a large network of mobile operators and distributed corporate applications. The associated costs can also escalate, making it less attractive for large-scale deployments.

For CIOs looking to leverage public mobile networks while maintaining security comparable to private networks and achieving cost efficiency, there are several strategies available. One tactic is to integrate post-quantum cryptography, which enhances overall network security. This proactive measure ensures resilience against future threats, strengthening the network against unauthorized access and data breaches. While these encryption solutions have traditionally been prevalent in defense and military sectors, they are now expanding into enterprise versions with enhanced security measures for businesses operating in dynamic digital environments.

Another innovative solution involves transitioning to a software-defined networking (SDN) client. By utilizing SDN, network policies can be dynamically adjusted to meet the changing needs of the organization. This flexibility allows for efficient network management and reduces the reliance on individual VPN clients. SDN also offers centralized control and visibility, simplifying the management of a global mobile network.

In conclusion, ensuring a secure and efficient mobile network for employees is crucial in today's digital landscape. While VPNs have been widely used, they come with their own challenges in terms of security and management. Alternative strategies such as integrating with mobile network operators' infrastructure, implementing post-quantum cryptography, or transitioning to SDN clients offer solutions to these challenges. CIOs must carefully consider their options to find the most secure and cost-effective solution for their organization's mobile connectivity needs.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fdbad69183dd117b0e8a15/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 06:30:00,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.forbes.com/sites/anuradhavaranasi/2024/03/25/the-countries-most-and-least-accepting-of-autistic-individuals/,The Countries Least Accepting Of Autistic Individuals,"A recent survey conducted in eight different countries revealed that autistic individuals in Japan and Belgium experience the lowest levels of societal acceptance. The study included participants from the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, and Belgium. While autistic people in Canada, the UK, and South Africa reported slightly higher levels of acceptance, only 23.5% of the participants across all countries felt accepted by society as an autistic person.

The researchers defined autism acceptance as an individual feeling appreciated and recognized for being autistic, with autism being positively acknowledged by both oneself and others. It is crucial to understand that autistic individuals face a higher risk of psychiatric and mental health disorders throughout their lives. In fact, they are at an elevated risk of premature mortality, with their lifespan being nearly two decades shorter compared to their non-autistic peers. Depression and anxiety are the most common psychiatric co-morbidities for autistic adults, with prevalence rates reaching as high as 47% and 54%, respectively.

There are several factors that contribute to the elevated mental health difficulties experienced by autistic individuals. For instance, the prevalence of alexithymia, a subclinical condition characterized by difficulties in identifying, expressing, and differentiating emotions, is significantly higher among the autistic population compared to the non-autistic population. Another significant factor is that autistic individuals belong to a marginalized minority group and face various ""minority stressors,"" including everyday discrimination and internalized stigma.

In the UK, the majority of autistic individuals feel that society either does not accept them or only sometimes accepts them as autistic individuals. Despite this, previous research had not directly explored the experiences of autistic people regarding autism acceptance and its relationship with mental health difficulties.

Autistic individuals often find themselves compelled to camouflage their autistic traits to avoid rejection or discrimination. This behavior, known as ""camouflaging,"" involves using strategies to minimize the visibility of their autism in social situations. For example, they may learn to use eye contact and develop scripts to navigate social interactions. They may also suppress stimming behaviors, such as hand flapping or rocking back and forth, which help them regulate their emotions and bodies in overwhelming environments with loud noises and harsh lights.

Camouflaging is more common among autistic women and those with higher levels of autistic traits. Recent studies suggest that camouflaging may be a risk factor for depression and anxiety in autism, regardless of gender. Autistic individuals who experience more social stressors, such as a lack of autism acceptance, are more likely to camouflage their autistic traits, leading to higher levels of anxiety and depression.

Connor Keating, the lead author of the study from the University of Birmingham's School of Psychology, emphasized the importance of combatting the stigma surrounding autism and reducing the pressure on autistic individuals to conceal their identity. These findings highlight the need for society to be more accepting and understanding of autistic individuals.

The study, titled ""Autism Acceptance and Mental Health Difficulties in Autistic Adults: The Mediating Roles of Camouflaging and Autism Identity Strength,"" was published in PLoS One on March 20, 2024.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66011516945f390030af66b1/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 03:06:35,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/25/map-of-nope-meme-why-youre-in-or-out-for-the-total-solar-eclipse/,âMap Of Nopeâ Meme: Why Youâre In Or Out For The Total Solar Eclipse,"The upcoming total solar eclipse on April 8 is an event that many people are eagerly anticipating. However, there is a significant lack of understanding about what a total solar eclipse is and where one needs to be to fully experience it. This is where the ""Map of Nope"" comes in. Created by eclipse cartographer Michael Zeiler, this map is a valuable tool that helps people understand the importance of being within the narrow path of totality.

The ""Map of Nope"" has gained considerable attention online and has become a phenomenon in its own right. While there are numerous maps and websites available for this eclipse, it is this particular map that effectively conveys the significance of being within the 115-mile-wide path of totality. On April 8, this path will traverse parts of Mexico, 15 U.S. states, and Canada.

One of the major challenges surrounding the total solar eclipse is the lack of knowledge about what it entails and where one needs to be to witness it. Moreover, there is a tendency among event organizers, hotels, and cities to promote locations that will not experience the total solar eclipse, leading to misinformation and confusion among those who wish to witness this celestial event.

It is crucial to understand that there is a world of difference between experiencing totality and witnessing a partial solar eclipse. Precision and comprehension are key when it comes to a total solar eclipse. The word ""total"" itself implies completeness and absoluteness. Dr. Rick Fienberg, the Project Manager of the AAS Solar Eclipse Taskforce, aptly compares totality to pregnancy, stating that one cannot be 99.9% pregnant â either you experience totality or you don't.

Cities such as San Antonio, Fort Smith, Cincinnati, Columbus, Canton, and Youngstown will unfortunately only witness a 99% partial solar eclipse, which is a far cry from the awe-inspiring experience of totality. Only within the path of totality will the sun be entirely obscured by the moon for up to four and a half minutes. The surroundings will darken, the temperature will drop, and one can witness the sun's stunning corona with the naked eye. This is an experience like no other. Outside the path of totality, even just a mile away, one can only observe a partial solar eclipse through special solar eclipse glasses. It will not get dark, it will not get cold, and the sun's corona will not be visible.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/spotify-courses-learning/,Spotify tests video courses to teach everything from music production to Excel,"Spotify, known for its music streaming, podcast entertainment, and audiobooks, is now expanding into the world of e-learning. In an effort to engage its 600 million+ users and encourage them to spend more time and money on the platform, Spotify has partnered with third parties like the BBC and Skillshare to offer freemium video courses. While at least two lessons will be free, the cost of a full course will range from Â£20 to Â£80 on average, with pricing being the same for both basic and premium users. The courses will be accessible on both the web and the Spotify mobile app, and will cover a wide range of subjects, from music production to learning how to use Excel. Spotify plans to curate the courses offered based on user preferences and interests, and will share revenue with content partners and creators.

Spotify's foray into e-learning comes as no surprise, given the growing popularity of online learning platforms. While there are already numerous online learning sites available, Spotify aims to differentiate itself by focusing on one-directional, on-demand video content. While some courses may include supplementary materials, such as extra documents, there won't be interactive components or tests at this time. Spotify has not yet revealed whether it plans to introduce gamification or interaction in the future.

The initial partners for Spotify's e-learning platform include Skillshare, PLAYvirtuoso, BBC Maestro, and Thinkific. Skillshare will focus on creative courses, PLAYvirtuoso will offer music industry courses, BBC Maestro will provide Master Class-like lessons, and Thinkific will cater to those interested in building their own online learning classes. Spotify plans to curate the courses based on user interests, using data from what people are already listening to and searching for on the platform.

The decision to launch the e-learning platform in the UK stems from Spotify's strategy to diversify its business and improve profitability. The UK is a significant market for Spotify and has one of the most engaged user bases globally. Although Spotify has faced financial challenges in recent years, including layoffs and quarterly net losses, the company sees the potential in the online learning and professional development market.

Spotify's move into e-learning aligns with its growing podcasting business. The company has observed a strong correlation between popular podcasts and education content on its platform. Around half of Spotify Premium subscribers have listened to education or self-help themed podcasts, indicating a clear interest in educational content. Spotify plans to leverage its recommendation algorithm to cross-promote podcasts and paid courses, betting that one will help sell the other.

While Spotify's entry into the e-learning market may seem unexpected for a company primarily associated with music streaming, it aligns with the company's goal of diversifying its offerings and increasing user engagement. By leveraging its vast user base, data, and partnerships with content creators, Spotify aims to establish itself as a key player in the e-learning space.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Courses-on-Spotify-PR-Image-6-2.png?resize=1200,683",2024-03-25 08:59:18,Innovation,Innovation
