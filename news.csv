https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-vulnerability-virtual-reality.html,Vulnerability in virtual reality systems identified,"Virtual reality (VR) systems have become increasingly popular, providing users with the ability to immerse themselves in a virtual world where anything is possible. However, a team of computer scientists at the University of Chicago has uncovered a potential vulnerability in VR systems that could be exploited by hackers. They have identified a way for hackers to insert what they call an ""inception layer"" between a user's VR Home Screen and their VR User/Server.

The team has published a paper describing their research and findings on the arXiv preprint server. The researchers imagined a scenario where hackers could add an app to a user's VR headset that tricks them into revealing sensitive information. This app would create a layer between the user and the virtual world they see through their VR device. Drawing inspiration from the movie ""Inception,"" in which a character has an altered layer of reality downloaded into his brain, the researchers named this layer the ""inception layer.""

The potential risks posed by this inception layer are significant. Hackers could record information, such as passcodes entered into a virtual ATM, intercept and manipulate information, such as altering cash amounts designated for a purchase and redirecting the difference to the hacker's account. They could even introduce virtual representations of friends or family members to gain the user's trust and access their secrets. Essentially, the inception layer could monitor or manipulate gestures, voice commands, browsing activity, and social or business interactions.

To test their hypothesis, the researchers enlisted the help of 28 volunteers who played a game using a demonstration VR headset. They then downloaded an app onto the devices, simulating a hacking attempt. Surprisingly, only 10 of the volunteers noticed a slight flickering during the download and activation process, and only one of them questioned whether something suspicious was happening.

The research team promptly informed Meta, the company behind the Meta Quest VR system used in the experiment, about their findings. Meta responded by stating that they would investigate the potential vulnerability and address it if confirmed. The researchers also highlighted that similar vulnerabilities are likely to exist in other VR systems and apps that aim to insert themselves between users and their VR devices.

This discovery underscores the need for continued vigilance when it comes to cybersecurity in the rapidly evolving field of virtual reality. As VR technology becomes more widespread, it is crucial to identify and address potential vulnerabilities to protect users from potential threats. The researchers' work serves as a reminder that hackers are constantly looking for new ways to exploit technology and that developers must prioritize security measures to safeguard users' sensitive information.

In conclusion, while VR systems offer incredible immersive experiences, they also come with their own set of risks. The potential for hackers to insert an inception layer between a user's VR Home Screen and their VR User/Server is a concerning vulnerability. By understanding and addressing these risks, we can continue to enjoy the benefits of VR technology while ensuring our personal information remains secure.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/vulnerability-in-virtu.jpg,2024-03-25 10:20:02,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.zdnet.com/education/professional-development/want-to-be-a-devops-engineer-heres-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/,"Want to be a DevOps engineer? Here's the good, the bad, and the ugly","DevOps engineering is a highly sought-after job in today's economy. However, to excel in this role, one must possess both technical expertise and business acumen. Furthermore, continuous learning is essential to stay up-to-date with the rapidly evolving industry.

The demand for DevOps engineers is immense, and the salary is quite attractive. In the United States, the average annual salary is approximately $134,000. It is a challenging job that comes with its fair share of rewards and challenges, as experienced DevOps engineers will tell you.

To begin with, a solid understanding of foundational technology is crucial. Learning Linux is a must for any DevOps engineer, regardless of the specific role. Familiarity with the basics of Linux, including the command line and terminal, is essential.

In addition to Linux, another key skill for DevOps engineers is bash scripting. Bash scripting is used extensively in the DevOps world, particularly in building pipelines. Automating Linux commands through bash scripting is a valuable skill that can streamline processes.

Cloud skills are also highly valued in the field of DevOps engineering. It is beneficial to focus on mastering one mainstream cloud provider, such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure. Becoming an expert in one cloud platform makes it easier to adapt and learn others in the future.

Becoming a DevOps engineer does not require a formal course of study. Self-learning is the most effective path to success in this field. The ability and willingness to constantly learn and challenge oneself are essential qualities for any aspiring DevOps engineer.

The need for continuous learning was emphasized by seasoned DevOps engineers in a recent presentation. The DevOps ecosystem is vast and constantly evolving. Tools and frameworks that were popular yesterday may be replaced by new alternatives. Therefore, staying updated and dedicating time for self-study is crucial.

Even as one gains more experience, the learning never stops. This is one aspect that DevOps engineers appreciate about their job. With the rapid pace of development and the introduction of AI tools like ChatGPT, the field of DevOps will continue to evolve in the coming years.

Infrastructure management is a significant part of a DevOps engineer's role. Managing servers, databases, networks, and security requires a keen interest in infrastructure management. If this aspect excites you, then DevOps engineering may be the perfect fit.

On the other hand, if you are more interested in software engineering, the infrastructure management aspect may not scratch that coding itch. Building customer-facing applications and flexing coding muscles are different experiences compared to writing Terraforms, CI/CD pipelines, and automation scripts.

However, it is worth noting that transitioning between software engineering and DevOps is possible. Many professionals have successfully made the switch, so it is not a permanent decision.

Lastly, it is important to consider the business side of DevOps. Unrealistic expectations from management can be a challenge. Businesses often expect a small team of engineers to magically solve all their problems. Therefore, it is crucial to manage these expectations and communicate the realities of the role.

In conclusion, DevOps engineering is a highly rewarding but demanding job. It requires a strong foundation in technology, continuous learning, and a passion for infrastructure management. By staying updated, embracing challenges, and effectively managing expectations, one can excel in this exciting field.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/e4d3d8d263eb00323161fcf2566ad35a3fe52282/2024/03/25/1b8b924e-2629-43c2-b416-1b990e262786/gettyimages-1319039490.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.engadget.com/ron-desantis-signs-bill-requiring-parental-consent-for-kids-to-join-social-media-platforms-in-florida-192116891.html,Ron DeSantis signs bill requiring parental consent for kids to join social media platforms in Florida,"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has recently signed a bill named HB 3 that imposes stricter regulations on children under 16 using social media. The law completely prohibits children under the age of 14 from participating in any social media platforms. For 14- and 15-year-olds, parent or guardian consent is required to create or use an account on a social media platform. The companies behind these platforms must comply with requests to delete these accounts within five business days. Failure to do so can result in fines of up to $10,000 per violation, which can increase to $50,000 per instance if the violation is deemed ""knowing or reckless.""

The bill specifies that children under the age of 14 are no longer allowed to create or use social media accounts in Florida. Pre-existing accounts and associated personal information must be deleted by the platforms. Although the bill does not mention any specific social media platforms, it suggests that any service that promotes ""infinite scrolling"" or features display reaction metrics, live-streaming, and auto-play videos will have to adhere to these new rules. However, email platforms are exempt from these regulations.

This law not only affects the online activities of children but also includes a mandatory age verification component. This component is triggered if a website or app contains a ""substantial portion of material"" deemed harmful to users under 18. In such cases, Floridians visiting these sites, such as pornographic websites, will have to verify their age either through a proprietary platform on the site itself or by using a third-party system. However, news agencies are exempt from this requirement, even if they meet the threshold for harmful materials.

Privacy concerns have been raised due to the requirement of providing personal information to access adult content. The bill includes a provision that allows websites to redirect users to an ""anonymous age verification"" system, which involves a third party that is not allowed to retain identifying information. Failure to comply with this restriction can result in a civil penalty of $50,000 per instance.

It is worth noting that DeSantis recently vetoed a similar bill that aimed to ban teens under the age of 16 from using social media apps without the option for parental consent. NetChoice, a trade association representing social media platforms, has criticized the new law, calling it unconstitutional. The association argues that the age verification component will require extensive data collection, which poses risks to Floridians' privacy and security.

Paul Renner, the state's Republican House Speaker, emphasized the need for intervention to protect children from the addictive nature of technology. He stated that children lack the ability to recognize the harm caused by these technologies and step away from them, hence the necessity for legislative action.

The new law will take effect on January 1, but it is expected to face legal challenges. Renner predicts that social media companies will file lawsuits immediately after the bill is signed. DeSantis also acknowledged that the law is likely to be challenged on First Amendment grounds.

In conclusion, Florida's new law, HB 3, imposes stricter regulations on children under 16 using social media platforms. It prohibits children under 14 from participating in social media and requires parental consent for 14- and 15-year-olds. The law also includes an age verification component for websites or apps containing harmful material. While the law aims to protect children, concerns have been raised regarding privacy and potential legal challenges.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/z2Rg6F0w8HnQafmU3UIBjg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NjM-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/ed2c5d80-ead7-11ee-9ded-335471c23e51,2024-03-25 19:21:16,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/can-you-hear-me-now-ai-coustics-to-fight-noisy-audio-with-generative-ai/,Can you hear me now? AI-coustics to fight noisy audio with generative AI,"Can you hear me now? AI-coustics to fight noisy audio with generative AI

Noisy recordings of interviews and speeches can be a real headache for audio engineers. But a German startup called AI-coustics believes it has found a solution using generative AI to enhance the clarity of voices in video. With €1.9 million in funding, AI-coustics is ready to tackle the challenge of poor audio quality in digital communications.

AI-coustics, co-founded by Fabian Seipel and Corvin Jaedicke, aims to make every digital interaction, from conference calls to social media videos, as clear as a professional studio broadcast. Seipel, an audio engineer, and Jaedicke, a lecturer in machine learning, met while studying audiotechnology at the Technical University of Berlin. They were frustrated by the poor audio quality they encountered in online courses and tutorials, leading them to tackle the issue of speech quality and intelligibility.

While the market for AI-powered noise-suppressing and voice-enhancing software is already quite robust, AI-coustics claims to have a unique approach to the development of AI mechanisms for noise reduction. The startup uses a model trained on speech samples recorded in their Berlin studio, which are added to the data set to train the noise-reducing model. The training process includes simulating various audio artifacts and problems, such as noise, reverberation, compression, distortion, and clipping.

One potential concern is the compensation scheme for creators who contribute their speech samples. AI-coustics offers one-time compensation, which some may argue isn't fair considering the potential long-term profitability of the AI model. Additionally, bias is a significant concern in speech recognition algorithms. To address this, AI-coustics is actively recruiting diverse speech sample contributors to eliminate bias and ensure the technology works for all languages, speaker identities, ages, accents, and genders.

To test AI-coustics' performance, three video clips were uploaded to their platform: an interview with an 18th-century farmer, a car driving demo, and an Israel-Palestine conflict protest. The processed clips showed a significant improvement in clarity, with less ambient background noise drowning out the speakers.

AI-coustics envisions its technology being used for both real-time and recorded speech enhancement. They also plan to embed it in devices like soundbars, smartphones, and headphones to automatically boost voice clarity. Currently, AI-coustics offers a web app and API for post-processing audio and video recordings, as well as an SDK for integration into existing workflows, apps, and hardware.

With five enterprise customers and 20,000 users (some paying), AI-coustics generates revenue through subscriptions, on-demand pricing, and licensing. The startup plans to expand its team and further improve its speech-enhancing model in the coming months.

AI-coustics' innovative approach to enhancing audio quality shows promise in overcoming the challenges of noisy recordings. By leveraging generative AI and focusing on diversity and inclusivity, AI-coustics aims to make digital interactions clearer and more enjoyable for everyone.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1009979808.jpg?resize=1200,801",2024-03-25 18:43:01,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-household-robots-common.html,Engineering household robots to have a little common sense,"Robots are becoming increasingly skilled at performing household tasks, from cleaning up spills to serving food. These robots are often programmed to imitate human movements, following the motions guided by a human. However, they lack the ability to handle unexpected disruptions or adjust their actions accordingly. Engineers at MIT are working on a solution to this problem by integrating robot motion data with the knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to give robots more common sense.

The researchers have developed a method that allows robots to break down complex tasks into smaller subtasks and adjust their actions when faced with disruptions. This means that robots can continue their tasks without starting from scratch or requiring explicit programming for every possible failure. The approach is aimed at improving the overall success of robotic tasks by enabling robots to self-correct errors.

Imitation learning is a commonly used approach for training household robots. However, blindly imitating human motion trajectories can lead to small errors that accumulate and ultimately disrupt the execution of the task. The new method developed by the MIT engineers allows robots to identify and correct these errors, leading to better task success.

The researchers demonstrated their approach using the task of scooping marbles from one bowl and pouring them into another. Typically, engineers would guide a robot through the motions of scooping and pouring multiple times to teach it the task. However, the team realized that a single task consists of a sequence of subtasks. For example, the robot needs to reach into the bowl before scooping and must scoop the marbles before moving to the empty bowl.

If a robot makes a mistake during any of these subtasks, it would usually have to start from the beginning. To avoid this, engineers would need to label each subtask and program or collect new demonstrations for the robot to recover from the failure. This level of planning is time-consuming and tedious.

Instead, the researchers found that language models can automatically generate a logical list of subtasks based on the text they have processed. By prompting the language model to list the actions involved in scooping marbles, for example, it can generate a sequence of verbs such as ""reach,"" ""scoop,"" ""transport,"" and ""pour."" This allows the robot to know what stage it is in the task and to replan and recover on its own.

To connect the language model's subtask labels with the robot's physical position, the team developed an algorithm that maps the robot's physical coordinates or an image of the robot's state to the natural language labels. This process, known as ""grounding,"" enables the robot to understand its position in the task and make adjustments accordingly.

The combination of robot motion data and language models provides robots with the ability to self-correct and improve their task success. This approach eliminates the need for explicit programming of every possible failure scenario, making it more efficient and scalable.

The MIT researchers will present their new approach at the International Conference on Learning Representations in May. Their work has the potential to significantly enhance the capabilities of household robots, enabling them to adapt to disruptions and improve their overall performance. With further advancements in this field, robots could become even more proficient at handling complex household tasks and providing assistance in various settings.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/engineering-household.jpg,2024-03-25 09:48:20,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-large-language-simple-mechanism-knowledge.html,Large language models use a surprisingly simple mechanism to retrieve some stored knowledge,"Large language models (LLMs) are incredibly complex tools that are used in various applications, but scientists still have limited understanding of how they work. To gain insight into their inner workings, researchers at MIT and other institutions conducted a study to examine how these models retrieve stored knowledge.

The researchers made an interesting discovery: LLMs often utilize a simple linear function to decode and retrieve stored facts. These linear functions, which involve only two variables and no exponents, capture the direct relationship between variables. Surprisingly, the model uses the same decoding function for similar types of facts.

By identifying linear functions for different facts, the researchers were able to probe the model and determine where it stores knowledge about new subjects. Even when the model provides incorrect answers, it often retains the correct information. This finding opens up possibilities for identifying and correcting falsehoods within the model, reducing the likelihood of incorrect or nonsensical responses.

Evan Hernandez, an electrical engineering and computer science graduate student at MIT and co-lead author of the study, explains, ""Even though these models are really complicated, nonlinear functions that are trained on lots of data and are very hard to understand, there are sometimes really simple mechanisms working inside them. This is one instance of that.""

Hernandez collaborated with Arnab Sharma, a computer science graduate student at Northeastern University, Jacob Andreas, an associate professor in EECS, David Bau, an assistant professor of computer science at Northeastern, and other researchers from MIT, Harvard University, and the Israeli Institute of Technology. Their findings will be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024) in Vienna.

LLMs, also known as transformer models, are neural networks that mimic the structure of the human brain. These networks consist of billions of interconnected nodes, or neurons, organized into multiple layers for encoding and processing data.

A significant portion of the knowledge stored in a transformer model can be represented as relations connecting subjects and objects. For example, the relation ""Miles Davis plays the trumpet"" connects the subject (Miles Davis) to the object (trumpet).

As a transformer model acquires more knowledge, it stores additional facts about a particular subject across its layers. When a user poses a question about that subject, the model must decode the most relevant fact to provide an accurate response.

The researchers aimed to understand the mechanism by which the model retrieves relevant facts. They conducted a series of experiments and discovered that, despite their complexity, LLMs use a simple linear function to decode relational information. Each function is tailored to the specific type of fact being retrieved.

For instance, the model would employ one decoding function to output the instrument a person plays and another function to output the state in which a person was born.

To estimate these simple functions, the researchers developed a method and calculated functions for 47 different relations, such as ""capital city of a country"" and ""lead singer of a band."" Although there are countless possible relations, the researchers focused on this specific subset to represent the types of facts that can be encoded in this manner.

The researchers tested each function by altering the subject and observing if the correct object information could still be recovered.

This study sheds light on the inner workings of LLMs and provides valuable insights into how these models retrieve and decode stored knowledge. By understanding the mechanisms at play, researchers can potentially identify and rectify falsehoods within the model, enhancing its overall accuracy and reliability. Further research in this area could lead to significant improvements in the performance of large language models.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/large-language-models-2.jpg,2024-03-25 09:34:06,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/fisker-trading-suspended-by-nyse/,Fisker trading suspended by NYSE,"The New York Stock Exchange made an announcement on Monday that it will suspend trading of electric vehicle (EV) startup Fisker's shares and seek to remove the company from its stock exchange. The NYSE stated that Fisker's stock is no longer suitable for listing due to abnormally low price levels. This decision comes after the NYSE warned Fisker a month ago that its stock price had traded below $1 for 30 consecutive days, violating the exchange's rules.

Fisker will have the opportunity to review the NYSE's determination, but the company expects its stock to be moved to an over-the-counter market such as OTC Pink. Additionally, the delisting has triggered repayment clauses in two outstanding loans that Fisker is unable to afford at the moment, which could have a significant negative impact on the business.

It has been a tumultuous day for Fisker, as its shares fell over 28% before trading was halted. Earlier in the day, Fisker announced the termination of a potential deal with a large automaker, rumored to be Nissan. This development has also put at risk a recently announced attempt to secure emergency funding.

Fisker did not provide an explanation for why the automaker terminated the negotiations, which was a crucial closing condition for a potential $150 million convertible note that was announced last week. Fisker stated in a filing that it will request the unnamed investor to waive the closing condition.

Fisker has been facing numerous challenges, including customer complaints, lawsuits, and federal investigations, for several months. The troubled EV startup has struggled to sell its Ocean SUV, falling short of its internal sales goals. In an effort to boost sales, Fisker shifted from a direct sales model to relying on dealerships. However, the company has also encountered quality issues that it has had difficulty resolving, according to internal documents.

In February, Fisker laid off 15% of its staff, which amounted to around 200 employees. Last week, the company reported having only $121 million in its bank account. Fisker has halted production and warned investors that without a fresh infusion of cash, it would not survive another year.

It is important to note that this story has been updated to include details from Fisker's SEC filing on Monday afternoon.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fisker-GettyImages.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-25 21:06:18,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/elon-musk-x-ccdh-california-lawsuit-dismissed/,A judge just killed Elon Musk's lawsuit against an anti-hate research org,"A federal judge recently made a ruling against Elon Musk and his company, dismissing a lawsuit they had filed against a nonprofit organization called the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH). The lawsuit was filed by Musk's company, referred to as X, and accused the CCDH of spreading misleading claims about hate and extremism on the platform.

In their lawsuit, X claimed that they had suffered significant financial losses as a result of the CCDH's research. They also accused the organization of illegally scraping data and violating the platform's rules by using a third-party social media monitoring tool called Brandwatch. Musk, who was personally involved in directing the lawsuit, went so far as to call the CCDH ""an evil propaganda machine"" in his replies on social media.

Last year, the CCDH filed a motion to strike X's claims under California's law against Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (SLAPP), which is designed to prevent frivolous lawsuits that aim to intimidate others. They requested that the lawsuit be dismissed, and CCDH CEO Imran Ahmed accused Musk of intentionally prolonging the legal process to increase the organization's legal expenses. 

On Monday, United States district judge Charles R. Breyer granted the CCDH's motion to dismiss the lawsuit. Breyer also denied Musk and X the opportunity to bring the case back to court. In his ruling, Breyer stated that it was clear the purpose of X's lawsuit was to punish the CCDH for criticizing X's actions and to discourage others from engaging in such criticism.

In the months following Musk's increased activity on Twitter, the CCDH drew attention to the rise of hate speech on the platform. They published a report exploring how Musk's decision to unban certain extremists could result in increased ad revenue for the company. The report specifically mentioned Andrew Anglin, a notorious neo-Nazi who created the white supremacist website the Daily Stormer.

The CCDH, established in 2018, focuses on researching hate speech, extremism, and misinformation on major social networks. Their research often reveals disturbing content across various platforms, including reports on eating disorder content on TikTok, climate denial on YouTube, and violent misogynistic threats on Instagram.

Following the judge's ruling, CCDH CEO Imran Ahmed expressed satisfaction with the outcome, emphasizing the organization's commitment to holding social media companies accountable for their decisions. He stated, ""We create costs for lies and hate."" The CCDH's legal team included Roberta Kaplan, who had recently achieved a significant victory against former President Donald Trump in the E. Jean Carroll defamation suit. Kaplan commented on the ruling, saying that it demonstrated that even the wealthiest individuals cannot manipulate the rule of law to their advantage.

While the CCDH celebrates its victory in California, Musk continues to pursue a similar lawsuit against the left-leaning media watchdog Media Matters for America. However, this lawsuit is taking place in Texas, which lacks the same legal protections against frivolous lawsuits that stifle free speech as California does.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/twitter-x-logo-musk-pattern.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-25 20:33:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/profluent-spurred-by-salesforce-research-and-backed-by-jeff-dean-uses-ai-to-discover-medicines/,"Profluent, spurred by Salesforce research and backed by Jeff Dean, uses AI to discover medicines","Last year, Salesforce initiated a project named ProGen, which utilized generative AI to design proteins. The goal of ProGen was to discover medical treatments more efficiently and at a lower cost than traditional methods. Although the project had promising research results, it didn't progress further until recently. Ali Madani, one of the researchers involved in ProGen, has now launched a company called Profluent. The company aims to bring protein-generating technology out of the lab and into the hands of pharmaceutical companies.

Profluent's mission is to ""reverse the drug development paradigm"" by starting with patient and therapeutic needs and working backwards to create customized treatments. The company plans to create AI-designed proteins that can be used as medicine for patients. Madani, who recognized the similarities between natural language and the ""language"" of proteins, believes that proteins can be treated like words in a paragraph. By inputting protein data into a generative AI model, it is possible to predict entirely new proteins with unique functions.

Profluent, co-founded by Madani and Alexander Meeske, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Washington, aims to take this concept further by applying it to gene editing. Many genetic diseases cannot be cured by proteins or enzymes derived directly from nature. Additionally, existing gene editing systems often have limitations. Profluent aims to optimize multiple attributes simultaneously to create a custom-designed gene editor that is tailored to each patient's needs.

The idea of using generative AI to predict proteins is not new. Other companies and research groups have demonstrated successful applications of generative AI in protein prediction. For example, Nvidia released a generative AI model called MegaMolBART, which was trained on a dataset of millions of molecules to search for potential drug targets. Meta trained a model called ESM-2 on protein sequences, allowing it to predict sequences for over 600 million proteins in just two weeks. DeepMind's AlphaFold system predicts complete protein structures with high speed and accuracy.

Profluent is training AI models on massive datasets containing over 40 billion protein sequences. The company aims to create new gene-editing and protein-producing systems and fine-tune existing ones. Instead of developing treatments itself, Profluent plans to collaborate with external partners to create ""genetic medicines"" that have the highest chances of approval. Madani believes that this approach could significantly reduce the time and capital required to develop new treatments. Currently, it takes an average of 10-15 years to develop a new medicine, with costs ranging from several hundred million to $2.8 billion.

Profluent, based in Berkeley and consisting of 20 employees, has received funding from prominent venture capital firms such as Spark Capital, Insight Partners, Air Street Capital, AIX Ventures, and Convergent Ventures. Google's chief scientist, Jeff Dean, has also contributed to the company. Profluent's immediate focus will be on enhancing its AI models by expanding the training datasets and acquiring customers and partners. The company faces competition from other players in the field, such as EvolutionaryScale and Basecamp Research, who are also developing protein-generating models and securing significant investments.

Madani believes that Profluent has made scientific breakthroughs in gene editing and is now ready to scale its platform and collaborate with partners to achieve its ambitious goals for the future. With its innovative approach and support from notable investors, Profluent has the potential to revolutionize the field of drug development and bring personalized genetic medicines to patients more efficiently and effectively.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1288172035.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-25 22:08:51,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/bankrupt-ev-startup-arrival-sold-its-assets-to-canoo/,Bankrupt EV startup Arrival sold its assets to Canoo,"Bankrupt electric vehicle (EV) startup Arrival has sold some of its assets, including advanced manufacturing equipment, to struggling startup Canoo. The acquisition is seen as a cost-saving measure for Canoo, which is trying to move beyond prototypes and into commercial production. Canoo plans to send the purchased assets to its facility in Oklahoma. It remains uncertain if Canoo also acquired any of Arrival's intellectual property (IP). Arrival, once valued at over $13 billion and backed by Hyundai and UPS, filed for bankruptcy protection in the UK and announced plans to sell off assets and IP from its UK division. Arrival's goal of revolutionizing EV production by building compact ""microfactories"" in city centers fell apart as the company faced financial difficulties and executive turnover. Canoo, which went public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, has also faced challenges in producing its EV. The company has a sales pipeline of over $1 billion but has struggled to convert sales into deliveries. Canoo has resorted to stock splits and issuing more shares to sustain itself.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/canoo-walmart-arkansas.jpg?resize=1200,670",2024-03-25 22:15:20,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/match-board-directors-after-talks-activist-investor-elliott-management/,Match appoints two board directors after talks with activist investor Elliott Management,"Tinder-owner Match Group recently made some significant changes to its board of directors and formed a partnership with Elliott Management, an activist investor. The company announced on Monday that Laura Jones, the Chief Marketing Officer at Instacart, and Spencer Rascoff, co-founder of Zillow, will be joining the board immediately.

According to Match, these appointments came after a productive conversation with Elliott Management, resulting in an ""information-sharing"" agreement between the two companies. This news comes a few months after The Wall Street Journal reported that Elliott had acquired a stake worth around $1 billion in Match Group. The report suggested that Elliott was interested in discussing strategies to improve Match's performance, given the decline in paying users amid economic uncertainty.

Marc Steinberg, a partner at Elliott, expressed confidence in Match Group's potential for value creation as the global leader in online dating. He stated that the collaboration with management and the board has been positive and emphasized the strength that Laura Jones and Spencer Rascoff will bring as new board members. Elliott Management is known for acquiring stakes in tech companies and influencing changes, as seen in previous board shakeups at Crown Castle and Etsy.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, Match experienced a 5% decrease in the number of total paid users compared to the previous year, with 15.2 million users. The company's growth has slowed down from the heights it reached during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a 79% decline in stock price since its peak in 2021.

Match Group is the parent company of several popular dating apps, including Tinder, Hinge, Match.com, Meetic, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, and OurTime. These apps have gained significant popularity among users seeking romantic connections.

With the recent changes in its board and the partnership with Elliott Management, Match Group aims to navigate its next phase of growth and address the challenges it faces in the online dating industry. The company is optimistic about the future and remains committed to providing innovative and engaging dating experiences for its users worldwide.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1241790742.jpeg?w=1024,2024-03-25 14:15:04,Innovation,Innovation
