Noisy recordings of interviews and speeches can be incredibly frustrating for audio engineers. However, a German startup called AI-coustics aims to solve this problem using generative AI technology to enhance the clarity of voices in videos.

Today, AI-coustics has emerged from stealth mode with €1.9 million in funding. According to co-founder and CEO Fabian Seipel, AI-coustics' technology goes beyond standard noise suppression and can work with any device and speaker.

""Our core mission is to make every digital interaction, whether it's a conference call, consumer device, or casual social media video, as clear as a broadcast from a professional studio,"" Seipel explained in an interview with TechCrunch.

Seipel, who is an audio engineer by training, co-founded AI-coustics with Corvin Jaedicke, a lecturer in machine learning at the Technical University of Berlin, in 2021. They both encountered poor audio quality in the online courses and tutorials they had to take while studying audiotechnology at TU Berlin.

""We've been driven by a personal mission to overcome the pervasive challenge of poor audio quality in digital communications,"" Seipel said. ""While my hearing is slightly impaired from music production in my early twenties, I've always struggled with online content and lectures, which led us to work on the speech quality and intelligibility topic in the first place.""

The market for AI-powered noise-suppressing and voice-enhancing software is already quite robust. AI-coustics' competitors include Insoundz, which uses generative AI to enhance streamed and pre-recorded speech clips, and Veed.io, a video editing suite with tools to remove background noise from clips.

However, AI-coustics claims to have a unique approach to developing the AI mechanisms that perform the noise reduction work. The startup uses a model trained on speech samples recorded in its Berlin-based studio. People are paid to record these samples, which are then added to a data set to train AI-coustics' noise-reducing model.

""We developed a unique approach to simulate audio artifacts and problems—such as noise, reverberation, compression, band-limited microphones, distortion, clipping, and so on—during the training process,"" Seipel explained.

While AI-coustics' compensation scheme for creators might raise some concerns, the startup is focused on recruiting diverse speech sample contributors to combat biases. Seipel believes that size and diversity are essential for eliminating bias and ensuring the technology works for all languages, speaker identities, ages, accents, and genders.

To test the effectiveness of AI-coustics' technology, I uploaded three video clips—an interview with an 18th-century farmer, a car driving demo, and an Israel-Palestine conflict protest—to the platform. The processed clips had significantly less ambient background noise, making the speakers' voices clearer.

Seipel envisions AI-coustics' technology being used for real-time speech enhancement as well as recorded speech. It could even be embedded in devices like soundbars, smartphones, and headphones to automatically boost voice clarity. Currently, AI-coustics offers a web app and API for post-processing audio and video recordings, as well as an SDK for integrating its platform into existing workflows, apps, and hardware.

AI-coustics currently has five enterprise customers and approximately 20,000 users. The startup generates revenue through subscriptions, on-demand pricing, and licensing. In the coming months, the company plans to expand its team and improve the underlying speech-enhancing model.

""Prior to our initial investment, AI-coustics ran a lean operation with a low burn rate to survive the difficulties of the VC investment market,"" Seipel said. ""Now, AI-coustics has a substantial network of investors and mentors in Germany and the U.K. for advice.""","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1009979808.jpg?resize=1200,801",2024-03-25 18:43:01,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/fisker-nissan-deal-dead-funding-bankruptcy/,"Fisker loses potential Nissan deal, putting rescue funds at risk","The negotiations between Fisker and a large automaker, which is rumored to be Nissan, have come to an abrupt end. This development not only puts a potential investment and collaboration at risk but also jeopardizes a near-term rescue funding effort. Fisker made this announcement in a regulatory filing on Monday, revealing that the automaker terminated the negotiations on March 22. However, Fisker did not provide a reason for this decision.

It is worth noting that Fisker had to continue the negotiations as part of the closing conditions for a potential $150 million convertible note that was announced the previous week. In response to the termination of the negotiations, Fisker plans to ask the unnamed investor to waive the closing condition. Unfortunately, the news of the terminated negotiations had an immediate impact on Fisker's stock, causing it to plummet by 28%. As a result, trading was halted.

This latest setback is just one in a series of challenges faced by the electric vehicle (EV) startup. Fisker has encountered difficulties in selling its Ocean SUV, failing to meet its own internal sales goals. This underperformance has forced the company to shift away from a direct sales model. Furthermore, Fisker has been plagued by quality problems with some of the cars that have been delivered. These issues have proven to be challenging for the company to resolve, as revealed by internal documents.

To add to its troubles, Fisker recently laid off 15% of its workforce, which amounts to approximately 200 employees. In addition, the company disclosed that it has only $121 million in its bank account. With production temporarily halted, Fisker has warned investors that it would not survive another year without a significant infusion of cash. While Fisker has held talks with other automakers, including Mazda, it appears that only Nissan remained engaged in negotiations until recently.

Despite these setbacks, Fisker remains determined to explore other options. The company announced on Monday that it is considering various ""strategic alternatives"" to the potential tie-up with Nissan. These alternatives include in or out of court restructurings, capital market transactions (subject to market conditions), repurchases, redemptions, exchanges, or other refinancings of existing debt, the potential issuance of equity securities, the potential sale of assets and businesses, and/or other strategic transactions and measures.

In summary, Fisker's negotiations with a large automaker, believed to be Nissan, have been terminated, posing a significant risk to a potential investment and collaboration. The EV startup has faced numerous challenges, including underperforming sales, quality problems with its vehicles, layoffs, and a dwindling bank account. Despite these difficulties, Fisker is exploring alternative options to secure its future. The company is evaluating various strategic alternatives and remains determined to find a viable solution.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1236611991.jpg?resize=1200,759",2024-03-25 13:52:11,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/profluent-spurred-by-salesforce-research-and-backed-by-jeff-dean-uses-ai-to-discover-medicines/,"Profluent, spurred by Salesforce research and backed by Jeff Dean, uses AI to discover medicines","Last year, Salesforce, known for its cloud sales support software, launched a project called ProGen to develop proteins using generative AI. The project aimed to uncover medical treatments more efficiently than traditional methods. ProGen successfully created the 3D structures of artificial proteins, as published in the journal Nature Biotech. However, it did not progress beyond the research stage. Now, one of the researchers involved, Ali Madani, has founded a company called Profluent to bring protein-generating technology to pharmaceutical companies. Profluent's mission is to reverse the drug development process by creating custom-fit treatments based on patient and therapeutic needs.

Madani drew parallels between natural language and the ""language"" of proteins while working at Salesforce's research division. Proteins can be treated like words in a paragraph, and generative AI models can predict entirely new proteins with unique functions. Profluent aims to take this concept further by applying it to gene editing. Many genetic diseases cannot be fixed by natural proteins, and current gene editing systems have limitations. Profluent can optimize multiple attributes simultaneously to create custom-designed gene editors for each patient.

Other companies and research groups have also demonstrated the use of generative AI in predicting proteins. Nvidia released a generative AI model called MegaMolBART, which searched for potential drug targets and predicted chemical reactions. Meta trained a model called ESM-2 to predict protein sequences. DeepMind's AlphaFold predicts complete protein structures with remarkable speed and accuracy.

Profluent is training AI models on massive data sets, including over 40 billion protein sequences, to develop new gene-editing and protein-producing systems. The startup plans to collaborate with external partners to create genetic medicines with the most promising paths to approval. This approach could significantly reduce the time and capital required for treatment development, which currently takes 10-15 years on average and costs several hundred million to billions of dollars.

Profluent, based in Berkeley, is backed by notable venture capital firms such as Spark Capital, Insight Partners, and Air Street Capital. Google chief scientist Jeff Dean has also contributed to the platform. The company's focus in the coming months is to enhance its AI models by expanding training data sets and acquiring customers and partners. Competitors like EvolutionaryScale and Basecamp Research are also developing their own protein-generating models and securing substantial VC funding.

Profluent has laid the foundation for its platform and achieved scientific breakthroughs in gene editing. Now, the company aims to scale up and collaborate with partners to realize its ambitions for the future.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1288172035.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-25 22:08:51,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewwight/2024/03/25/how-are-scientists-saving-colombias-delicious-native-palm-species/,How Are Scientists Saving Colombia’s Delicious Native Palm Species,"Colombia, a country known for its rich biodiversity, is facing the challenge of preserving its palm species. With over 260 species of palms, Colombia ranks third in the world. However, more than 200 of these species are at risk of extinction. Among them, the Taparo palm and the Chontaduro, also known as the peach palm, hold cultural and economic significance in the central and southern regions of the country.

To address this issue, Alberto Gomez Mejia, a botanist and founder of the Quindio Botanical Garden, is leading efforts to establish a gene bank to protect the genetic diversity of these palms. His team aims to reintroduce these species into the wild and develop sustainable commercial plantations. They are also collaborating with local communities to collect population data and study the reproduction of these palms in their natural habitat in the central Andes of Colombia.

Gomez Mejia's passion for conservation began in an unconventional way. After studying law and teaching philosophy, he became interested in ecology in 1972, following the Stockholm Conference on the human environment. This newfound interest led him to become a university professor and later the mayor of Armenia, earning him the nickname of the ""Ecologist Mayor."" Throughout his career, he has attended numerous national and international events on conservation, emphasizing the importance of harnessing the biological diversity of the Global South.

Colombia is home to many undiscovered plant species, some of which are at risk of extinction due to human activities such as roadside maintenance and the decline of Andean forests. Laura Clavijo, an assistant professor at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia, and her team have recently discovered a new plant species called Glossolomamagenticristatum. This species is threatened by periodic disturbance caused by roadside vegetation removal and the overall decline of Andean forests due to colonization and agriculture. Clavijo emphasizes the need to understand Colombia's biodiversity, its distribution, and the factors influencing its evolution in order to develop effective conservation and management strategies.

Preserving Colombia's palm species and other unique plant species is vital not only for their cultural and economic value but also for the overall health of the ecosystem. Colombia's flora holds untapped potential for food, medicine, handicrafts, and ornamental plants. By promoting education and knowledge about these plants, the country can unlock their nutritional and economic benefits while ensuring their long-term survival.

In conclusion, Colombia's palm species, including the Taparo palm and the Chontaduro, face the threat of extinction. Efforts led by Alberto Gomez Mejia and other researchers aim to protect these species by establishing gene banks, reintroducing them into the wild, and promoting sustainable commercial plantations. Additionally, the discovery of new plant species highlights the need for conservation and management strategies to safeguard Colombia's rich biodiversity. By harnessing the potential of its flora, Colombia can enhance food security, promote economic growth, and preserve its natural heritage for future generations.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660196dcec2b8dcfcc90103a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 18:24:36,Innovation,Innovation

The company announced on Monday that it has appointed two new members to its board of directors and signed an agreement with Elliott Management, an activist investor. Laura Jones, the Chief Marketing Officer at Instacart, and Spencer Rascoff, the co-founder of Zillow, will be joining the board with immediate effect.

According to Match, these appointments are a result of a ""constructive dialogue"" with Elliott Management, and the two companies have entered into an ""information-sharing"" agreement. This news comes a few months after The Wall Street Journal reported that Elliott Management had acquired a stake of around $1 billion in Match Group. The report suggested that Elliott was interested in discussing ways for Match to improve its performance, as the company has been facing a decline in paying users due to economic uncertainty.

Marc Steinberg, a partner at Elliott Management, expressed his confidence in Match Group's potential for value creation as the global leader in online dating. He stated, ""We are one of the largest investors of Match Group today because we believe in its opportunity for significant value creation as the global leader in online dating. We appreciate the collaboration with management and the Board over the past several months, and we are confident that Laura Jones and Spencer Rascoff are strong additions to the Board. We believe their unique skills and perspectives will help support the Company through its next phase of growth.""

Elliott Management is known for acquiring stakes in tech companies and pushing for changes. This move to bring about change at Match Group follows similar actions taken by Elliott at Crown Castle and Etsy, where board shakeups were implemented.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, Match Group experienced a 5% decline in the number of total paid users compared to the previous year, with 15.2 million users. The company's growth has slowed down from the heights it reached during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a 79% decline in its stock value from its peak in 2021.

Match Group is the parent company of various well-known dating apps, including Tinder, Hinge, Match.com, Meetic, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, OurTime, and more. These apps have gained popularity worldwide, making Match Group a dominant player in the online dating industry.

The appointment of Laura Jones and Spencer Rascoff to Match Group's board of directors and the partnership with Elliott Management represent significant developments for the company.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/gostudent-tutoring-profitability/,"GoStudent, the online learning platform, says it's now profitable","GoStudent, an online tutoring marketplace based in Vienna, Austria, has become one of the most successful startups in the country. With 11 million families and 23,000 tutors on the platform, GoStudent has now achieved profitability. According to CEO Felix Ohswald, the company is not just EBITDA profitable, but also has positive operating cash flow. GoStudent is one of the few Austrian startups to gain recognition on the international tech scene, alongside Bitpanda and Runtastic.

However, the road to profitability has not been easy for GoStudent. Like many other technology companies, it faced challenges during the online learning boom caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Cash burn became a major issue, and customer demand dropped off significantly. In 2021, the company lost €89 million, which increased to €220 million in 2022. This led to layoffs and cost cuts.

GoStudent experienced rapid growth from 2019 to 2022, scaling its core business model to over €100 million in revenue. However, it also had a cash burn of over €150 million in 2022 alone. As the markets changed, the company realized it couldn't continue on that path. In 2023, it reduced its burn rate by 70%, but it still wasn't enough. Restructurings and layoffs were necessary to ensure future growth.

The COVID-19 pandemic brought about a digital transformation, especially in the education technology (edtech) sector. GoStudent went from having to convince parents about the benefits of online tutoring to becoming a go-to solution for students needing educational help. However, despite its success, the company needed to address its cash burn issue. It made cuts to expenses such as parties and acquisitions, and focused on established online tutoring markets in Europe.

GoStudent's future growth strategy will be more organic, with a focus on Europe. It has shifted its priorities from top-line growth to bottom-line growth. The company's goal is to build the number one global school and unlock the potential of every student through personalized tutoring. It acquired Studienkreis in 2022, a company with physical learning centers, to expand its hybrid learning approach. GoStudent believes that the future of education is hybrid, combining technology with physical learning centers to provide personalized tutoring regardless of location.

Most of GoStudent's tutors are university students, which allows them to connect easily with pupils while providing quality tutoring. The company is committed to ensuring each student finds the right tutor for their needs. With its focus on profitability and growth, GoStudent is poised to continue making a significant impact in the edtech industry.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Founders-of-GoStudent-Gregor-Muller-I-Felix-Ohswald-2.jpg?w=1024,2024-03-25 11:00:36,Innovation,Innovation

It's almost the end of March, and what a strange month it has been. Winter has been holding on tightly, not allowing spring to take its place. Today, the sun is shining and the snow is melting, but we are expecting more snow over the Easter weekend. And then, the day after Easter is April Fool's Day, a day that I personally don't enjoy. It's best to stay offline that day to avoid any pranks.

Ironically, it was on April Fool's Day that I managed to solve my first Wordle puzzle with just one guess. I guessed ""march"" because if I were playing an April Fool's prank in the style of Wordle, I would choose another month with five letters that is not just a proper noun (since ""April"" is a proper noun and cannot be the answer).

Speaking of proper nouns, yesterday's Wordle puzzle really confused me!

Now, let's get to today's Wordle puzzle.

How to Solve Today's Wordle

The hint for today's Wordle puzzle is ""politician.""

The clue is that today's Wordle word ends with a consonant.

Wordle Analysis

Every day, I check Wordle Bot to see how well I did. You can check your Wordles with Wordle Bot as well.

I was so confident with my third guess, only to be disappointed when the third box turned grey. Oh well, that's life! My initial guess was close, but not quite there. I had 196 words left and only one yellow ""O."" I reduced that to 11 and gained two more yellow letters. I played around with them and eventually settled on ""major"" because out of all the words I could think of, two had the letter ""M"" in them. Unfortunately, it turned out to be ""mayor"" and not ""major"" that was the answer to today's Wordle.

Competitive Wordle Score

I lose 1 point because the Bot solved this puzzle in just three guesses (""crane,"" ""tyros,"" ""mayor"" - really, ""tyros""?) and I get 0 points for guessing in four. So, my total score is -1. Sigh.

Today's Wordle Etymology

The word ""mayor"" comes from the Old French word ""maire,"" which means ""head of a city or town government."" This word originated from the Latin word ""maior,"" which means ""greater"" or ""superior."" In Latin, it was used in the title ""maior domus"" or ""major domo,"" which means ""chief steward"" of a noble house, indicating a position of authority and oversight. Over time, ""maior"" transformed into various forms in Romance languages and eventually became ""mayor"" in English. The role of a mayor as the leader of a city or municipal government reflects the historical meaning of being a superior or chief official within a local jurisdiction.

Originally intended to be projected on four walls and enclose the audience, the presentation on three big screens still managed to create an immersive experience. Powered by Stable Diffusion, a local version of the text to image generator, the triptych of The Golden Key automatically generated themed images based on unrelated short fairy tales. Guests had the opportunity to add their own prompts and witness them come to life in real-time. The concept of The Golden Key is mind-blowing, and I can only imagine how incredible it would be in its original four-walled form. The lightning-fast version of Stable Diffusion generated captivating images from fairy tales, while guests added their own twists to the evolving narrative.

The Golden Key felt like a whole new medium unfolding right before our eyes. Directed by Marc Da Costa and Matthew Niederhauser, this piece was a revelation and offered an entirely new experience. It is discoveries like these that make me return to SXSW year after year. Da Costa and Niederhauser also presented Tulpamancer, which received an award at the Venice Film Festival last year. In Tulpamancer, participants interact with a tulpa, a thought form or imaginary friend, through a retro computer terminal. They answer a series of questions about their own lives and are then invited to meet their tulpa in a uniquely prepared virtual world. Wearing a VR headset, participants embark on a journey guided by their tulpa, exploring virtual scenes that evoke memories and question their own past and future.

Among the notable projects in the XR experience area, Soul Paint, created by Sarah Ticho and directed by Sarah Ticho and Niki Smit, received a Special Jury Award. This project, produced by Anna Firbank, stood out for its unique storytelling. Another impressive experience was Astra by Eliza McKnitt, set in space like her previous award-winning XR experience, Spheres. Additionally, Impulse, which shed light on the experiences of individuals with ADHD, showcased an innovative use of mixed reality, blending real and digital elements using outward-facing HD cameras.

Reimagined Volume III: Young Thang, produced by a female-led team in partnership with Meta, brings a new kind of storybook to life in VR animation. This anthology series showcases lesser-known fables, mythology, and folklore, offering a fresh perspective on storytelling. Shadowtime, another Venice selection, presents a poetic contemplation of escapism and real-world threats, including Climate Change. Detachment, a satiric VR experience from Ristband, known for their multidimensional mixed reality concerts, also deserves an honorable mention. It takes viewers on a cinematic journey following a voice-over actor as they navigate the programming of a script.

Ristband made their return to SXSW in 2024 with their SXSW Official Future x Music event, featuring an ambisonic A/V installation, a critically acclaimed mixed reality concert by the band Pivots, and performances from international artists Glasser, Moritz Simon Geist, Minimal Schlager, and Kikuo. Blending game design, cinema, virtual reality, live performance, and generative AI visuals with ambisonic audio, Ristband showcased the innovative ways artists are leveraging technology to unlock their creative potential.

Chris Madsen, Senior Sales Engineer for VR Metaverse Engage, described the event as a ""transformative, immersive journey between the physical and the digital."" Using Pico Neo 4E mixed reality headsets, attendees were transported between physical reality and fully immersive virtual dreamscapes, creating a shift in consciousness and a fantastical experience.

The SXSW XR exhibition was filled with groundbreaking and awe-inspiring projects that pushed the boundaries of storytelling and immersive experiences. From Stable Diffusion's creation of themed images based on fairy tales to the transformative journeys offered by Tulpamancer and Astra, these projects showcased the power of technology in creating new and captivating narratives. Soul Paint, Reimagined Volume III: Young Thang, Shadowtime, and Detachment offered unique perspectives and storytelling approaches, capturing the imagination of the audience. Ristband's Future x Music event demonstrated the fusion of music, video, and games, creating an immersive and multisensory experience for attendees. Overall, the XR exhibition at SXSW 2024 was a testament to the endless possibilities of technology in the realm of storytelling and immersive art.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660200d15ac92b36fd540aa5/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=937,527,x48,y0,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 18:57:26,Innovation,Innovation
