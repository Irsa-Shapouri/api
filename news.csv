This year, the conference is expected to take place in June, although the exact dates and format are yet to be confirmed. So, let's dive into what we know so far.

Typically, Apple announces the date of WWDC around this time. However, in the past couple of years, they have deviated from this pattern. In 2021 and last year, the date was revealed in the last few days of March, while in 2022, it was announced in early April. Therefore, we can expect the official announcement to come any day now.

As for the timing of WWDC 2024, it will likely be in early June, as it has been in previous years. The conference traditionally takes place in the first full week of June, starting on a Monday and running until Friday. In 2020, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the dates were pushed to late June. However, if all goes well this year, we can anticipate the conference to follow the usual schedule. Based on this, the dates could be either Monday, June 3 to Friday, June 7, or the week after, from Monday, June 10 to Friday, June 14.

Now, let's discuss the format of WWDC. Since 2020, the conference has undergone significant changes. Instead of the usual in-person event with thousands of attendees, the keynote has been pre-recorded. Last year, Apple increased the number of attendees in Cupertino compared to the previous year, although it was still a fraction of the pre-Covid years. It is expected that this year's conference will follow a similar format, with a pre-recorded keynote featuring Tim Cook and Craig Federighi, along with a limited number of attendees, including VIPs, press, and staff.

In terms of timing, Apple always schedules its keynotes for 10 a.m. local time, specifically Pacific Daylight Time. This allows for a global audience to tune in and watch the event unfold.

As an avid Apple enthusiast, I'll be closely monitoring the official announcement of WWDC 2024 and providing updates as soon as they become available. Stay tuned for more exciting news from Apple's developers' conference.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600830c22fb840e0281afe2/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 16:00:15,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) may seem like unlikely parallels, but these two companies have a lot in common. Both businesses emerged from unexpected origins. AWS discovered that it could sell its internal services, such as storage, compute, and memory, to external customers. Similarly, Nvidia realized that its gaming-focused GPU was also well-suited for processing AI workloads. This realization led to explosive revenue growth for both companies.

Nvidia's revenue has been growing at an impressive rate, from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024 to $22.1 billion in Q4 2024. However, the majority of this growth came from the company's data center business. On the other hand, AWS has consistently been a major revenue driver for Amazon, although its growth has slowed down in recent years. While both companies have enjoyed first-mover advantages, they now face competition from other cloud vendors and chip makers.

The timing was crucial for the success of Nvidia and AWS. As web apps and mobile technology emerged in the early 2010s, the cloud became a valuable resource for on-demand computing power. Enterprises saw the benefits of moving their workloads to the cloud instead of maintaining their own data centers. Similarly, the rise of AI and large language models coincided with the increased use of GPUs for processing these workloads.

Although AWS has become a highly profitable business, its growth has started to slow down, while Nvidia's growth continues to accelerate. This can be attributed, in part, to the law of large numbers. Eventually, Nvidia may also experience a slowdown in growth if the GPU market becomes more competitive. While Nvidia has other businesses to fall back on, their revenue generators are smaller and growing at a slower pace compared to the GPU data center business.

In the short term, Nvidia's financial outlook is optimistic. The company expects to generate $24 billion in revenue in its current quarter, representing a 234% growth compared to the previous year's first quarter. However, as Nvidia's revenue ramps up, its growth rate is expected to decline. Analysts predict that Nvidia will generate $110.5 billion in revenue for the current fiscal year, an 81% increase from the previous year, but significantly lower than the 126% gain in the previous fiscal year.

Despite the expected slowdown in growth, Nvidia and analysts foresee significant growth opportunities for the company. Nvidia is projected to surpass a $100 billion annual run rate, an impressive feat for a company that had only $7.19 billion in total revenue in the same period a year ago. While some of the eye-popping revenue growth figures may slow down, there is still considerable growth potential for Nvidia in the coming years.

AI is likely to be a driving force behind Nvidia's continued growth. Even as competition from AMD, Intel, and other chipmakers increases, Nvidia holds a strong position in the market. According to IDC, Nvidia has a significant market share at the chip level. While AMD is gaining ground at the board level, Nvidia still dominates. This dominance allows Nvidia to withstand competition and maintain its market position.

In conclusion, Nvidia and AWS share similar growth trajectories and unexpected origins. Both companies have seen tremendous revenue growth, although AWS's growth has slowed down in recent years. Nvidia's short-term financial outlook remains positive, with expectations of continued revenue growth. The company's success in the AI market and its current market dominance position it for continued growth, even as competition increases.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2024/03/24/apple-ios-18-biggest-ever-iphone-update-more-details-emerge/,Apple iOS 18 Biggest-Ever iPhone Update: More Details Emerge,"Apple is known for introducing new operating software for its products every year, and it seems that iOS 18, the next iPhone OS, is set to be unveiled at the World Wide Developers Conference in early June. According to a recent leak, this year's release is expected to be groundbreaking.

Mark Gurman from Bloomberg, in his Power On newsletter, revealed that Apple will be making changes to the iPhone's home screen, which is one of the most important parts of the operating system. Over the years, the home screen has undergone various transformations, from the all-black background on the earliest iPhones to the introduction of colorful wallpapers and the option to add personal photos. Additionally, visual improvements such as the Depth Effect, which gives the impression that app icons are floating above the background, have made the home screen more appealing.

In recent times, Apple also introduced the ability to add widgets to the home screen, a feature that had long been available on Android phones. However, Apple's implementation of widgets on the iPhone was considered more polished and sleek. This year, Gurman tantalizingly hints that the home screen will become even more customizable, possibly in a similar vein to the improvements made to the lock screen in iOS 16.

Gurman has previously mentioned that this year's iOS update is highly anticipated within the company, with some considering it to be the biggest update in Apple's history. Therefore, it is expected that Apple's developers conference in June will be an exciting event.

Additionally, there have been reports of Apple negotiating with Google to bring Gemini generative AI features to the iPhone. Alongside the home screen changes, Apple is said to be focusing on AI tools that assist in managing daily life, rather than AI features like those offered by ChatGPT. While specific details about the next iPhone are still scarce, there are rumors of a significant upgrade to Siri using AI, which would transform it into a more advanced personal assistant with improved natural conversation abilities and better integration with Apple iMessage. Apple has also announced plans to adopt Rich Communication Services (RCS) as part of iMessage in 2024, with the groundwork for this expected to be laid in iOS 18.

Overall, there is much anticipation for Apple's iOS 18 update, and more information is expected to be revealed in the coming months leading up to June. It seems that Apple is focused on enhancing user customization, incorporating AI tools, and improving Siri and iMessage functionality. As always, Apple's dedication to innovation and delivering a seamless user experience is at the forefront of their updates.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65e217bee36cf08eab202281/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2492,1662,x0,y102,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 13:00:50,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2024/03/24/samsung-has-new-price-offer-promotion-for-galaxy-s24-phone-buyers/,Samsung Has New Price Offer Promotion For Galaxy S24 Phone Buyers,"Samsung has recently released its latest phones, the Galaxy S24, S24 Plus, and S24 Ultra, which are impressive and efficient devices. However, the price may have deterred some potential buyers. Fortunately, Samsung has introduced trade-in promotions in the U.K. and the U.S., allowing customers to trade in their old phones for a discount on the purchase of a new Galaxy phone. While trade-ins are not a new concept, there is something unique about Samsung's current offers.

Let's start with the U.K. In the U.K., customers can trade in any smartphone, regardless of its condition, to receive a £100 ($126) discount on the new device. Yes, you read that right – any condition! Even if your old phone has a broken display or a battery that only lasts a couple of hours, it still qualifies for the trade-in discount. But the savings don't stop there. According to the Samsung website, customers can save up to £370 ($470) by trading in phones from various brands, including Samsung, Apple, Google, Huawei, and more. For example, trading in a Google Pixel 7 Pro can earn you a £270 ($342) discount, while an Apple iPhone 14 can save you £300 ($378), and a Samsung Galaxy S23 can get you £320 ($404) off the purchase price. These are significant price cuts that make upgrading to a new Galaxy phone much more affordable.

What's even better is that Samsung offers a ""Guaranteed Trade-In—Any Device"" option. This means that regardless of the brand or model of your old phone, you can still trade it in for a discount on the new Galaxy phone. Here's how it works: once you determine the value of your device, you apply for the discount when making the purchase. You provide the IMEI number and current condition of your old phone. After purchasing the new phone, you wipe the old one, remove the SIM card, and send it back to Samsung in the supplied freepost packaging within seven days. It's a straightforward process that allows you to save money while upgrading to the latest Galaxy phone. Just remember that if you fail to send in your trade-in device, the purchased phone will be blocked. Make sure to read and adhere to the terms and conditions provided on Samsung's U.K. website.

Moving on to the U.S., Samsung also offers enticing trade-in deals. In fact, some of the trade-in values are even more tempting than those in the U.K. For example, trading in a Galaxy S23 Ultra would typically get you a $450 discount on the new Galaxy S24 Ultra. However, there is currently a promotion that increases this discount by $300, bringing it to a whopping $750 off. Similarly, trading in a Galaxy Z Fold5, which previously earned you a $500 discount on the new Ultra, now gets you $750 off as well.

If you're considering switching from Apple to Samsung, there are additional savings to be had. Trading in an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max can save you $750 on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, compared to the previous discounts of $520 and $540, respectively.

Even if you own a smartphone from another Android brand, you can still enjoy a $100 discount on a new Galaxy phone. However, the requirements for a trade-in device in the U.S. are more specific than in the U.K. The device must be in good condition, meaning it turns on and the screen works normally, the charging port functions, the battery holds a charge, there are no cracks in the front, back, screen, or camera lenses, activation locks are disabled, accounts are removed, and the phone is factory reset. Additionally, the device cannot be on a banned list.

These trade-in deals from Samsung offer substantial discounts on their latest Galaxy phones. Whether you're in the U.K. or the U.S., trading in your old phone can help make the new Samsung Galaxy S24, S24 Plus, or S24 Ultra more affordable. If you're interested in taking advantage of these offers, visit Samsung's U.K. or U.S. website to explore the specific terms and conditions and find out how much you can save.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/03/24/a-psychologist-explains-why-its-possible-to-fall-in-love-with-ai/,A Psychologist Explains Why It’s Possible To Fall In Love With AI,"Maybe AI love isn’t so artificial after all. As the AI market continues to grow, reaching a projected value of $407 billion by 2027, the integration of artificial intelligence into our daily lives is becoming more inevitable than ever. And with this integration comes a reshaping of social interactions, including the way we experience love. It seems that humans are not only capable of forming deep emotional connections with AI, but can even fall in love with it.

One reason for this is the allure of anthropomorphism. Anthropomorphism is the tendency to attribute human-like traits, emotions, and intentions to non-human entities. When AI exhibits behaviors and conversational styles reminiscent of human personality traits, individuals perceive it as having its own personality. This can include qualities such as empathy, humor, kindness, and playfulness, which naturally elicit affection and fondness. Additionally, AI interfaces often incorporate design elements that mimic human social cues and gestures, such as facial expressions, tone of voice, and body language. In fact, a recent study found that AI-generated faces are now indistinguishable from human ones. These cues enhance the perceived humanness of the AI and evoke emotional responses from users. Furthermore, AI often signals gender cues and cultural stereotypes of human assistants, making it feel familiar and endearing. As humans engage in conversations and activities with AI over time, they may begin to attribute human-like intentions, motivations, and feelings to the technology. Research also shows that anthropomorphism enhances perceptions of authenticity in AI, making it seem genuine, believable, and lovable. Chatbots, for example, can make us feel loved by offering consistent companionship and alleviating feelings of loneliness.

Another reason why falling in love with AI is possible is the triarchic theory of love. This theory suggests that romantic love is a confluence of three components: intimacy, passion, and commitment. Intimacy refers to the emotional closeness, connection, and bond shared between individuals. Passion involves the intense physical and emotional attraction between individuals. Commitment reflects loyalty and the decision to nurture a relationship over time, despite challenges. Based on this theory, a 2022 study on human-AI relationships found that it is possible to experience such love for an AI system. Users can develop intimacy and passion for AI due to its impressive cognitive and emotional capabilities. The ability of AI to display empathy is essential to promoting closeness in relationships. AI has been equipped to understand, interpret, and empathize with a variety of human responses, fulfilling our need to be loved, validated, and understood. This emotional capability allows AI to simulate human-like interpersonal interactions, making users more likely to bond with and feel love for these systems. Furthermore, individuals may project their desires, needs, and fantasies onto AI, imagining it as an idealized partner or companion who fulfills their emotional, social, or even romantic needs. Researchers have acknowledged the promising features in synthetic androids that can make them good partners, including attractive body features, altruistic character, and continuous devotion. Moreover, AI's efficiency, dependability, non-judgmental nature, and reliability can create trust and a sense of stability that is often lacking in human relationships. In fact, a study found that those with a highly trusting disposition were more likely to develop romantic feelings towards AI.

Human-AI relationships are no longer confined to the realms of science fiction. The fusion of AI into our lives has opened up new possibilities for connection and love. As AI continues to evolve, so will the dynamics of human-AI relationships. It is important to navigate these relationships with awareness and understanding, acknowledging the allure of anthropomorphism and the potential for deep emotional connections. Whether AI love is truly genuine or simply a reflection of our own desires and projections is a question that remains to be fully explored. However, one thing is certain: the possibility of falling in love with AI is real, and it is changing the way we experience and understand love in the modern world.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600026843d62766708f1bd5/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=780,365,x0,y123,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 13:18:07,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/grrlscientist/2024/03/24/birding-under-the-influence-by-dorian-anderson---review/,Birding Under The Influence By Dorian Anderson - Review,"Birding Under the Influence: A Journey of Healing and Discovery

In Birding Under the Influence: Cycling Across America in Search of Birds and Recovery, author Dorian Anderson takes readers on a captivating journey of self-discovery and healing. This memoir and social commentary chronicles Anderson's quest to overcome alcohol and drug addiction by immersing himself in the natural world through bird watching while bicycling across the United States.

The book delves into the extremes that Anderson went to in order to conquer his addictions and redirect his addictive Type-A personality into more healthy pursuits. As a neuroscientist, Anderson abandons his high-powered research career after experiencing two years of devastating failure. He embarks on a year-long adventure, known in the birding community as a Big Year, to see as many bird species as possible by bicycling alone across the Lower 48 states.

The idea of a bicycling Big Year was sparked by an eight-mile bike trip to Nantucket, Massachusetts, where Anderson saw two Northern Lapwings. Despite his lack of experience with long-distance cycling, the idea persisted and took root in his imagination.

From the moment Anderson leaves Boston on January 1st, 2014, his physical journey is fraught with dangers. He braves cycling through snowstorms during a polar vortex in Massachusetts, narrowly avoids accidents on the Cross Bronx Expressway in New York City, and battles extreme winds that threaten to blow him off the road. He also encounters hostile motorists, aggressive dogs, and endures numerous flat tires and biking mishaps as he traverses the northeast, Florida, the Texas desert, the Rocky Mountains, and southern California. Along the way, Anderson is captivated by the diverse and breathtaking beauty of the American landscape, from the Florida Everglades to the Redwood forests of Oregon.

The act of long-distance cycling serves as a meditative practice, giving Anderson ample time to reflect on his life choices and contemplate his future. Throughout the book, he shares short vignettes that provide insights into his academic achievements, scientific research, and his battles with alcohol and drug addiction, which began in high school. As he pushes his physical and psychological limits, Anderson envisions a new and radically different future for himself—one free from the grip of addiction.

By documenting his daily adventures on a blog, Anderson attracts the attention of a unique community of birders across the country. Many of them offer him meals, a place to stay, and warm showers, providing both hospitality and an opportunity to delve into regional American subcultures.

Over the course of 12 months, Anderson bicycles 17,830 miles through 28 states, walks at least 493 miles (though he suspects it may have been three times greater), and even kayaks eight miles in pursuit of both common and rare bird species. Along his journey, he raises nearly $50,000 for bird habitat conservation and achieves a level of physical fitness he had never before experienced, with a resting heart rate below 40 beats per minute.

In total, Anderson spots 618 bird species. As his Big Year draws to a close on Thanksgiving Day, he makes an extraordinary discovery—a female/juvenile red-legged honeycreeper that had never before been reported in the United States. This remarkable find sparks excitement among local birders, who abandon their Thanksgiving feasts to witness this beautiful vagrant rarity at Estero Llaño Grande State Park.

While the book is generally well-written, it could benefit from closer editing to tighten the prose and create smoother transitions between the adventure and self-reflection. However, Anderson's raw and honest approach to confronting his personal demons amidst the wonder of his birding adventure is both commendable and captivating.

One aspect that could have enhanced the book is the inclusion of maps detailing Anderson's journey. This would have provided readers with a clearer understanding of his adventure and made it easier to follow along. Additionally, a state-by-state breakdown of his experiences would have been a valuable addition.

Birding Under the Influence is an uplifting and hopeful memoir that offers a unique perspective on healing and self-discovery. Anderson's journey serves as a reminder of the transformative power of nature and the importance of pursuing one's passions. This book is a must-read for bird enthusiasts, nature lovers, and anyone seeking inspiration to overcome personal challenges and embark on their own journey of healing and self-discovery.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff194d2ccb9152d392146c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=812,456,x0,y57,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 12:17:44,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/krisholt/2024/03/24/nyt-connections-hints-and-answers-for-monday-march-25/,"NYT ‘Connections’ Hints And Answers For Monday, March 25","Welcome to today's game of Connections! Are you ready to test your skills and find the links between words? Let's get started!

In Connections, you'll be presented with a grid of 16 words. Your task is to arrange them into four groups of four by identifying the connections between them. The groups could be related to horror movie franchises, types of verbs, or even rappers.

Remember, there's only one solution for each puzzle, so be careful with words that could fit into multiple categories. Feel free to shuffle the words to help you spot the connections.

The groups are color coded, with yellow being the easiest, blue and green falling in the middle, and purple being the most challenging. The purple group often involves wordplay, so keep that in mind.

To submit your answer, select four words that you believe go together and press Submit. But be cautious, as a wrong guess will cost you a life. If you're close to getting a group right, you might receive a message indicating that you're only one word away, but it's up to you to figure out which word to swap.

Remember, if you make four mistakes, it's game over. Let's make sure that doesn't happen! I'll provide some hints to help you out, and if you're really struggling, the answers will be available too.

Now, let's take a look at today's 16 words:

- PACE
- CLIPPER
- MOVE
- MEDICINE
- FASTER
- PROMPTER
- ROCKET
- SPEED
- GO
- SPUR
- COMMUTE
- HURRY
- RATE
- VISION
- CLIP
- PACER

Here are the hints for today's groups:

Yellow group — something's swiftness
Green group — speed up!
Blue group — NBA team player
Purple group — linked by a term meaning ""over a long distance""

Now, it's time to reveal the Connections groups. But before we do, make sure you're ready for spoilers!

Today's groups are:

Yellow group — how fast something is going
Green group — ""step on it!""
Blue group — NBA team player
Purple group — tele____

And now, for the moment you've been waiting for, the Connections answers:

Yellow group — how fast something is going (CLIP, PACE, RATE, SPEED)
Green group — ""step on it!"" (FASTER, GO, HURRY, MOVE)
Blue group — NBA team player (CLIPPER, PACER, ROCKET, SPUR)
Purple group — tele____ (COMMUTE, MEDICINE, PROMPTER, VISION)

Unfortunately, there's no perfect game today, but my overall streak is up to five games in a row.

I immediately recognized the blue group, even though I suspected it might be a red herring. The green and yellow groups were interesting, almost like noun and verb versions of the same concept.

I initially included COMMUTE in the wrong group with the greens instead of FASTER, but after correcting that, I successfully identified the connection in the purples for a victory.

That's all for today's Connections clues and answers. If you need hints or the solution for Tuesday's game, be sure to check my blog.

Before I go, here's a quick life tip: make it a point to dine at the best restaurant in your area at least once. Save up if you have to, because trust me, it'll be worth it. While takeout is nice as a treat, there's something truly special about experiencing the best dining nearby. It's likely to be a memorable experience that goes beyond the ordinary.

Good luck with today's game, and I'll see you soon with more Connections challenges!",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/64dbcee7d64da3663d88000e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 17:30:02,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/24/when-to-see-a-great-un-american-eclipse---from-iceland-to-australia/,When To See A ‘Great Un-American Eclipse’ - From Spain To Australia,"On Monday, April 8, North America will witness a total solar eclipse, marking a significant moment for celestial events on Earth. While approximately 12 million Americans experienced totality on August 21, 2017, another 31 million people will have the opportunity to do so on April 8, 2024.

After 2045, the next total solar eclipse on U.S. soil won't occur until 2033 in Alaska. Following that, it will be in 2044 in Montana and the Dakotas before a coast-to-coast spectacle in 2045. However, if you're willing to travel long distances, you don't have to wait that long to witness this extraordinary phenomenon.

During a total solar eclipse, only a small portion of the Earth's surface is engulfed in the moon's shadow. It is within this path that you can experience totality, characterized by sudden darkness during the day, a rapid drop in temperature, an eerie light, unusual animal behavior, and the opportunity to observe the sun's corona.

To witness this unique experience, you need to be in the right place at the right time, which often means traveling to various locations worldwide. Here are some upcoming total solar eclipses and their recommended destinations:

1. Greenland, Iceland, and Northern Spain Eclipse: August 12, 2026
This eclipse will provide a two-minute totality, making Iceland an ideal location to observe it. The western tip of the Snæfellsnes Peninsula and Reykjavik, the capital city, offer excellent vantage points. Northern Spain is also a popular option, but be aware that the eclipse will occur close to sunset, resulting in a low position in the sky.

2. North African Eclipse: August 2, 2027
This eclipse will offer an impressive totality lasting more than six minutes, making it the longest of the century. The path of totality will cross southern Spain and much of North Africa, but Luxor in Egypt, known for the Valley of the Kings and Karnak, will be the prime location. Visitors can enjoy a staggering six minutes and 20 seconds of totality there.

3. Australia and New Zealand Eclipse: July 22, 2028
Sydney Harbour in Australia will be an excellent spot to witness this eclipse, with a totality duration of three minutes and 44 seconds. However, if you prefer a guaranteed clear sky, consider exploring the Australian Outback. Queenstown in New Zealand will also experience totality close to sunset.

4. Southern Africa and South Australia Eclipse: November 25, 2030
Southern Africa presents a fantastic opportunity to witness a two-minute totality before embarking on a game drive in Namibia and Botswana. South Australia will experience the eclipse approximately an hour before sunset. Which continent would you prefer to visit?

5. Pacific Ocean Eclipse: November 14, 2031
To witness this hybrid solar eclipse, embark on a long and solitary cruise from Hawaii. The spectacle will transition from a ""ring fire"" annular solar eclipse to a total solar eclipse southeast of Hawaii before returning to the ""ring fire"" stage.

6. Alaska and Siberia Eclipse: March 30, 2033
Alaska will offer a two-minute totality for this eclipse, providing an opportunity to witness the mesmerizing Northern Lights. While clear skies for the Great Bering Strait eclipse are uncertain, it's worth exploring remote Alaskan towns such as Barrow/Utqiagvik, Prudhoe Bay/Sagavanirktok, and Kotzebue. If the weather cooperates, the northern lights might make a captivating appearance during totality.

7. Central Africa and Asia Eclipse: March 20, 2034
This eclipse, occurring on the equinox, will provide four minutes and nine seconds of totality in Central Africa and South Asia. Southeastern Egypt is an excellent location to witness this long eclipse, and eclipse enthusiasts will gather there in great numbers. Another option is the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Persopolis in Iran. The path of totality will traverse Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, Sudan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Nepal.

8. China, North Korea, and Japan Eclipse: September 2, 2035
For this eclipse in East Asia, Beijing in China or Tokyo in Japan will be the top choices. Just north of Beijing and Pyongyang in North Korea, you can experience almost two minutes of totality. However, if you travel just north of Tokyo, you can extend your viewing time by an additional 30 seconds.

9. Australia and New Zealand Eclipse: July 13, 2037
During this mid-winter eclipse, various locations in Australia, such as Geraldton, Uluru (Ayers Rock), Byron Bay, the Gold Coast, and the remote Lord Howe Island, will be shrouded in the moon's shadow for up to three minutes and 58 seconds. The North Island of New Zealand, including the Ngauruhoe volcano in Tongariro National Park (known as Mount Doom in The Lord of the Rings films) and coastal Napier in Hawke's Bay, will also offer a glimpse of totality.

10. Australia and New Zealand Eclipse: December 26, 2038
If you still have air miles from previous eclipse events, this mid-summer eclipse will predominantly occur over the remote Australian Outback. However, the path of totality will pass just north of both Australia and New Zealand, offering a unique viewing experience.

These upcoming total solar eclipses provide incredible opportunities for eclipse chasers and enthusiasts to witness awe-inspiring natural phenomena. Plan your travels accordingly, and get ready to experience the enchantment of totality.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6596ce996dfc8e3f5f161c42/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 13:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
