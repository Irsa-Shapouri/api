The pharma industry is livelier than ever, with the weight loss drug market sparking an intense race between pharmaceutical giants and up-and-coming challengers. The profound success of drugs such as Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound has triggered industry-wide interest. Now all eyes are on who will stake a claim within this promising commercial landscape, currently dominated by Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk.

Rising contenders, Zealand Pharma from Denmark and German player Boehringer Ingelheim, work in collaboration to create survodutide, an injectable medicine which operates similarly to Wegovy and Zepbound by mimicking the GLP-1 gut hormone. Initial trials proved promising for this drug, not only as a weight loss aid but also as a treatment for fatty liver disease.

San Diego-based Viking Therapeutics has also emerged as a competitor with VK2735, an experimental drug that surpassed Novo and Lilly solutions in mid-stage trials. As we approach the end of March, we await early data on an oral version of this product. Meanwhile, Terns Pharmaceuticals is investigating an oral weight loss medication that targets the GLP-1 hormone and looks forward to results from an initial trial in late 2024.

Structure Therapeutics, a San Francisco startup, is developing another oral GLP-1 drug set to undergo a mid-stage trial this year. Though investors found the initial mid-stage data lackluster, with a late-stage trial planned for 2026, hopes remain high. 

Pfizer, an industry titan, has paused work on two weight loss pills following adverse side effects. However, they maintain an optimistic stance concerning their foray into this sector. Amgen, too, is delving into this market with MariTide, a less frequent monthly injection that may also prevent recurrence of weight gain, an issue with current treatments.

Amidst these bustling rivals, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk plan to fortify their leading positions within the weight loss drug market. They are developing new-generation medications and refining existing ones. Novo is pioneering an oral form of semaglutide designed for daily treatment and exploring compound drugs that can regulate appetite, like CagriSema and amycretin.

The journey from the lab to pharmacy shelves is a prolonged one. It typically takes 10-20 years to authenticate new drugs through all three clinical trial phases, with many not making it through. Promising preliminary results are not surely indicative of successful late-stage trials.

As demand for weight loss medication grows, supply shortages are becoming increasingly evident. Despite considerable investments, manufacturing capacity continues to lag for giants like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. They confess their struggles with meeting demand.

While lower-tier companies concentrate on nurturing and testing new drugs, large pharmaceutical companies often acquire these promising prospects. Roche and AstraZeneca's recent acquisitions offer a glimpse into this practice. Altimmune is also considering partnerships or deals with industry behemoths to facilitate the development of their late-stage drugs.

According to analysts, this competitive market could be worth an astonishing $100 billion by 2030. With over 50 weight loss drugs in different developmental stages from around 40 companies, the potential possibilities are both exciting and lucrative.

For now, Lilly and Novo are anticipated to maintain their market dominance. Their magnitude shields them by facilitating consolidatory deals with care providers, pharmacies, and insurers. They also lead research into obesity-related issues like cardiovascular and kidney diseases, which could reinforce their selling points and promote buy-in from governments, insurers, and patients.

Just as the dawn begins most brightly in the east, so do Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk lead the day in the race towards effective weight loss solutions. However, the day is long, and many competitors are beginning to rise.

Unveiling the Privacy Pitfalls of Generative AI: A Call for Custom Solutions

In the race to harness the transformative power of generative artificial intelligence (AI), businesses must tread carefully to avoid the lurking privacy risks. While AI holds immense promise, it also poses significant challenges for organizations handling sensitive data.

The Privacy Minefield

Generative AI's ability to create diverse content, from text to images, comes with inherent privacy concerns. Using generic AI platforms with proprietary data can lead to accidental disclosures and data breaches. Sensitive training data has been known to fall into the wrong hands, eroding privacy and undermining competitive advantages.

Furthermore, copyright issues loom large. AI relies on vast datasets for learning, often including copyrighted materials. This raises questions about the authenticity and ownership of AI-generated outputs, creating a legal quagmire for businesses.

The OpenAI Paradigm: A Lesson in Uncertainty

The evolution of OpenAI, once a nonprofit and now a capped-profit entity, highlights the fluidity of the AI industry. This shift underscores the potential for AI companies to alter their business models and data management practices.

For businesses relying on third-party AI solutions, OpenAI's transformation serves as a cautionary tale. Data privacy and ownership could be subject to change, emphasizing the need for caution and maintaining control over data.

Custom AI Solutions: A Path to Privacy and Control

In light of these privacy risks, custom AI solutions emerge as a compelling alternative. Developing in-house AI systems grants businesses complete ownership and control over their data, reducing the likelihood of breaches. These bespoke models, shielded from external vendors' policies, minimize the risk of mishandling sensitive information.

Custom AI solutions are tailored to specific business requirements, ensuring alignment with unique goals and challenges. This approach not only enhances data security but also provides a strategic advantage over competitors relying on generic AI offerings. While custom AI development requires a higher upfront investment, the long-term benefits of data protection, operational efficiency, and intellectual property safeguards justify the expense.

Exploring Secure AI Deployment Alternatives

Beyond custom solutions, businesses can explore alternative options for secure AI deployment. Amazon Bedrock, for instance, allows for the creation and deployment of machine learning models within a protected AWS environment. This enables customization and innovation without compromising data privacy.

Other self-hosting options include private clouds and on-premises servers, providing a high degree of control and isolation from external threats. Kubernetes, an open-source platform, enhances the manageability and efficiency of deploying AI solutions at scale.

Cloud service providers like Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud offer specialized tools and services for building private AI environments. These platforms provide robust security features, extensive computational resources, and flexible management options, empowering businesses to maintain control over their AI applications and data.

Securing the Future of AI Innovation

The transformative potential of AI is undeniable, but so too are the privacy risks it poses. By embracing custom, secure AI deployment models, businesses can navigate these challenges and harness the power of AI with confidence.

The imperative for businesses to prioritize data management and security has never been more critical. Custom AI solutions are not just a strategic advantage but a fundamental necessity for safeguarding the future of business innovation in the age of artificial intelligence.

Unlocking the Power of Usage-Based Pricing: Introducing OpenMeter

In the realm of enterprise software, usage-based pricing is taking center stage. This innovative model allows customers to pay only for the services they consume, offering greater flexibility and cost optimization. However, tracking and managing usage can be a daunting task, especially for companies offering usage-based products.

Enter OpenMeter, a cutting-edge solution that simplifies the complexities of usage-based billing. Co-founded by Peter Marton, a former Stripe engineer, OpenMeter empowers businesses to seamlessly monitor and manage usage data, ensuring accurate billing and cost control.

The Challenge of Usage-Based Pricing

Usage-based pricing presents a unique set of challenges for billing and finance teams. Companies often struggle to determine the appropriate charges for their customers based on usage data. This can lead to billing errors, customer dissatisfaction, and lost revenue.

OpenMeter addresses this challenge by providing a real-time infrastructure that integrates usage data with billing and revenue dashboards. This allows companies to track usage in real-time, set usage limits, and enforce rate limits to prevent overspending.

OpenMeter: A Comprehensive Solution

OpenMeter is built on Apache Kafka, a powerful open-source platform for handling real-time data. It processes ""usage events"" across a company's tech stack and converts them into human-readable consumption metrics. These metrics are then funneled to billing and finance dashboards, as well as customer relationship management databases for product and revenue teams to analyze.

OpenMeter's capabilities extend beyond usage tracking. It can also enforce usage and rate limits, ensuring that customers stay within their allocated usage thresholds. Additionally, it supports usage-based and hybrid pricing models, providing companies with greater flexibility in billing their customers.

OpenMeter's Competitive Edge

OpenMeter stands out in the metering landscape due to its open-source nature. Its software is freely available for use, with paid options for enterprises that prefer managed plans. This open-source approach makes OpenMeter accessible to a wider range of businesses, including startups and small businesses.

Marton emphasizes that OpenMeter is also more cost-effective than its competitors. While exact pricing is still being finalized, he assures that OpenMeter offers a competitive advantage in terms of affordability.

Lowering the Payout Threshold

TikTok is also making it easier for creators to start earning rewards. Previously, an effect needed to be used in a whopping 200,000 videos within 90 days to qualify. Now, the threshold has been lowered to just 100,000 videos. This means more creators can get their hands on some extra cash for their hard work.

New Payout Model

TikTok is also tweaking the payout model to make it fairer and more rewarding. From now on, only effects used in public videos will be eligible for rewards. While this may lead to fewer qualified videos, TikTok is compensating creators by switching to a revenue per mile (RPM) model. This means creators will earn rewards based on the total number of qualified videos that use their effect within the first 90 days.

Success Stories

Since the program's inception, some creators have already hit the maximum payouts of $14,000 per effect and $50,000 per month. This shows that the program is not just a token gesture but a real opportunity for creators to make a decent income from their AR creations.

Conclusion

TikTok's Effect Creator Rewards program is a game-changer for AR creators. With its expansion to more regions, lowered payout threshold, and updated payout model, it's now easier than ever for creators to showcase their talents and earn rewards for their creativity. So, if you've got a knack for AR effects, it's time to jump on the TikTok bandwagon and start reaping the rewards!
