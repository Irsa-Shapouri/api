https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-vulnerability-virtual-reality.html,Vulnerability in virtual reality systems identified,"Virtual reality (VR) systems have opened up a whole new world of possibilities for users, allowing them to immerse themselves in virtual environments and interact with a wide range of experiences. However, a team of computer scientists at the University of Chicago has recently uncovered a potential vulnerability in VR systems that could have serious implications for users' privacy and security.

The team has published a paper on the arXiv preprint server, in which they describe the concept of an ""inception layer"" that could be inserted between a user's VR Home Screen and their VR User/Server. This layer, they explain, would create a simulated VR app that appears to be running directly from the VR home screen, when in fact it is controlled by an attacker.

The idea behind this inception layer is to trick users into behaving in ways that could reveal sensitive information to the hackers. For example, the hackers could record a passcode entered into a virtual ATM or intercept and alter information related to financial transactions. They could even manipulate the VR world by adding imagery of friends or family members, using this ruse to gain trust or access to personal secrets.

To test the feasibility of this concept, the researchers enlisted the help of 28 volunteers who played a game using a demonstration VR headset. They then downloaded an app onto the devices, simulating a hacking scenario. Interestingly, only 10 of the volunteers noticed a slight flickering during the download and activation process, and just one of them questioned whether something nefarious was happening.

The research team promptly notified Meta, the maker of the Meta Quest VR system used in the experiment, of their findings. Meta responded by expressing their intention to investigate the potential vulnerability and address it if necessary. The researchers also emphasize that similar vulnerabilities are likely to exist in other VR systems and apps that aim to insert themselves between users and their VR devices.

This discovery raises important concerns about the security of VR systems and the potential for malicious actors to exploit them for their own gain. As VR becomes more prevalent and integrated into our daily lives, it is crucial that developers and manufacturers prioritize user security and take proactive measures to identify and address vulnerabilities.

In conclusion, while virtual reality offers incredible opportunities for immersive experiences, it is essential to remain vigilant and aware of the potential risks. As technology continues to advance, it is our collective responsibility to ensure that users can enjoy the benefits of VR without compromising their privacy and security.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/vulnerability-in-virtu.jpg,2024-03-25 10:20:02,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-co8322-sustainable-fuel.html,Research lights up process for turning CO₂ into sustainable fuel,"Researchers from the University of Nottingham, University of Birmingham, University of Queensland, and University of Ulm have made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of green fuels. They have successfully converted carbon dioxide (CO2) into methanol by using single atoms of copper deposited on a light-activated material. This achievement has significant implications for the development of new and sustainable fuels.

The researchers designed a material consisting of copper anchored on nanocrystalline carbon nitride. The copper atoms are embedded within the nanocrystalline structure, allowing electrons to move from carbon nitride to CO2. This electron transfer is a crucial step in the production of methanol from CO2 under the influence of solar irradiation. The study detailing this breakthrough has been published in the Sustainable Energy & Fuels journal.

Photocatalysis is the process of using light to excite electrons in a semiconductor material, enabling them to react with CO2 and water to form various useful products, including methanol. However, this process has faced challenges related to efficiency and selectivity. The researchers aimed to address these issues by developing a material that maximizes the efficiency of electron transfer and charge separation.

CO2 is a major contributor to global warming, and finding ways to convert it into useful products is crucial. Traditional methods of CO2 conversion rely on hydrogen sourced from fossil fuels, making them unsustainable. The researchers' approach takes advantage of solar energy and abundant water through photo- and electrocatalysis.

Dr. Madasamy Thangamuthu, a research fellow at the University of Nottingham, explained the importance of choosing the right photocatalyst for the process. In their study, they focused on controlling the material at the nanoscale and developed a new form of carbon nitride with crystalline nanoscale domains. This allowed for efficient interaction with light and effective charge separation.

To enhance the functional properties of the carbon nitride material, the researchers heated it to the required degree of crystallinity. They then deposited atomic copper using magnetron sputtering, which facilitated intimate contact between the semiconductor and metal atoms. Surprisingly, even without copper, the new form of carbon nitride was 44 times more active than traditional carbon nitride. However, the addition of just 1 mg of copper per 1 g of carbon nitride quadrupled the efficiency and changed the selectivity from methane to methanol.

Professor Andrei Khlobystov emphasized the significance of sustainable catalyst materials in carbon dioxide valorization. The new catalyst consists of carbon, nitrogen, and copper, all of which are abundant elements on Earth. This new invention represents a major step forward in understanding photocatalytic materials for CO2 conversion and opens up possibilities for developing highly selective and tunable catalysts at the nanoscale.

In conclusion, the researchers' discovery of converting CO2 into methanol using single atoms of copper on a light-activated material holds immense promise for the development of green fuels. Their approach addresses the challenges of efficiency and selectivity in the photocatalysis process. By utilizing sustainable catalyst materials and taking advantage of solar energy and water, this breakthrough brings us closer to achieving a net-zero carbon future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/research-lights-up-pro.jpg,2024-03-25 20:10:01,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/large-language-models-can-help-home-robots-recover-from-errors-without-human-help/,Large language models can help home robots recover from errors without human help,"Home robots have struggled to gain widespread success due to various factors such as pricing, practicality, form factor, and mapping. Even when these issues are addressed, there is still the challenge of handling inevitable mistakes. This problem is not only faced by consumers but also on an industrial level. However, a recent study from MIT demonstrates how large language models (LLMs) can be utilized to address this issue in the robotics space.

The study, set to be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), aims to introduce ""common sense"" into the process of correcting mistakes. It is observed that robots are excellent mimics, but unless they are programmed to adapt to unexpected situations, they struggle to handle them without starting the task from the beginning.

Traditionally, when a robot encounters issues, it exhausts its pre-programmed options before requiring human intervention. This is particularly challenging in unstructured environments like homes, where any changes to the surroundings can hinder a robot's ability to function properly. Imitation learning, which involves learning to perform a task through observation, is popular in the field of home robotics. However, it often fails to account for the countless small variations in the environment that can disrupt regular operation, leading to the need for the robot to start from scratch.

The new research aims to address this challenge by breaking demonstrations into smaller subsets instead of treating them as a continuous action. This is where LLMs come into play, eliminating the need for manual labeling and assignment of subactions by the programmer. LLMs have the capability to provide instructions for each step of a task in natural language. The researchers wanted to connect the continuous demonstration performed by a human with the steps in physical space so that the robot would automatically know its stage in the task and be able to replan and recover on its own.

The study features a demonstration where a robot is trained to scoop marbles and pour them into an empty bowl. While this task may be simple for humans, robots perceive it as a combination of various small tasks. The LLMs are able to list and label these subtasks. During the demonstrations, the researchers purposely sabotaged the activity by bumping the robot off course and knocking marbles out of its spoon. The system responded by self-correcting the small tasks instead of starting from scratch.

According to grad student Tsun-Hsuan Wang, ""With our method, when the robot is making mistakes, we don't need to ask humans to program or give extra demonstrations of how to recover from failures."" This approach eliminates the need for constant human intervention and enables the robot to adapt and recover from mistakes independently.

In conclusion, the use of LLMs in home robotics can greatly improve the ability of robots to handle mistakes and adapt to unforeseen circumstances. By breaking demonstrations into smaller subsets and utilizing natural language instructions, robots can self-correct and recover from errors without the need for constant human intervention. This research paves the way for more efficient and autonomous home robots that can successfully navigate and operate in unstructured environments.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/CommonSense-01-press_0.jpg?w=900,2024-03-25 20:01:06,Innovation,Innovation

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-household-robots-common.html,Engineering household robots to have a little common sense,"Robots are becoming increasingly proficient in carrying out complex household tasks through imitation learning. However, without the ability to adjust to unexpected disruptions, robots often struggle to handle situations that deviate from their trained path. To address this issue, engineers at MIT have developed a method that combines robot motion data with the ""common sense knowledge"" of large language models (LLMs) to give robots a sense of adaptability.

Traditionally, engineers would guide robots through a series of motions, such as scooping marbles from one bowl and pouring them into another. These motions would be imitated by the robot, but any errors made during the process would accumulate and potentially derail the task. The new approach proposed by the MIT researchers allows robots to self-correct execution errors and improve overall task success.

The researchers demonstrate their method using the example of scooping marbles. Instead of treating the entire task as a single trajectory, they break it down into subtasks or trajectories. For instance, before scooping, the robot needs to reach into the bowl, and after scooping, it needs to move to the empty bowl. By identifying and addressing errors within these subtasks, the robot can continue the task without starting from scratch.

To automate the process of identifying subtasks and their corresponding actions, the researchers leverage large language models (LLMs). These models process vast amounts of text data, allowing them to generate logical lists of subtasks based on their understanding of language. For example, if asked to list the actions involved in scooping marbles, an LLM might produce verbs like ""reach,"" ""scoop,"" ""transport,"" and ""pour."" By connecting the output of the LLM to a robot's physical state, the researchers enable the robot to know its progress in a task and make adjustments accordingly.

The team developed an algorithm that maps the natural language labels generated by the LLM to the robot's physical coordinates or an image of its state. This process, known as ""grounding,"" allows the robot to understand its position in the task and replan if necessary.

By combining robot motion data with the knowledge stored in LLMs, the MIT researchers have created a method that enhances a robot's ability to adapt to disruptions and improve task success. This approach eliminates the need for engineers to explicitly program fixes for every possible failure, making it more efficient and less time-consuming.

The researchers will present their findings at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024) in May. With further development and refinement, this method has the potential to advance the capabilities of household robots and make them more adept at handling a wide range of tasks.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/engineering-household.jpg,2024-03-25 09:48:20,Innovation,Innovation

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-strategy-suppress-strain-propagation-ultrahigh.html,A strategy to suppress strain propagation in ultrahigh-Ni cathodes during fast charging,"To meet the demands of the electronics industry and the increasing popularity of electric vehicles, researchers are striving to develop advanced battery technologies. Nickel-rich layered oxides have shown promise as cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LiBs). These cathodes offer several advantages, such as increased battery capacity, improved rate capabilities, and reduced fabrication costs. However, there are also limitations to these cathodes, including capacity degradation and structural instability during fast-charging and long-term cycling.

To address these challenges, a group of researchers from Argonne National Laboratory and other institutes worldwide have introduced a new strategy to enhance the structural stability and reliability of ultrahigh-Ni cathodes. Their findings, published in Nature Energy, outline the use of epitaxial entropy-assisted oxide coating to suppress strain propagation, a process that typically leads to structural deterioration during battery fast-charging and prolonged cycling.

The researchers designed a specialized oxide coating that aligns with the structure of Ni-rich cathodes. This coating not only strengthens the surface of the cathode materials but also enhances ionic conductivity, enabling faster charging of batteries. The coating is based on Wadsley-Roth crystallographic shear phases, compounds that have been found to improve electrode performance in LiBs. These compounds adhere well to Ni-rich cathodes, enhancing their structural stability during prolonged operation and fast-charging.

The team conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of their coating strategy. They coated Ni-rich layered cathodes and tested their performance over time and under different conditions. The results were highly promising, as the coating significantly reduced damage to the cathodes, even during fast-charging and after multiple operation cycles.

The researchers believe that their epitaxial entropy-assisted coating strategy opens up new opportunities for the design and development of high-energy and high-power LiBs, and beyond. By addressing the challenges associated with nickel-rich cathodes, this strategy could contribute to the advancement and widespread adoption of battery technologies in various applications.

In conclusion, the use of epitaxial entropy-assisted oxide coating shows great potential in enhancing the structural stability and reliability of ultrahigh-Ni cathodes. This strategy offers a promising solution to the challenges faced by nickel-rich cathodes in LiBs, such as capacity degradation and structural instability. By aligning the oxide coating with the cathode structure, researchers have achieved improved performance and reduced damage during fast-charging and prolonged cycling. These findings pave the way for the development of high-energy and high-power LiBs, supporting the growing demand for advanced battery technologies in the electronics industry and electric vehicles sector.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/a-strategy-to-suppress.jpg,2024-03-25 09:40:01,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/maju-kuruvilla-is-out-as-ceo-of-one-click-checkout-company-bolt/,Maju Kuruvilla is out as CEO of one-click checkout company Bolt,"Bolt, the one-click checkout company, has undergone a leadership change with the departure of CEO Maju Kuruvilla. Justin Grooms, Bolt's global head of sales, has taken over as interim CEO, as stated on his LinkedIn profile. While Kuruvilla has not provided much information about the change, he confirmed it on LinkedIn and X, simply stating, ""One-Click Checkedout from @bolt! Onwards"" with a rocket emoji. Arjun Sethi, co-founder of venture firm Tribe Capital, commented on Kuruvilla's post, expressing his admiration for the executive.

According to The Information, the Bolt board voted to remove Kuruvilla over the weekend. In January 2022, Kuruvilla, a former Amazon executive, assumed the CEO position after founder Ryan Breslow stepped down. Grooms, on the other hand, has been with Bolt for five years and has held executive roles at companies such as Ultraleap, Datron World Communications, and Qualcomm, as stated on his LinkedIn profile. Bolt has described Kuruvilla's departure as ""amicable"" but has not provided further details.

Bolt has had its fair share of controversy in the past. Breslow, the company's founder, started the company after dropping out of Stanford and was known for his outspoken rants. In an interview with TechCrunch, Breslow mentioned that Bolt had signed significant deals in the second half of 2021, surpassing any previous deals in the company's history. However, the company faced challenges, including a federal probe into whether it violated securities laws during a fundraising round in 2021. Bolt was seeking a $355 million Series E round that valued the company at $11 billion and had raised approximately $1 billion in total venture-backed funding.

Bolt also experienced multiple rounds of layoffs, with at least 185 employees, or one-third of its workforce, let go in May 2022. Further layoffs occurred in early 2023 and December 2023, affecting 29% of the staff. In October, Kuruvilla stated that the SEC was no longer investigating Bolt and that the company was working towards profitability. Bolt also announced partnerships with retailers, including Saks OFF 5TH, Shinola, Filson, Lafayette 148, and Toys ""R"" Us, with plans to improve merchandise returns and provide personalized experiences.

More recently, Bolt signed an exclusive deal with Checkout.com, becoming their ""exclusive one-click checkout provider,"" while Checkout.com became Bolt's preferred payment partner. These developments indicate Bolt's efforts to expand its reach and strengthen its position in the fintech industry.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/profluent-spurred-by-salesforce-research-and-backed-by-jeff-dean-uses-ai-to-discover-medicines/,"Profluent, spurred by Salesforce research and backed by Jeff Dean, uses AI to discover medicines","Last year, Salesforce, known for its cloud sales support software and Slack, led a project called ProGen. This initiative aimed to utilize generative AI to design proteins. The researchers behind ProGen claimed that if successfully brought to market, it could revolutionize medical treatments and make them more cost-effective. The project resulted in research published in the journal Nature Biotech, which demonstrated the AI's ability to create 3D structures of artificial proteins. However, beyond the publication, ProGen did not gain much traction commercially.

Recently, one of the ProGen researchers, Ali Madani, launched a company called Profluent. Madani's vision for Profluent is to take protein-generating technology out of the lab and into the hands of pharmaceutical companies. In an interview with TechCrunch, Madani described Profluent's mission as ""reversing the drug development paradigm."" The company aims to start with patient and therapeutic needs and work backward to create customized treatments.

Madani discovered the parallel between natural language (like English) and the ""language"" of proteins while working at Salesforce's research division. Proteins, which are chains of bonded-together amino acids used by the body for various purposes, can be treated like words in a paragraph. By feeding protein data into a generative AI model, it is possible to predict entirely new proteins with unique functions.

With Profluent, Madani and co-founder Alexander Meeske, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Washington, want to apply this concept to gene editing. Many genetic diseases cannot be cured by proteins or enzymes taken directly from nature. Additionally, existing gene editing systems have functional tradeoffs that limit their effectiveness. Profluent aims to optimize multiple attributes simultaneously to create custom-designed gene editors that are a perfect fit for each patient.

The idea of using generative AI to predict proteins is not new. Nvidia released a generative AI model called MegaMolBART, trained on a dataset of millions of molecules, to search for potential drug targets and forecast chemical reactions. Meta developed a model called ESM-2, trained on protein sequences, which allowed them to predict sequences for over 600 million proteins in just two weeks. DeepMind, Google's AI research lab, created AlphaFold, a system that accurately predicts complete protein structures.

Profluent is training AI models on massive datasets containing over 40 billion protein sequences. Their goal is to create and fine-tune gene editing and protein-producing systems. Instead of developing treatments themselves, Profluent plans to collaborate with external partners to create ""genetic medicines"" with the most promising paths to approval. Madani believes this approach could significantly reduce the time and cost typically required to develop a new treatment.

According to industry group PhRMA, it takes an average of 10-15 years to develop a new medicine from initial discovery to regulatory approval. The cost of developing a new drug can range from hundreds of millions to billions of dollars. Profluent's approach aims to move from accidental discoveries to intentional design, offering a chance to address critical biological problems more effectively.

Profluent, based in Berkeley with 20 employees, has secured backing from prominent venture capital firms such as Spark Capital, Insight Partners, Air Street Capital, AIX Ventures, and Convergent Ventures. Google chief scientist Jeff Dean has also contributed, adding further credibility to the platform.

In the coming months, Profluent's focus will be on upgrading its AI models by expanding training datasets. The company also aims to acquire customers and partners. The competition in this field is fierce, with rivals like EvolutionaryScale and Basecamp Research training their own protein-generating models and raising substantial amounts of venture capital.

Madani believes that Profluent has made significant scientific breakthroughs in gene editing and has developed an initial platform. Now, the company aims to scale its operations and work with partners to achieve its ambitions for the future.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1288172035.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-25 22:08:51,Innovation,Innovation

Despite its goal to enhance search results with generative AI, the initial update has led to the discovery of scams and malware within the search results. An SEO consultant found obvious scams, and Bleeping Computer confirmed the presence of scam sites, fake iPhone giveaways, and tech support scams. The danger lies in the fact that these malicious sites are presented in a friendly and conversational tone, making it difficult for users to identify them as threats. Many of these scams target personal information, adware, or unwanted subscriptions. Some even attempt to install browser extensions that hijack searches or engage in other malicious activities. Google has assured users that they are continuously updating their spam-fighting systems to protect against these threats and have already taken action to remove the examples that were shared. However, the expansion of SGE to a wider audience raises concerns about the potential exploitation of this new threat landscape.

Specifically, Alphabet/Google is being scrutinized for its rules on steering in Google Play and its approach to self-preferencing in search results. Apple is under investigation for its rules on steering in the App Store and the design of choice screens for alternatives to its Safari web browser. Lastly, Meta's ""pay or consent"" model will be examined by the Commission.

A total of five investigations were announced, which is quite significant considering the compliance deadline for these companies was just a few weeks ago. The three gatekeepers, designated under the pan-EU market power and contestability regulation, are now facing formal investigations to determine if they are breaching the rulebook. If violations are confirmed, fines of up to 10% of global annual turnover can be imposed, or even 20% for repeat offenses.

The EU has a maximum of 12 months to conclude these investigations, with a preliminary report possible within six months. However, the duration of the probes may vary. It's worth noting that these investigations come in addition to the increasing antitrust scrutiny these companies are facing in their home country, the United States.

Since the companies unveiled their compliance plans, there has been criticism that they do not fully comply with the new EU law. Google has been accused of launching new rich features in search results to unfairly compete with rivals and avoid the regulation's ban on self-preferencing. Apple's use of notifications to warn users about the risks of leaving its ecosystem has been criticized by developers as ""scare screens."" Meta's ""pay or be tracked"" tactic has also faced condemnation from privacy and consumer rights groups.

The Commission has opened proceedings to assess whether Alphabet and Apple's measures in relation to their app stores comply with the DMA. The Commission is concerned that their steering measures and restrictions may not be fully compliant, as they impose various limitations on developers' ability to communicate, promote offers, and conclude contracts freely.

Regarding Google's self-preferencing, the investigation will focus on the impact it has on rival services, particularly Google's vertical search services such as Google Shopping, Google Flights, and Google Hotels. The EU aims to ensure that third-party services featured on Google's search results page are treated fairly and non-discriminatorily compared to Alphabet's own services.

As for Apple, the EU will examine whether it is complying with user choice obligations on iOS. This includes enabling users to easily uninstall apps, change default settings, and select alternative default services such as browsers or search engines on their iPhones. The Commission is concerned that Apple's measures, including the design of the web browser choice screen, may prevent users from truly exercising their choice of services within the Apple ecosystem.

For Meta, the proceedings will investigate whether its ""pay or consent"" model for EU users complies with the DMA. The EU is concerned that this model may not provide a real alternative if users do not consent, thus failing to prevent the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers.

In conclusion, the EU has initiated investigations into major tech companies to determine if they are violating the rules set forth in the Digital Markets Act. Alphabet/Google, Apple, and Meta are facing scrutiny in various areas, such as steering, self-preferencing, and user choice obligations. These investigations will assess compliance and may result in significant fines if violations are confirmed.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1031626648.jpg?resize=1200,799",2024-03-25 12:10:10,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/london-regtech-gss-raises-47m-to-help-banks-screen-for-global-sanctions/,London regtech GSS raises $47M to help banks screen for global sanctions,"Global Screening Services (GSS), a London-based regulatory compliance platform, has recently secured $47 million in funding. The company specializes in assisting financial institutions in meeting their global sanctions requirements. This funding comes at a time when economic sanctions are on the rise, with the United States imposing trade restrictions and asset blocking measures against countries like Russia, China, and Iran.

GSS was initially incubated within consulting firm AlixPartner before becoming an independent entity in 2021. The company's CEO, Tom Scampion, previously served as the head of financial crime for Deloitte's EMEA arm before joining AlixPartner. GSS received a significant amount of funding last year, including support from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), one of the world's largest banks. In this latest funding round, GSS attracted investments from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), Cynosure Group, and AlixPartner.

Banks often face challenges in enforcing sanctions due to their role in overseeing global financial transactions. It can be difficult to determine who is sending money to whom. In recent years, financial institutions have faced substantial fines for failing to have adequate money-laundering controls and for violating sanctions. For example, Standard Chartered was fined $1.1 billion by regulators in 2019 for inadequate controls, including sanctions breaches related to Iran. Similarly, BNP Paribas was fined a staggering $8.9 billion in 2014 for processing transactions involving sanctioned countries.

As a result, investors have shown increasing interest in regulatory compliance businesses. Companies like Droit in New York and SteelEye in London have also secured significant funding to support their efforts in this field.

GSS offers a sanctions-screening platform that helps banks and financial institutions comply with regulations. The platform operates on a cloud-based system, where institutions input transaction data. GSS then cross-references this data against a standardized set of sanctions lists from around the world, alerting institutions if any matches are found. Additionally, GSS enhances these lists with supplementary data, such as dates of birth, International Maritime Organization (IMO) numbers for ships, and information from the financial transfer systems of sanctioned countries like Russia and China.

Furthermore, GSS provides ""enhanced"" lists for screening purposes. These lists include companies that have partial ownership by individuals, companies, or governments subject to sanctions imposed by OFAC, the EU, or the UK.

With the recent injection of $47 million in funding, GSS is transitioning from the development phase to becoming fully operational. The company is preparing to launch its services for its first customers.

In summary, GSS is a regulatory compliance platform based in London that has raised $47 million in funding to assist financial institutions in meeting global sanctions requirements. With its advanced screening platform, GSS aims to help banks and other institutions comply with regulations and avoid penalties. With the support of investors, GSS is now preparing to go live with its services.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1770041999-e1711386339681.jpg?resize=1200,677",2024-03-25 18:36:37,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/charliefink/2024/03/25/sxsw-2024-xr-that-makes-you-go-wow/,"SXSW 2024: XR That Makes You Go ""Wow""","The Golden Key, which recently won the XR Jury Award at SXSW, is truly a remarkable piece of art that leaves you in awe. Originally conceived as a four-walled projection, the immersive experience on three big screens was nothing short of captivating. Powered by the Stable Diffusion text to image generator, the triptych at The Golden Key was a visual feast that brought together themed images based on various fairy tales.

To make this extraordinary display possible, Charlie Fink had to bring in extra power and cooling at great expense. The audience had the opportunity to contribute their own prompts, witnessing their ideas come to life in real-time as the AI-generated stories unfolded before their eyes. Even with just three screens, the immersive nature of The Golden Key was undeniable, leaving one to wonder how incredible the original four-walled concept must be. The lightning-fast version of Stable Diffusion created a magical world inspired by fairy tales, with guests adding their own twists to the evolving narrative.

The experience felt like a glimpse into a new medium that was unfolding right before our eyes. Directed by Marc Da Costa and Matthew Niederhauser, The Golden Key was a revelation, providing an entirely new and unique experience. It's moments like these that keep drawing me back to SXSW year after year.

Da Costa and Niederhauser also presented another impressive piece called Tulpamancer, which had previously been featured at the Venice Film Festival. In this experience, participants interacted with a tulpa, a thought-form or imaginary companion, through a retro computer terminal. They answered a series of questions about their own lives and then entered a virtual world specially designed for them. Guided by their tulpa, participants embarked on a journey through a series of virtual scenes that invoked and questioned their own memories and potential fates.

Among the other notable projects in the XR experience area was Soul Paint, written and directed by Sarah Ticho and Niki Smit and produced by Anna Firbank. This project received a Special XR Jury Award and left a lasting impression. Eliza McKnitt's Astra, set in space like her previous award-winning XR experience Spheres, was another standout. Additionally, Impulse, which focused on sharing the stories of individuals living with ADHD, showcased an impressive use of mixed reality technology.

Reimagined Volume III: Young Thang, produced by a female-led team in partnership with Meta, presented a new kind of storybook experience. This VR animation series delved into lesser-known fables, mythology, and folklore, offering a fresh perspective. Shadowtime, selected for the Venice Film Festival, provided a poetic contemplation of escapism and real-world threats like climate change.

Detachment, a satirical VR experience from Ristband, was also worth an honorable mention. Known for their multidimensional mixed reality concerts, Ristband took viewers on a cinematic journey following a voice-over actor's quest to understand the programming of a script.

At SXSW 2024, Ristband returned for their third year, presenting the SXSW Official Future x Music event. The event featured an ambisonic A/V installation, a mixed reality concert by the band Pivots, and performances from international artists Glasser, Moritz Simon Geist, Minimal Schlager, and Kikuo. Blending game design, cinema, virtual reality, live performance, and generative AI visuals, Ristband showcased the innovative ways artists are leveraging technology to tap into their artistic potential.

Chris Madsen, Senior Sales Engineer for VR Metaverse Engage, described the event as a transformative and immersive journey between the physical and digital realms. Attendees experienced this journey through Pico Neo 4E mixed reality headsets, provided by MACE Virtual Labs. The headsets allowed them to seamlessly transition between physical reality, seen through the passthrough cameras, and fully immersive virtual dreamscapes that transported them to fantastical realms.

Overall, the XR experience at SXSW 2024 was a testament to the power of technology and creativity. These projects pushed boundaries, offering audiences unique and captivating experiences that bridged the gap between reality and imagination. The future of XR is undoubtedly bright, and I can't wait to see what the next year will bring.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660200d15ac92b36fd540aa5/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=937,527,x48,y0,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 18:57:26,Innovation,Innovation
