https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2024/03/25/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-qualcomm-snapdragon-exynos-specs-price-new-galaxy-z-flip/,New Galaxy Z Flip 6 Details Reveal Samsung’s Chip Choice,"The upcoming Galaxy Z Flip 6 is set to offer some interesting features that will benefit both consumers and Samsung. While the choice of RAM and storage options, such as 8 GB or 12 GB of RAM and either 256 GB or 512 GB of storage, may seem familiar among high-end smartphones in 2024, it's the choice of chipset that really stands out. Samsung will be using a combination of Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 and its own Exynos 2400 chipsets.

In the past, every Galaxy Z Flip 5 model came with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset, just like the Galaxy S23 family in 2023. However, with the Galaxy S24 mixing chips from both manufacturers, it was expected that Samsung would take a similar approach for its leading flip phone. This decision is significant because the Snapdragon and Exynos chipsets offer different levels of performance. Generally, the Snapdragon platform is considered to be more powerful compared to Samsung's own Exynos rival. Although the performance gap is small, it is noticeable in head-to-head comparisons on the Galaxy S24 handsets. However, the Exynos family is known for being more power efficient and providing better battery life.

Unfortunately, consumers will not have the option to choose between the two chipsets. Each sales region will receive either Exynos or Snapdragon, but not both. Despite this limitation, the Exynos 2400 chipset has an advantage for Samsung. As it is their own chip, using the Exynos chipset will reduce the overall cost of the Galaxy Z Flip 6. This is especially important in a market where foldable phones are becoming increasingly competitive, and consumers often compare prices with similar designs from other brands like Oppo.

While some consumers may prefer larger candy bar-styled phones for maximum power, Samsung hopes that they will also consider the Galaxy S24 Ultra. However, for those who value a balance between functionality and design, foldable phones are the modern choice. At this point, any slight performance loss due to the Exynos chipset will be outweighed by the more competitive price of the Galaxy Z Flip 6.

In conclusion, the upcoming Galaxy Z Flip 6 is set to offer a combination of high-end specifications and a more affordable price, thanks to the use of Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 and Samsung's own Exynos 2400 chipsets. While consumers will not have the option to choose between the two, the performance difference between the chipsets is minimal, and the Exynos chipset provides better power efficiency. This decision allows Samsung to reduce the overall cost of the device, making it more competitive in the growing market for foldable phones. So, if you're in the market for a stylish and functional smartphone, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is definitely worth considering.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6601751f179c2562261fe620/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 09:00:16,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericsiegel/2024/03/25/ai-success-depends-on-how-you-choose-this-one-number/,AI Success Depends On How You Choose This One Number,"AI: Choosing the Right Threshold for Operational Decisions

Artificial intelligence (AI) has the power to revolutionize operational decision-making, but it needs your guidance. With the potential to impact millions of decisions, such as who to contact, approve, investigate, or medicate, AI plays a crucial role. However, one important step often gets overlooked: selecting the decision threshold. This single number distinguishes between 'yes' and 'no' outcomes. For instance, market only to customers with a likelihood of buying above 30%, or approve credit applicants with a likelihood of repayment above 95%.

Choosing the decision threshold is not just a technical challenge but a strategic business choice. It's the part that directs the rocket, rather than the rocket science itself. When making this decision, every predictive AI project has to consider practical trade-offs between competing objectives. Let's delve into this further.

The Essence of AI: A 'Likelihood Calculator'

While AI can have different meanings, when it comes to improving large-scale operations, the applicable technology is machine learning (ML). ML, a central component of AI, learns from data to predict outcomes. It powers various operational decisions, such as predicting clicks, purchases, lies, or even mortality.

The ML use cases we focus on here are predictive AI or predictive analytics, rather than generative AI that has dominated headlines recently. Predictive AI has the potential to bring about significant improvements in enterprise efficiencies, surpassing generative AI in many cases.

While perfect predictions are impossible, ML offers the next best thing: likelihoods. Each predictive model generated by ML acts as a ""likelihood calculator."" It assigns a likelihood score to each individual case, indicating the chances of the predicted outcome.

To translate these likelihood scores into action, many projects only require selecting a single decision threshold or confidence threshold. For example, a marketing project might set the threshold at 30%: if a customer has a likelihood of buying above 30%, they receive a marketing brochure. This one choice empowers the computer to make millions of decisions.

The Decision Threshold: Drawing the Line

The decision threshold is where everything changes. It determines how a predictive model drives decisions and significantly influences the bottom-line improvements it can make. In fact, the choice of threshold often has a more substantial impact on project value than changes to the model development process itself.

Take payment card fraud detection as an example. A predictive model determines whether to authorize or hold each transaction. Naturally, the transactions predicted to be most likely fraudulent should be held. But where do you draw the line?

A medium-sized bank might choose a threshold that blocks the top 3% of risky transactions, successfully preventing 220,000 cases of fraud per month. However, this might inconvenience customers by erroneously blocking legitimate transactions 77,000 times. On the other hand, if the bank opts for a more lenient threshold and only blocks the top 2%, there would be fewer inconveniences (around 17,600) but also less fraud prevention (around 180,000 cases) (based on approximate results from using XGBoost, a popular ML solution, on a public dataset of credit card transactions scaled to 10 million transactions per month; for a more detailed breakdown of fraud detection's value, refer to this link).

Each predictive AI project presents a range of trade-offs and options. By setting the decision threshold, you choose the trade-off that aligns with your objectives. However, this decision requires strategic thinking. Regardless of how well data scientists develop a predictive model or how efficient the ML software is, business leaders must weigh in on setting the decision threshold before operationalizing predictions and capturing value.

One Model, Infinite Possibilities

By adjusting the decision threshold, a business can utilize each predictive model developed by its data scientists in various ways. Setting the threshold determines how a company prioritizes its actions. How many transactions are worth investigating for fraud? How many customers justify marketing expenditures, considering that a lower threshold means more prospects but also expenses on less likely buyers? How many credit applications should a bank approve, given the trade-off between accepting more applicants and the risk of repayment?

The decision threshold allows businesses to strike the right balance and make informed choices. It enables them to harness the power of predictive AI to optimize their operations and achieve their goals.

Conclusion

AI has the potential to transform operational decision-making, but it relies on your guidance. Selecting the decision threshold is a critical step that should not be overlooked. By choosing the right threshold, businesses can unlock the full potential of predictive AI and make accurate, impactful decisions. Remember, it's not just a technical choice; it's a strategic one that shapes the direction of your AI initiatives. So, take the time to consider the trade-offs and find the threshold that aligns with your objectives. With the right decision threshold, AI can be a game-changer for your organization.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600f86863ceebda28e9989e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 09:40:04,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.zdnet.com/article/saving-hours-of-work-with-ai-how-chatgpt-became-my-virtual-assistant-for-a-data-project/,Saving hours of work with AI: How ChatGPT became my virtual assistant for a data project,"Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been the subject of much hype and excitement lately. As someone who has written about it extensively, I must admit my contribution to the excitement. However, it is important to remember that tools like ChatGPT are just that - tools. They can be used to assist with projects, similar to other productivity software.

Today, I want to share a project where ChatGPT saved me several hours of tedious work. While you may not have the same project, I hope my thought process for using ChatGPT as a workhorse tool will inspire you to find innovative ways to utilize it in your own projects.

Let's dive into the details of the project. In about a month, I will be publishing what I like to call a ""stunt article"". These articles are fun projects that I come up with, which I know readers will find interesting. The article I'm currently working on is a breakdown of how much computer gear I can purchase from Temu for under $100. Spoiler alert: I managed to stay within budget, spending a total of $99.77. Stay tuned for the article, as it promises to be an enjoyable read.

Putting this article together required spending time on the Temu website, exploring various products, and selecting the ones to highlight. For instance, I stumbled upon an iPad keyboard and mouse combo priced at just six dollars!

To ensure I stayed within my $100 budget, I wanted to compile all the Temu links into a spreadsheet, note the price of each item, and rearrange them until I hit my desired total budget. However, the challenge lay in converting the Temu links into something manageable. And that's where ChatGPT came to the rescue.

Phase 1: Gathering the links
I began by collecting all the links. For each product, I copied the link from Temu and pasted it into a Notion page. Notion provides the option to create bookmark blocks when pasting URLs, which not only contain the links but also crucially include the product names. Here's a snapshot of the page:

[Insert snapshot of the Notion page]

As you can see, I've started selecting the blocks. Once all the blocks are selected, I copied them and pasted the entire set into a text editor, which I had set to dark mode. The pasted blocks may not look visually appealing, but they serve their purpose.

Phase 2: Identifying the data
Let's take a closer look at one of the data blocks. I've switched my editor out of dark mode to make it easier for you to see the data elements within the block:

[Insert snapshot of the data block]

Within each block, there are three key elements. The gold text represents the product name, enclosed within braces. The green text corresponds to the base URL of the product, enclosed within parentheses. There's also a question mark that separates the main page URL from the additional tracking data passed to the Temu page. For the purpose of this project, we only need the main URL. The purple sections highlight the delimiters, which we will feed into ChatGPT.

Phase 3: Teaching ChatGPT to recognize the data
First, I provided ChatGPT with this prompt:

""Accept the following data and await further instructions.""

Then, I copied all the information from the text editor and pasted it into ChatGPT. At this point, ChatGPT knew to wait for additional details.

The next step was crucial to the success of the project. I wanted ChatGPT to extract the titles and links while disregarding the rest. Here's the prompt I used for this purpose:

""The data above consists of a series of data blocks. Each block begins with a section enclosed within [] brackets, representing the title. Following the [] brackets is an open parenthesis (preceding the web URL). Our goal is to extract the URL from each block, excluding everything after the question mark, as well as the question mark itself. Most URLs will end in .html. We will refer to this as the URL. For each block, display the TITLE, followed by a carriage return, followed by the URL, and conclude with two newlines.""

This process served two purposes. Firstly, it allowed me to name the data, making it easier to refer to later. Secondly, it tested ChatGPT's understanding of the task at hand.

ChatGPT successfully completed the assignment, albeit stopping about two-thirds of the way due to buffer limitations. I instructed the bot to continue, and it provided the remaining data.

Doing this process manually would have been tedious, involving numerous cut-and-paste actions. However, ChatGPT accomplished the task within moments.

Phase 4: Cleaning up Temu's complex titles
For my project, Temu's product titles were too lengthy and complex. Instead of something like:

""10 Inch LCD Writing Tablet, Electronis Memo With Leather Protective Case, Electronic Drawing Board For Digital Handwriting Pad Doodle Board, Gifts For""

I preferred a simpler format:

""LCD writing tablet with case""

I conveyed this preference to ChatGPT, and it generated a cleaner version of the titles.

In conclusion, ChatGPT proved to be an invaluable tool for this project, saving me hours of manual work. Its ability to understand instructions and extract the necessary data allowed for a smooth and efficient process. While it may not be suitable for every project, it is certainly worth exploring the potential of AI tools like ChatGPT to streamline your work and boost productivity.

Stay tuned for my upcoming article on the computer gear I purchased from Temu within my $100 budget. It promises to be a fun read for tech enthusiasts and bargain hunters alike.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/70d8814af33b190ff84b8faa5f9bafe13d3586e2/2024/03/25/7d1cb1ff-3bb7-4972-a6cd-33d04da76bc1/cover.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/techcrunch-mobility-the-wheels-are-starting-to-come-off-the-fisker-ev-bus/,TechCrunch Mobility: The wheels are starting to come off the Fisker EV bus,"TechCrunch Mobility is a weekly newsletter that covers news and insights on the future of transportation. In this edition, we discuss the latest developments in the automotive industry, including new regulations proposed by the Biden Administration. We also highlight some exciting startups and investments in the mobility space. Let's dive in!

The Biden Administration has recently proposed two new standards that will impact U.S. automakers and consumers. The Department of Energy (DOE) has introduced a ""petroleum equivalency factor"" that gives electric vehicles (EVs) a score under the government's corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. This move aims to make it easier for automakers to meet the CAFE standards and avoid hefty fines. Additionally, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has released tailpipe standards for 2027 to 2032 model year cars and trucks, which impose stricter requirements on automakers. However, the proposed rules allow for flexibility in meeting the standards through various powertrain options. These regulations have significant implications for the automotive industry and the future of transportation.

While these new standards may not have a direct impact on EV startups like Rivian, Tesla, and Lucid, they do affect legacy automakers that are investing in EV development while still profiting from internal combustion engine vehicles. Plug-in hybrids may emerge as winners in this scenario. Despite the challenges, the EV market continues to grow, with startups and established players alike pushing the boundaries of electric mobility.

In other news, Moove, an African mobility fintech startup, recently raised $100 million in a Series B funding round led by Uber. Moove offers vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers and aligns with Uber's goal of achieving a fully zero-emission fleet by 2040. This investment marks Uber's first in an Africa-founded startup and highlights the company's commitment to expanding its presence globally.

Another notable development is the partnership between Rivian and Tesla. While details are scarce, this collaboration could have significant implications for the EV industry. Rivian, known for its electric trucks and SUVs, has gained attention and investment from major players, including Amazon and Ford. Tesla, on the other hand, has revolutionized the EV market and continues to innovate with its electric vehicles and energy products. The partnership between these two companies could lead to exciting advancements in electric mobility.

Additionally, Candela, an electric boat startup, raised $25 million in a funding round led by Groupe Beneteau. This investment highlights the growing interest in electric transportation beyond cars and trucks. As the world focuses on reducing emissions and transitioning to sustainable energy sources, electric boats could play a significant role in the future of transportation.

On the startup front, Clevon, a company specializing in autonomous delivery technology, is facing some challenges but has secured funding for a merger with an American electric vehicle company. While details are limited, this merger could help Clevon continue its mission of revolutionizing autonomous delivery.

Lastly, Amber, a startup that offers aftermarket Tesla extended warranties, raised $3.18 million in a seed funding round. This investment reflects the demand for innovative solutions in the EV market, including services that cater to Tesla owners.

Overall, the future of transportation is evolving rapidly, driven by technological advancements, regulatory changes, and the growing demand for sustainable mobility solutions. Startups and established companies alike are pushing boundaries and shaping the industry's landscape. Stay tuned for more exciting developments in the world of mobility!

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-large-language-simple-mechanism-knowledge.html,Large language models use a surprisingly simple mechanism to retrieve some stored knowledge,"Large language models, such as those that power popular artificial intelligence chatbots like ChatGPT, are incredibly complex and widely used in various areas. However, scientists are still trying to fully understand how these models work. To shed light on their inner mechanisms, researchers from MIT and other institutions conducted a study to examine how these models retrieve and decode stored knowledge.

Surprisingly, the researchers discovered that large language models often employ a simple linear function to recover and decode stored facts. These linear functions, which involve only two variables and no exponents, capture the straightforward relationship between variables. What's more, the model tends to use the same decoding function for similar types of facts.

By identifying these linear functions for different facts, the researchers were able to probe the model and determine its knowledge about new subjects and where that knowledge is stored within the model. Even when the model provides incorrect answers, it often retains the correct information. This finding suggests that the approach used in this study could be used in the future to identify and correct falsehoods within the model, reducing its tendency to produce incorrect or nonsensical responses.

Evan Hernandez, an electrical engineering and computer science graduate student at MIT and co-lead author of the study, explains that although these models are highly complex and trained on vast amounts of data, there are sometimes simple mechanisms at work inside them. This study uncovers one such mechanism.

The paper detailing these findings was written by Hernandez and co-lead author Arnab Sharma, a computer science graduate student at Northeastern University, along with their colleagues from MIT, Harvard University, and the Israeli Institute of Technology. The research will be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024) in Vienna.

Large language models, also known as transformer models, are neural networks that consist of interconnected nodes or neurons organized into layers. These models encode and process data, storing knowledge as relations that connect subjects and objects. For example, the relation ""Miles Davis plays the trumpet"" connects the subject (Miles Davis) to the object (trumpet).

As a transformer model accumulates knowledge, it stores additional facts about a particular subject across multiple layers. When a user asks a question related to that subject, the model must decode the most relevant fact to provide an accurate response.

To understand how this decoding process works, the researchers conducted a series of experiments on large language models. Despite their complexity, these models were found to decode relational information using simple linear functions. Each decoding function is specific to the type of fact being retrieved. For instance, the model uses one decoding function to output the instrument a person plays and a different function to output the state where a person was born.

To estimate these linear functions, the researchers developed a method and calculated functions for 47 different relations, such as ""capital city of a country"" and ""lead singer of a band."" Although there are countless possible relations, the researchers focused on this subset because they represent the types of facts that can be expressed in this manner.

To test the functions, the researchers changed the subject and observed if the model could recover the correct object information. Their findings suggest that large language models rely on these linear functions to retrieve and decode stored facts.

This study offers valuable insights into the inner workings of large language models and provides a method for analyzing and understanding the knowledge they contain. By identifying the simple mechanisms at play, researchers can potentially improve the accuracy and reliability of these models in the future.

Understanding how large language models retrieve and process information is crucial for harnessing their full potential in various applications, such as customer support, code generation, and language translation. With further research, scientists can continue to unlock the mysteries of these complex models and refine their capabilities.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/large-language-models-2.jpg,2024-03-25 09:34:06,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/03/25/adopting-ai-legislation-and-best-practices/,Adopting AI Legislation And Best Practices,"The rapid growth and adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) have raised important questions about the role it should play and the need for legislation to govern its use. Despite the global AI market reaching $196 billion in 2023 and projected to grow to $1.81 trillion by 2030, legislation has not kept pace with these developments, leading to controversy and uncertainty.

The need for legislation becomes evident when we consider recent incidents, such as the Taylor Swift deepfake case. As AI technology advances, it becomes easier to create fake photos, videos, and even phone calls, often with disastrous consequences. Such incidents highlight the urgent need for regulations to address the misuse of AI.

Another area of concern is copyright issues related to AI. AI requires a massive amount of data for training purposes, which raises questions about fair use and compensation for original authors. Should AI companies be allowed to consume and learn from copyrighted material without compensation? Where should the line be drawn between fair use and copyright infringement? These complex issues require legislative intervention to provide clarity and establish guidelines for AI companies.

While some of these issues are being addressed through court cases, legislation is ultimately necessary to provide a clear path for the development and responsible use of AI. In the meantime, companies should take proactive steps to establish best practices for AI use.

One crucial step is to upskill employees. As with any new technology, employees need to be trained and educated about AI's capabilities, limitations, and associated risks. This is particularly important when it comes to handling internal company data. The incident involving Samsung banning the use of ChatGPT after a leak of sensitive code underscores the importance of educating employees on the proper use of AI and data protection.

Using internal AI models instead of widely available options is another way to protect data and ensure its segregation. By internalizing the architecture, companies can customize the model to their specific needs and maintain greater control over their data.

Addressing bias is a critical aspect of responsible AI use. AI has the potential to perpetuate racial and gender biases if the training data is not diverse. Companies must ensure that their training data includes diverse perspectives to prevent biases from creeping into their models. Regular tests should be conducted to identify and address any biases that may arise.

Furthermore, the evaluation of AI usage should be an ongoing process. As technology and legislation evolve, organizations need to continually assess and adjust their AI practices. This includes making changes to training data, access policies, and regulatory compliance to ensure alignment with the evolving landscape.

While AI legislation is being considered in various jurisdictions, the current state of the field can be likened to the Wild West. Until regulations catch up with reality, companies must take it upon themselves to self-regulate and adhere to best practices in their use of AI. This not only benefits the companies themselves but also their customers and stakeholders.

In conclusion, the growth of AI has outpaced legislation, creating a need for clear regulations governing its use. Incidents like the Taylor Swift deepfake case highlight the potential risks associated with AI misuse. Companies should take steps to upskill employees, use internal AI models, address bias, and continually evaluate their AI practices. While legislation is being developed, self-regulation and adherence to best practices are essential for responsible AI use.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fde85c0195d22e6b3dd766/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 09:30:00,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/apple-sued-microsofts-ai-ambitions-and-nvidia-surprises/,"Apple sued, Microsoft's AI ambitions and Nvidia's surprises","Welcome to this edition of Week in Review, where we bring you the latest updates on the Apple antitrust lawsuit and Microsoft's AI ambitions. Let's dive right in!

The U.S. has joined international regulators in accusing Apple of using monopolistic tactics to lock in iPhone users. In response, Apple claims that the Department of Justice's (DOJ) actions could ruin exactly what its users enjoy about its phones and ecosystem.

The lawsuit filed by the DOJ draws a connection between Apple and Microsoft in the 1990s era, highlighting some key differences between the two companies and their efforts to retain customers. However, experts predict that we shouldn't expect much to come out of the lawsuit in the short-term. It could take three to five years to reach a resolution.

Now, let's move on to other news.

Microsoft made headlines this week by acquiring Inflection AI's co-founders. Mustafa Suleyman will lead the consumer-facing unit Microsoft AI, while Karén Simonyan takes on the role of EVP and CEO of the same group. Inflection AI had raised $1.3 billion, with Microsoft being the biggest investor.

Nvidia's GTC event also grabbed attention. CEO Jensen Huang surprised attendees with a prediction that artificial general intelligence is only five years away. Additionally, Nvidia announced a new AI platform called GR00T, designed for humanoid robots.

In a surprising development, Google is reportedly in talks with Apple to deploy Google's AI model on upcoming iOS updates. This raises questions about whether this will be a temporary measure until Apple's own AI efforts catch up or a long-term partnership between the two tech giants.

Moving on to hacking and privacy news, the Biden administration is gathering an international coalition to fight against commercial spyware. Interestingly, some investors joining the coalition were previously involved in the same business they are now fighting against.

In the gaming world, a hack disrupted a $5 million Apex Legends tournament. The hackers claimed they did it for fun and to expose the exploit used to halt the tournament.

Glassdoor users have reported that their real names are being added to their profiles without consent. The only solution provided to them is to delete their accounts entirely. It's a reminder to double-check the anonymity of any profiles used to share negative experiences about employers.

In funding and IPO news, Reddit's IPO had a strong start, with the stock jumping 48% on its first day of trading. Astera Labs, a company that specializes in connectivity hardware for cloud computing data centers, also had a successful IPO, with its stock closing at $62.03 on day one.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/gostudent-tutoring-profitability/,"GoStudent, the online learning platform, says it's now profitable","GoStudent, the online tutoring marketplace based in Vienna, Austria, has established itself as a leading startup, valued at $3.2 billion. With 11 million families and 23,000 tutors on its platform, GoStudent has now achieved profitability. CEO Felix Ohswald stated that the company is not only EBITDA profitable but also has positive operating cash flow. GoStudent is one of the few Austrian startups that has gained recognition in the international tech scene, alongside Bitpanda and Runtastic.

However, GoStudent faced challenges on its path to profitability. The online learning market experienced a crash, leading to a decline in customer demand and significant cash burn. In 2021, the company lost €89 million, which increased to €220 million in 2022. This resulted in layoffs and cost cuts.

GoStudent experienced rapid growth from 2019 to 2022, scaling its core business model to over €100 million in revenue. Nevertheless, the company burned through €150 million in cash in 2022 alone. As the market shifted, GoStudent realized it needed to change its approach. It reduced its burn rate by 70% in 2023, but further adjustments were necessary. The company underwent multiple rounds of layoffs and made strategic decisions to cut expenses, such as eliminating lavish parties, pausing acquisitions, and refraining from expanding into new markets.

The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on education and the growing popularity of edtech benefited GoStudent. The company transitioned from having to convince parents about the benefits of online tutoring to becoming a trusted solution for students in need of educational support. Despite this success, GoStudent still needed to address its cash burn issue.

To address this, GoStudent decided to focus on Europe and adopt a more organic growth strategy outside of German-speaking countries. It exited the U.S. market and shifted its focus to bottom-line growth rather than top-line growth. The company aims to build the number one global school and unlock the potential of every student through personalized tutoring. While scaling at lower costs may present challenges in maintaining a personalized approach, GoStudent plans to leverage technology to match each student with the right tutor, regardless of location.

GoStudent's acquisition of StudienKreis in 2022 demonstrates its evolving approach. StudienKreis, established in 1974, operates physical learning centers primarily in Germany. GoStudent intends to leverage these centers for hybrid learning, combining in-person and online education. CEO Felix Ohswald believes that the future of education is hybrid and emphasizes the importance of a ""glocal"" approach, where technology enables personalized tutoring regardless of national or regional curricula.

Most of GoStudent's tutors are university students, which facilitates a strong connection with students while providing quality service.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Founders-of-GoStudent-Gregor-Muller-I-Felix-Ohswald-2.jpg?w=1024,2024-03-25 11:00:36,Innovation,Innovation

Imagine being able to hire employees from anywhere around the world with the help of an AI 'agent'. That's exactly what Borderless AI, a new startup that recently secured $27 million in seed funding, aims to do. Unlike traditional AI assistance that aids in tasks like retrieving information, Borderless AI takes it a step further by automating the entire employment process. From completing employment contracts to handling onboarding documents, this innovative AI technology is revolutionizing the way companies hire globally.

In a conversation with Borderless co-founder Willson Cross and other industry experts, we explored the implications of this groundbreaking startup for the field of human resources. With substantial funding from notable investors like Susquehanna and Aglaé Ventures, as well as a partnership with the language model Cohere, Borderless AI is poised to make significant strides in the HR space. It's no wonder that the industry is buzzing with anticipation, wondering if Borderless can achieve the same level of success that Harvey, a legal AI startup, has accomplished.

Undoubtedly, AI is reshaping the work of human resources, delivering on its promise to eliminate mundane tasks and streamline operations. However, the question remains: will AI free up HR professionals to focus on more strategic and creative aspects of their roles, or will it ultimately replace more jobs in the field? In his new book, Wharton professor Ethan Mollick shares his insights on the transformative power of AI in the workplace. He emphasizes the importance of learning and development as a means to adapt to the changing landscape, stating, ""Your employees are your R&D lab right now."" Mollick's perspective highlights the growing significance of HR in the future of work.

In other news, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) chief, Michael Whitaker, has criticized Boeing's safety culture, accusing the company of prioritizing production over safety. Whitaker cited a culture survey of Boeing and the FAA's audit into the company to support his claims. The ongoing safety and quality issues have put Boeing under regulatory scrutiny since the incident involving a Boeing 737 Max 9 door plug blowing out during an Alaska Airlines flight. In response to these challenges, Boeing CEO David Calhoun announced that he will step down at the end of 2024, along with several other executives.

Additionally, Mustafa Suleyman, the co-founder of Inflection AI, has made a significant move by leaving the company to join Microsoft. This departure marks a major shakeup in one of Silicon Valley's most valuable AI startups. Suleyman will be instrumental in forming Microsoft AI, a new group within the company. Meanwhile, Inflection AI will shift its focus to providing an application programming interface (API) to other businesses, pivoting away from its chatbot, Pi.

Amidst these industry developments, Unilever has announced plans to cut thousands of jobs worldwide and spin off its ice cream business, which includes iconic brands such as Ben & Jerry's and Magnum. This strategic move is part of Unilever's broader restructuring plan aimed at saving $868 million over the next three years. CEO Hein Schumacher intends to drive growth and increase efficiency within the company.

In the realm of education, President Joe Biden has made a significant announcement regarding student debt relief. His administration has canceled $6 billion in student debt for 78,000 public service workers, including teachers, nurses, and firefighters. This action is part of the administration's ongoing efforts to alleviate the burden of student loans, providing incremental relief after the Supreme Court's ruling against broad debt forgiveness.

Looking ahead, we have the privilege of hearing from author Ethan Mollick, a renowned professor at Wharton. His book, ""Co-Intelligence: Living and Working with AI,"" has gained significant popularity. Mollick's insights shed light on the potential of AI to transform our lives and work. Stay tuned for our exclusive interview with him in the upcoming newsletter.

As we navigate the ever-evolving landscape of work and technology, it is crucial to stay informed and adapt to the changes. Borderless AI and other groundbreaking initiatives are paving the way for a future where global hiring becomes seamless and efficient. With AI as our ally, we can unlock new possibilities and empower HR professionals to focus on the essence of their roles: nurturing talent and driving innovation.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660171a27597fcfde20fad48/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 09:18:10,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/spotify-courses-learning/,Spotify tests video courses to teach everything from music production to Excel,"Spotify, known for its music streaming, podcast entertainment, and audiobooks, is now venturing into the world of e-learning. The company is testing the waters in the U.K. by offering freemium video courses in partnership with third-party providers such as the BBC and Skillshare. While at least two lessons will be free, the complete courses will range in price from £20 to £80 on average. For now, the prices will be the same for both basic and premium users.

Mohit Jitani, the London-based product director for Spotify's education business, explained that the pricing choices are part of the testing phase to gauge demand. The aim is to make the courses more compelling and exciting based on user feedback. The courses will be accessible on Spotify's web and mobile platforms, and they will be featured in the home and browse tabs under the ""Courses"" section.

These courses fall somewhere between YouTube, Master Class, and LinkedIn Learning. They cover a wide range of subjects, including music production, Excel tutorials, and lessons on creating online learning content. While other online learning platforms offer interactive content and various media formats, Spotify's focus is on one-directional, on-demand video.

Some courses may include extra documents as supplementary material, but there are currently no tests or interactive elements. Jitani did not comment on whether Spotify plans to introduce interaction or gamification features in the future. The initial partners for the courses include Skillshare for creatives, PLAYvirtuoso for the music industry, BBC Maestro for Master Class-style courses, and Thinkific for individuals interested in building their own online learning classes.

Spotify intends to curate the courses it offers based on users' listening and search preferences. While there is no limit to the range of topics, the company will focus on what users are most interested in. Third-party publishers own the videos and license them to Spotify, but the videos will be hosted and purchased directly on Spotify's platform. Revenue from the sales will be shared among the creator, publisher, and Spotify, with content partners responsible for distributing payments to creators.

The decision to enter the education market in the U.K. aligns with Spotify's strategy to diversify its business while seeking consistent profitability and stronger margins. The U.K. was chosen due to its significant market size and high user engagement. Financially, Spotify has faced ups and downs, experiencing layoffs and posting net losses in recent years. However, the company sees potential in the correlation between popular podcasts and education content on its platform. Around half of Spotify Premium subscribers have listened to education or self-help podcasts, suggesting a potential cross-promotion opportunity.

Overall, Spotify's foray into e-learning leverages its existing podcasting business, data on user behavior, and tools for creators. By offering educational content, Spotify aims to increase user engagement and generate additional revenue. While the success of this venture remains to be seen, it showcases Spotify's ambition to evolve beyond music streaming and become a multifaceted platform for entertainment, information, and learning.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Courses-on-Spotify-PR-Image-6-2.png?resize=1200,683",2024-03-25 08:59:18,Innovation,Innovation
