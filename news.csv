https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/24/new-whatsapp-warning-iphone-15-pro-max-samsung-s24-ultra-upgrade/,New WhatsApp Warning Suddenly Issued For 2 Billion Users,"As WhatsApp releases its most significant update in years, there is one feature that you should avoid using at all costs. It has the potential to cause dangerous consequences, so be cautious. 

This year, 2024, is expected to bring about the biggest change in the global messaging landscape in a decade. We are witnessing various changes in popular messaging platforms, such as iMessage, WhatsApp, Signal, Google Messages, and Facebook Messenger. These changes often revolve around the misunderstanding of end-to-end encryption, a feature that has been used by iMessage, WhatsApp, and Signal for many years. Recently, Google Messages and Facebook Messenger have also made end-to-end encryption the default setting. 

The importance of end-to-end encryption cannot be overstated. WhatsApp even warns users that third-party chats are not as secure as WhatsApp-to-WhatsApp chats. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has also emphasized the significance of full iMessage security on Android, arguing that Apple makes iPhone users less secure by denying this feature. Despite pressure from governments and security agencies, Facebook Messenger has now adopted end-to-end encryption as the default setting. 

Surprisingly, there have been media reports encouraging users to transfer their chats and chat history from WhatsApp to Telegram. WhatsApp provides an export setting within the chat menu, allowing users to select Telegram as the recipient. In 2021, Telegram announced that users can bring their chat history, including videos and documents, from apps like WhatsApp to Telegram. However, this is an alarming practice. Unlike WhatsApp, Telegram does not provide end-to-end encryption by default. Users need to select the ""secret chat"" option for each individual chat to enable encryption. Kaspersky, a cybersecurity company, warned last year that Telegram is not as secure as it claims to be. Telegram chats do not use end-to-end encryption by default, and users are not informed about the secure chat option. 

Therefore, it is a major security mistake to move chats from WhatsApp, which is end-to-end encrypted by default, to Telegram, which is not. This is especially concerning for group chats that contain sensitive content from multiple users. WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption is seamless and requires no user intervention, making it more secure than Telegram. 

I previously warned about the dangers of migrating WhatsApp chats to Telegram, despite the backlash against WhatsApp when Meta (formerly Facebook) threatened to change user terms and conditions. ESET's Jake Moore advises against pulling content out of end-to-end encrypted messaging platforms, as it removes the protective barriers designed to safeguard messages. While accessibility is important in today's online world, it should not come at the cost of security and privacy. 

Telegram promotes itself as a cross-platform messaging app that is easy to use. However, this ease of use is achieved by tapping into content stored on Telegram's central servers. If Telegram were to implement end-to-end encryption, this approach would not work. Telegram also highlights its cloud storage feature, which reduces smartphone storage usage. However, its architecture prioritizes accessibility and simplicity over full encryption. The security of your data on Telegram is based on policy rather than technology. 

Therefore, I strongly advise against following any advice to switch from WhatsApp to Telegram. It would be a step backward, regardless of the marketing claims. Additionally, there are other issues associated with Telegram that you need to be aware of. 

Telegram plays two distinct roles in the messaging world. On one hand, it positions itself as an easy-to-use alternative to WhatsApp, which is why it offers the option to migrate chats. On the other hand, Telegram has been criticized for lacking content controls, leading to its suspension by Spain's High Court. Furthermore, it has been compared to the dark web, with some referring to it as ""social media for organized criminals."" While Telegram serves various purposes, including activism and campaigning, its rise in popularity has also attracted criminal elements. 

In conclusion, it is essential to prioritize your privacy and security when choosing a messaging app. While Telegram may offer certain features and convenience, its lack of default end-to-end encryption puts your sensitive information at risk. Stick with WhatsApp, which ensures that your messages are protected from outsiders right from the start.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65b41420a2b346798e66d370/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2207,1442,x681,y315,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 23:45:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/24/meet-the-apps-that-tell-you-when-to-take-your-eclipse-glasses-off/,Meet The Apps That Tell You When To Take Your Eclipse Glasses Off,"When to remove your solar eclipse glasses can be a source of confusion for many people. Attending a total solar eclipse requires careful planning and preparation. First, you must position yourself within the path of totality, which is only 115 miles wide. Secondly, you need to ensure that the sky is clear at your chosen location. Lastly, you must know the precise moment to remove your eclipse glasses to witness the sun's majestic corona.

While these steps may seem overwhelming, it is essential to understand that removing your eclipse glasses is a straightforward process. You remove them when it gets dark. If you are situated within the path of totality, darkness will descend rapidly as the moon's shadow envelops your surroundings. This moment is impossible to miss. On the other hand, if you are not within the path of totality, there will be no significant change in lighting, and you should continue using your glasses.

However, advancements in technology have introduced smartphone apps that enhance the eclipse-viewing experience. These apps provide an immersive audio guide and advise you on when to remove your solar eclipse glasses as totality begins. Additionally, they offer information about various eclipse phenomena, such as shadow bands, Baily's beads, and the diamond ring effect. Using these apps with earphones allows for a more engaging experience, but it is advisable to opt for over-the-ear models like bone conduction earphones to remain aware of your surroundings.

Here are some notable apps that can enhance your solar eclipse viewing experience:

1. The Eclipse Company (Platforms: iOS and Android)
   - Cost: Pro version available for additional fees (to be confirmed)
   - Features: Real-time weather updates, cloud forecasts for totality, countdown timer with vibration alert for safe removal of solar eclipse glasses, and detailed information about local eclipse events. This app also provides audio instructions for observing eclipse phenomena.

2. Solar Eclipse Timer App (Platforms: iOS and Android)
   - Cost: $1.99 per eclipse
   - Features: This app determines your location, confirms if you are within the path of totality, and guides you through the contact times. It also provides instructions for observing eclipse phenomena. Developed by renowned eclipse chaser and educator Gordon Telepun, this app is particularly useful for photographers, offering a dedicated ""Photographer's Mode"" developed in collaboration with ex-NASA eclipse calculator and photographer Fred Espenak, also known as ""Mr. Eclipse.""

3. One Eclipse (Platform: iOS only)
   - Cost: $1.99
   - Features: Created by non-profit organizations Astronomers Without Borders and Simulation Curriculum, OneEclipse supports a program for recycling eclipse glasses in underserved communities worldwide. Alongside simulating the eclipse from your location or any other place on Earth, the app includes an interactive map with precise eclipse event times and a dynamic Eclipse Countdown clock. It also provides a simple audio timer for each phase of the eclipse.

These apps not only enhance your eclipse-viewing experience but also offer additional features and benefits. Whether you choose to use them or not, it is crucial to plan your eclipse viewing carefully and prioritize your safety.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/24/samsung-s24-ultra-s23-free-update-warning-for-galaxy-android-users/,Samsung Issues Critical Update For Millions Of Galaxy Users,"If you own a Samsung Galaxy device, there is an important update that you need to check and install as soon as it becomes available. Additionally, there is a significant change coming to your device that you don't want to miss out on.

Samsung has been rolling out its March security update, starting with premium devices and now including more budget models. For example, carrier-unlocked S21 FE devices in the US recently received the update. Various versions of the S24s, S23s, and S22s received the update in the preceding two weeks, with older and budget variants following suit. It is crucial to ensure that your device downloads and installs this new software as soon as it becomes available for your network and model.

You can check if your device is eligible for the monthly update by visiting the provided link.

Among the numerous fixes in the Android and Samsung updates, there are a couple of high-risk vulnerabilities that have been patched. These vulnerabilities could potentially allow malware to take control of some or all of your device. Therefore, it is essential to keep your device updated to protect against such threats.

However, the availability of the March update is not the most significant news of the week. Samsung has finally joined Google's seamless update roadshow after years of resistance. Instead of going through the traditional process of downloading, installing, and rebooting for each update, the new system downloads and installs updates in the background to a secondary partition on the device. When the device restarts, it boots from this partition, making it the primary one, while the other partition awaits the next update. This reduces the downtime during which the device cannot be used normally, with most of the process happening in the background.

Google explains that these A/B system updates, also known as seamless updates, ensure that a bootable system remains on the disk during an over-the-air update. This reduces the chance of an inactive device after an update, leading to fewer replacements and repairs at warranty centers.

You will be able to tell if a seamless update is being installed by the two progress bars displayed on the screen—one for the download/installation and the other for verification. Currently, the Galaxy A55 is serving as the guinea pig for Samsung's initial seamless update rollout, but it is expected that this feature will be extended to more devices in the coming months. We eagerly await to see which devices will be next in line.

It's uncertain whether this update approach will be implemented across all Samsung models. Samsung updates have been known for their complexity and the need to consult checklists to understand what, when, and for how long. However, a recent comment from the Android Open Source Project suggests that the legacy alternative to seamless updates will be removed after running parallel to the A/B approach for eight years.

While this new update method may shorten the update process to just a minute or two of reboot time, it doesn't necessarily simplify the Samsung/Android update combination that occurs every month across a range of devices. Nevertheless, it eliminates the need for user action. Since A/B updates happen in the background, they no longer require user initiation. It is recommended to schedule updates when the device is in idle maintenance mode, such as overnight and on Wi-Fi, to avoid disrupting users.

Although Samsung's update process is still far from Apple's seamless experience, it is a step closer to making the update process more user-friendly. As iPhone and Android devices continue to evolve and become more similar, we can hope for further improvements in the future.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65b9d23fb7b46f6467a28780/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2366,1280,x313,y135,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 22:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/25/google-upgrade-samsung-s24-s23-pixel-towards-apple-iphone-15-pro-max/,Google Suddenly Reveals Surprise Android Update That Beats iPhone,"Android and iPhone are constantly competing to offer users the best features and functionality. In a surprising turn of events, Google has unveiled a new update for Android that not only matches an existing iPhone feature but goes even further. This update is a significant step forward for Android and could potentially change the game in terms of user safety and security.

One of the standout features of this update is the inclusion of an emergency satellite service. This feature brings Android up to par with the satellite SOS functionality that Apple has had on its iPhone for a few years. However, Google's offering takes it a step further by incorporating a Garmin rescue service into its plan. This is a major advancement in ensuring the safety and security of Android users.

While Apple's emergency SOS feature is limited to emergencies only, Google's update aims to bridge the gap and provide users with more options. The latest Android 15 developer preview introduces the possibility for users to expand their cellular accounts to include a satellite add-on. This means that core messaging apps can utilize the satellite network, eliminating the issue of cellular black spots and connectivity black holes.

According to Mishaal Rahman, Android 15 DP2 introduces UI elements to ensure a consistent user experience for devices that support satellite connectivity. Additionally, the update expands platform support for satellite connectivity by adding a new API that apps can use to detect when a device is connected to a satellite. Android 15 also allows SMS/MMS/RCS apps to utilize satellite connectivity for sending and receiving messages.

This is where the real news lies. Some networks already have plans to offer LEO satellite connectivity as an account option. Initially, it was believed that Google would introduce a satellite SOS feature for Pixel phones. However, it seems that the update goes beyond that, potentially paving the way for satellite messaging options in partnership with T-Mobile. This opens up exciting possibilities for direct-to-phone satellite connectivity, especially considering Elon Musk's announcement that SpaceX achieved impressive download speeds to an unmodified Galaxy S21 Ultra.

While we wait for these advancements to become more commonplace, the integration of messaging capabilities with satellite connectivity is a great start. Android 15 is expected to include this feature, assuming there are no major changes. This development further highlights the ever-narrowing gap between Android and iPhone, with Google leading the way and Apple likely to follow suit. It's been an interesting week, especially with the news that Gemini might be coming to iPhone and Apple's claims about the DOJ lawsuit essentially turning iPhone into Android.

In an update on March 23rd, it was revealed that Google's plans for satellite messaging coincided with the news that Gemini might be coming to Apple's iPhone. This is significant because it not only brings Android and iPhone closer together but also enhances Google's role within the iPhone ecosystem. This development showcases yet another way in which Android is moving faster than iPhone, as Gemini is already being deployed on Android handsets while Apple users wait for clarity on what to expect with the next OS in the fall.

Overall, the latest update for Android is an exciting development that brings Android users closer to the functionality and features that iPhone users have enjoyed for years. With satellite connectivity becoming more accessible and messaging integration improving, the future of direct-to-phone satellite connectivity looks promising. As the competition between Android and iPhone intensifies, it's clear that Google is leading the charge, with Apple likely to follow suit.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65d79ec3dadcd6b682668331/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 00:06:15,Innovation,Innovation

Welcome back, Wordle enthusiasts! It's the last week of March, and time sure flies when you're playing puzzle games. Despite the odd weather this weekend, with a surprise snowfall, it's time to get back to work and Wordling!

For those seeking hints and clues for today's Wordle, you've come to the right place. Let's dive in!

Hint: Normally we think of this as a proper noun.
Clue: Today's Wordle has a double letter.

And now, for the answer, let's reveal today's phrase...

[Insert Answer Here]

Wordle Analysis

Every day, I eagerly check Wordle Bot to see if I've cracked the code. You can check your own Wordles with Wordle Bot as well. Today's puzzle had me quite confused, to be honest. It started off with a daunting 195 possible solutions, and even after using the clue ""boink,"" I was still left with 40 options.

However, my breakthrough came with the guess ""allay."" It informed me that there was more than one 'L' in the phrase, narrowing down my choices to just one word. I almost went with ""palsy"" before realizing I needed a second 'L.' After some brainstorming, I settled on ""sally,"" which I usually associate with a name but also refers to a battle tactic.

Competitive Wordle Score

Once again, it's a wash for me. No points for guessing in four or tying with the Bot. Just a big, fat zero. But hey, there's always tomorrow!

Today's Wordle Etymology

The word ""sally,"" in a non-proper noun context, primarily means to suddenly rush forth or make a sudden attack from a defensive position. It can also mean to set out on a journey or venture. The etymology of ""sally"" in this context is quite interesting, tracing back through several languages before arriving in English.

The term originates from the Middle French word ""sallie,"" which is the noun form of ""sallir,"" meaning ""to rush out, leap forth."" ""Sallir"" itself comes from the Latin word ""salire,"" meaning ""to leap."" This Latin root has given rise to various related words in English, such as ""salient"" (prominently projecting) and ""assail"" (to attack), reflecting the idea of movement or leaping forth.

Thus, the etymology of ""sally"" reflects the action of moving out or leaping forth, often with a sense of suddenness or unexpectedness. Whether it's in a physical attack from a fortified position or embarking on a new journey or venture, ""sally"" captures the essence of taking action.
