https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2024/03/24/wwdc-2024-date-exactly-when-apple-will-reveal-iphone-mac-and-ipad-software/,"WWDC 2024 Date: Exactly When Apple Will Reveal iPhone, Mac And iPad Software","Apple's annual developers' conference, known as WWDC or DubDub, is a highly anticipated event for tech enthusiasts. This year, despite the challenges posed by Covid-19, Apple is expected to hold the conference in June. However, the exact dates and format are yet to be announced.

In previous years, Apple has typically announced the date of WWDC around this time. However, in 2021 and last year, the announcement was made in late March, while in 2022, it was made in early April. Therefore, it is likely that the dates for WWDC 2024 will be confirmed soon.

Traditionally, WWDC takes place in early June, unless there are exceptional circumstances such as a pandemic. In 2020, due to Covid-19, the dates were pushed to late June. However, in all other years, the conference has been held in the first full week of June, starting on a Monday and running until Friday.

Based on this pattern, it is reasonable to expect that WWDC 2024 will follow the same dates as in 2019, which were Monday, June 3 to Friday, June 7. Alternatively, it could be the week after, from Monday, June 10 to Friday, June 14. Historically, WWDC has finished as late as June 11, so the latter dates are still within the usual timeframe.

In terms of format, WWDC has undergone significant changes since 2020. In that year, the keynote was pre-recorded, and there were no in-person attendees due to the pandemic. This marked a departure from the previous years when thousands of people gathered in a large auditorium to watch the keynote live.

Since then, every keynote has been recorded, but Apple has gradually increased the number of attendees in Cupertino. While the numbers are still a fraction of what they used to be before Covid-19, last year saw a significant increase compared to the previous year.

For this year's WWDC, it is expected that the keynote will be pre-recorded, featuring Tim Cook and Craig Federighi live on stage at Apple Park. There will likely be a limited number of attendees, including VIPs, press, and staff.

Apple has a tradition of timing its keynotes for 10 a.m. local time, specifically Pacific Daylight Time. This ensures that audiences around the world can tune in at a reasonable hour to watch the event.

As soon as Apple officially announces the dates for WWDC 2024, the news will be reported promptly. Stay tuned for updates on this exciting event that brings together developers, tech enthusiasts, and Apple fans from all over the world.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600830c22fb840e0281afe2/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 16:00:15,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) are two companies that have experienced significant growth in recent years. Despite their different core businesses, there are several parallels between the two.

Both companies found success through unexpected opportunities. AWS realized that it could sell its internal services, such as storage and compute, to external customers. Similarly, Nvidia discovered that its GPU, originally designed for gaming, was well-suited for processing AI workloads.

This led to explosive revenue growth for both companies. Nvidia's revenue has grown at triple digits, reaching $22.1 billion in Q4 2024 from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024. However, the majority of this growth came from Nvidia's data center business. AWS, on the other hand, has consistently been a major revenue driver for Amazon, although its growth has slowed down in recent years.

Both companies benefited from being in the right place at the right time. As web apps and mobile technology became more prevalent, the cloud became a valuable resource for enterprises. Similarly, the rise of AI and large language models coincided with the increased use of GPUs for processing these workloads.

While AWS has become a highly profitable business, Nvidia's growth has surpassed it recently. However, as the law of large numbers applies, Nvidia may also face challenges sustaining its growth in the future. The question is whether Nvidia can become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS.

In the short term, Nvidia's financial outlook is positive. The company expects to generate $24 billion in revenue for Q1 FY25, a 234% increase compared to the previous year. However, analysts predict that Nvidia's growth rate will decline as the company's revenue ramps up. Despite this, Nvidia is still expected to continue scaling its revenue past the $100 billion annual run rate mark.

AI appears to be a driving factor behind Nvidia's continued growth. Even as competition from AMD, Intel, and other chipmakers emerges, Nvidia remains in control of the market. However, AMD is gaining traction at the board level, posing a potential challenge to Nvidia's dominance.

Overall, Nvidia's momentum looks promising for the next few years. While competition may increase, Nvidia's strong market position and focus on AI give it an advantage. As long as the company continues to innovate and adapt to changing market dynamics, it has the potential to maintain its growth trajectory.

In conclusion, Nvidia and AWS have experienced remarkable growth in recent years. Despite their different origins, both companies have capitalized on unexpected opportunities and benefited from industry trends. While AWS has become a highly profitable business, Nvidia's growth has surpassed it recently. The challenge for Nvidia is to sustain its growth and become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS. With the continued demand for AI and its strong market position, Nvidia has the potential to achieve this goal.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/techcrunch-mobility-the-wheels-are-starting-to-come-off-the-fisker-ev-bus/,TechCrunch Mobility: The wheels are starting to come off the Fisker EV bus,"Welcome to TechCrunch Mobility, your go-to source for all things transportation. In this edition, we'll be discussing some recent developments in the industry, including the Biden Administration's proposed standards for U.S. automakers, Uber's investment in an Africa-founded startup, and more. So let's dive right in!

First, let's talk about the new regulations proposed by the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These regulations will have a significant impact on U.S. automakers and consumers. While the regulations have been softened to accommodate the automotive industry, car dealers, and unions, they still impose stricter standards than before.

The DOE has introduced a ""petroleum equivalency factor"" that assigns a score to electric vehicles (EVs) under the government's corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. The original proposal would have made it challenging for automakers to meet these standards, resulting in billions of dollars in fines. However, the revised standards provide some relief to automakers.

On the other hand, the EPA has released tailpipe standards for 2027 to 2032 model year vehicles. These standards impose more stringent requirements on automakers but allow them to meet the rules through various powertrain options. The standards are also technology agnostic, meaning automakers can comply without relying solely on battery electric vehicles. This is a departure from the original proposal, which aimed for 67% of U.S. passenger vehicle sales to be electric by 2032.

While these regulations don't have a significant impact on EV startups like Rivian, Tesla, and Lucid, they do affect legacy automakers. These companies are investing billions in EV development while still profiting from internal combustion engine vehicles. It seems that plug-in hybrids may be the winners in this scenario.

Moving on to other news, let's talk about Moove, an African mobility fintech startup that recently raised $100 million in a Series B funding round led by Uber. Moove offers vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers in Africa. Uber's investment in Moove makes sense as the startup is its largest car financing and vehicle supply partner. Furthermore, Moove's focus on electric vehicles aligns with Uber's commitment to a fully zero-emission fleet by 2040.

In other startup news, Clevon, a company that develops autonomous delivery technology, was recently on the verge of shutting down. However, the company has managed to secure funding and is now in talks for a merger with an American electric vehicle company. While details are scarce, the merger is expected to be completed by the first half of June.

Lastly, we'd like to highlight Amber, a Bay Area startup that has launched an aftermarket Tesla extended warranty product. The company raised $3.18 million in a seed round, demonstrating the interest in this niche market. Additionally, Candela, an electric boat maker, secured $25 million in funding led by Groupe Beneteau. These investments reflect the growing demand for innovative solutions in the mobility sector.

That's all for this edition of TechCrunch Mobility. We hope you found these insights valuable. Stay tuned for more updates on the future of transportation!","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1363022906.jpg?resize=1200,730",2024-03-24 19:00:33,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/technology/article/moba-games/,Top Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) Games,"MOBAs, or multiplayer online battle arena games, have become incredibly popular over the past 15 years. What began as a simple modification for a popular strategy game has evolved into a genre of standalone games competing to be the top MOBA in the world. While many challengers have fallen by the wayside, the giants of the genre continue to attract millions of players every month. However, finding the best MOBA for you can still be a challenging task if you don't know where to look.

So, what exactly is a multiplayer online battle arena game? A MOBA is an online game that pits two teams, typically consisting of five players each, against each other in a strategic battle to destroy the opponent's base using unique player-controlled characters. These games are usually played on PC or mobile devices and have gained popularity due to their difficult-to-master gameplay.

The MOBA genre originated as a mod for Warcraft III, a popular strategy game with a thriving modding scene. Defense of the Ancients (DotA) is widely recognized as the first MOBA and, despite being a mod, became a major game in its own right. Some members of the DotA mod team later left to develop their own MOBA, which became League of Legends and achieved instant success. Valve, the developers of the Steam games platform, also entered the MOBA market by acquiring members of the original DotA team to create Dota 2, a direct competitor to League of Legends. This marked the beginning of a period where major publishers attempted to build their own MOBAs, but most failed to gain traction.

Over the years, hundreds of MOBAs have been released across various platforms. Some have become incredibly popular and continue to thrive, while others have been forgotten within months. The top MOBA games today are the ones that have stood the test of time and have amassed large and loyal audiences. These games have either brought something unique to the table or have managed to capture an audience that remains engaged for years. It's worth noting that two of the biggest MOBAs in the world are well over a decade old and continue to innovate in a genre that has seen numerous copycats. These games have received critical acclaim from industry experts and are considered the best of the best.

Dota 2, the direct sequel to the original DotA mod, has been one of the most popular games on Steam for over a decade. It retains the spirit of the original MOBA while making it more accessible to a wider range of players. Although technically released in 2013, Dota 2 was available in beta form in 2011. Developed by Valve with the involvement of Ice Frog, the lead developer of the original DotA mod, Dota 2 has undergone significant changes over the years. Map updates, new playable characters, and continuous balance adjustments have transformed the game, but its core gameplay remains the same. Two teams of five players battle across a three-lane map, aiming to destroy the enemy's Ancient and emerge victorious. Dota 2 is widely regarded as one of the most complex games in the world, offering a multitude of variables and mechanics that can take thousands of hours to master. Even experienced players admit that there are aspects of the game they still don't fully understand. Best of all, Dota 2 is free to play, with optional microtransactions for cosmetic items being the only form of payment.

League of Legends, on the other hand, is the biggest MOBA in the world, boasting over 100 million monthly active players. Its success revolutionized the industry and sparked a frenzy of companies wanting to create their own League of Legends clones. However, it was the original game that endured and stood the test of time. Riot Games, founded by several developers from the original DotA mod, set out to create a standalone game with a different vision. League of Legends aimed to simplify some of the more complex aspects of DotA, making it more accessible to newcomers. The result was a slightly less intricate version of the MOBA format, featuring the classic three-lane map and teams of five battling to destroy each other's base. While some complexity was removed, the core elements of strategic gameplay remained intact. League of Legends continues to thrive, with a dedicated fan base and regular updates from its developers.

In conclusion, MOBAs have become a global gaming phenomenon, with millions of players around the world engaging in strategic battles to prove their skills. The genre's origins as a mod for Warcraft III paved the way for standalone games like Dota 2 and League of Legends, which have become the most successful and enduring MOBAs to date. These games offer unique gameplay experiences, attracting players with their complexity, strategic depth, and dedicated communities. Whether you choose Dota 2 or League of Legends, you're sure to find a challenging and rewarding gaming experience that will keep you entertained for years to come.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fb05c9fa323af23f667c73/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 14:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewwight/2024/03/24/helping-patients-access-sickle-cell-disease-treatments-in-west-africa/,Helping Patients Access Sickle Cell Disease Treatments In West Africa,"A researcher from Cameroon is on a mission to help patients in low-income countries in West Africa afford the medicine they need for sickle cell disease. With over 4 million people worldwide affected by sickle cell disease, 80% of cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa, and 89% of women in central and west Africa lack access to universal medical coverage. Dr. Marthe-Sandrine Eiymo Mwa Mpollo, a scientist and co-founder of NaYa Health, recognized that having a drug for sickle cell disease is not enough if patients cannot afford it.

NaYa Health is a digital patient assistance platform that aims to help underserved patients without insurance have timely access to medication, even when they are short of cash. The platform offers solutions such as community savings, deferred payments, and a portable health-only savings account to manage health risks and protect earnings. In a pilot implementation in Cameroon's capital, NaYa has already made a significant impact by boosting the ability of informal workers to handle unexpected challenges, increasing income for local medical providers, and ensuring guaranteed access to critical services.

NaYa Health's innovative approach caught the attention of MIT Solve, as they were selected in the financial inclusion challenge. Dr. Mpollo is proud to say that NaYa Health is delivering on the promise of research findings by enabling patients with sickle cell disease in Cameroon to access the medicines they need without delay, even when they are short of cash.

Dr. Mpollo's passion for medicine in Cameroon stems from her childhood, where she witnessed the impact of sickle cell disease on families and communities. Inspired by shows like ""doctors without borders,"" she knew from an early age that delivering effective healthcare in limited resource settings was possible. Although her journey led her to life science research in Canada and the US, working on therapies for sickle cell disease, she realized that access to medication is crucial for research to save lives. This realization led her to establish NaYa Health.

Dr. Mpollo believes that scientists from the global South have a unique perspective on healthcare limitations, including affordability, access, and cultural acceptance of research findings. Their lived experiences enable them to tailor their research to better address the needs of their communities. By working with local actors and adapting scientific findings, they can create end-to-end solutions for healthcare issues in the Global South.

In Zambia, another team of entrepreneurs, researchers, and health professionals is using artificial intelligence to improve care for pregnant women. Despite a significant decrease in maternal death rates, Zambian women still face a 1% risk of dying during pregnancy or childbirth. Tafadzwa Kalisto Munzwa, founder and CEO of Dawa Health, has developed the DawaMom project, which utilizes AI tools, last-mile health workers, mobile clinics, and digital platforms to enhance maternal and child health. With over 60 community health workers supporting in-community healthcare and over 800 mothers signed up on the mobile platform, Dawa Health is making a positive impact.

These innovative initiatives are revolutionizing healthcare in Africa, addressing critical issues such as access to medication and maternal health. Through the use of technology, creative solutions, and a deep understanding of local contexts, these entrepreneurs are changing lives and improving healthcare outcomes. As we continue to support and invest in these groundbreaking projects, we can create a healthier future for all.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66009a73668df974c31e0a4f/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=579,579,x127,y431,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 17:54:08,Innovation,Innovation
