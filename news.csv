https://www.reuters.com/technology/nigeria-files-tax-evasion-charges-against-binance-tax-agency-says-2024-03-25/,"Nigeria files tax evasion charges against Binance, tax agency says","Nigeria's revenue service has recently taken legal action against Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, for alleged tax evasion. The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) in Abuja has filed charges against Binance, accusing the platform of four counts of tax evasion. These charges include non-payment of value-added tax (VAT), company income tax, failure to file tax returns, and complicity in aiding customers to evade taxes through its platform. Binance has not yet commented on the tax charges.

In response to the charges, Binance released a statement acknowledging that Nadeem Anjarwalla, Binance's regional manager for Africa, is no longer under Nigerian custody. The company also stated that it is actively collaborating with authorities to resolve the issue. It is important to note that Tigran Gambaryan, Binance's head of financial crime compliance, and Anjarwalla were detained upon arriving in Nigeria after the country's decision to ban several cryptocurrency trading websites.

Nigerian authorities have requested an Abuja court to extend the detention of the two Binance executives involved in the country's cryptocurrency crackdown. Initially, a warrant was used to hold them, but it has since lapsed. Binance has announced that it will cease all transactions and trading in Nigeria's local currency after March 8. This decision comes as a result of the country's crackdown on crypto exchanges, which have been accused by authorities of contributing to a black market for foreign exchange. Any remaining balances in Nigerian naira will be automatically converted into Tether, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar.

This recent development reflects the ongoing challenges faced by cryptocurrency exchanges in various jurisdictions. Governments around the world are grappling with how to regulate and tax this rapidly growing sector. In the case of Nigeria, the government has taken a firm stance on crypto exchanges, leading to legal actions against Binance. It remains to be seen how this situation will unfold and what impact it will have on the cryptocurrency industry in Nigeria.

The rise of cryptocurrencies has sparked a global debate on their legality, taxation, and potential risks. While many countries are embracing cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, others are adopting a more cautious approach. The Nigerian government's crackdown on crypto exchanges is part of a broader effort to regulate the industry and protect consumers. However, critics argue that these measures may stifle innovation and hinder the growth of this promising sector.

As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, it is essential for governments and regulators to find a balanced approach to cryptocurrency regulation. Striking the right balance between protecting consumers and fostering innovation is crucial. It is also important for cryptocurrency exchanges to comply with relevant laws and regulations to maintain transparency and trust with their users. The outcome of the Nigerian government's legal action against Binance will undoubtedly have implications for the wider cryptocurrency industry and set a precedent for future regulatory actions.

In conclusion, Nigeria's revenue service has filed tax evasion charges against Binance, accusing the cryptocurrency exchange of various offenses. Binance is the largest crypto platform globally, and these charges have significant implications for the industry. The Nigerian government's crackdown on crypto exchanges reflects a broader global trend of governments grappling with how to regulate this emerging sector. It remains to be seen how this legal action will unfold and what impact it will have on the cryptocurrency industry in Nigeria and beyond.",https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RT7YEBQ2Y5OTFAPMEIUUQSOKIE.jpg?auth=c8a9eae1f27ef89cfb43c7e01a2f6bb2d18d771a8974652eb667098d38b91869&width=1920&height=1005&smart=true,2024-03-25 09:00:32,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/03/25/how-organizations-can-use-cx-ai-to-connect-with-their-consumers/,How Organizations Can Use CX AI To Connect With Their Consumers,"organizations in industries like cycling, personalization is becoming increasingly important. Consumers are willing to share their information with organizations in exchange for tailored content and experiences. With the advancements in CX AI, organizations can now anticipate consumer needs and deliver personalized interactions at the right time.

One of the key tools at the disposal of organizations is an interaction-centric cloud CX platform powered by CX AI. By having all customer interaction data in one place, organizations can gain a comprehensive view of each individual consumer. This allows them to better understand their customers and tailor interactions based on this knowledge. With this platform, organizations can eliminate the need for customers to repeat information and provide valuable insights to enhance the customer experience.

AI routing is another way organizations can hyper-personalize customer interactions. By understanding a consumer's personality and communication preferences, AI can match them with the best agent or self-service resource. This ensures that customers receive the type of interaction they prefer, whether it's a warm and friendly conversation or quick problem resolution.

AI-powered sales-effectiveness models can also help organizations increase sales by recommending products or services based on customer preferences. For example, travel companies can suggest specific destinations based on whether customers prefer the beach or mountains.

Real-time AI-powered customer satisfaction models allow organizations to monitor sentiment levels during interactions and provide guidance to agents. This ensures that agents can effectively handle customer concerns and turn the call around if necessary. By identifying options for building rapport or demonstrating ownership, AI helps agents provide a better customer experience.

Intelligent bots powered by generative AI have also improved the level of service they can provide. With the addition of semantics, bots can now communicate like human agents. This makes it difficult for customers to discern whether they are speaking with a bot or a human, enhancing the overall customer experience.

However, it is crucial for organizations to choose the right CX AI technology. The AI must be domain-specific and aligned with the organization's brand language and guidelines. This ensures that the insights and knowledge delivered by AI are relevant, accurate, and appropriate. Implementing the wrong AI can damage a brand's reputation and compromise customer loyalty.

In conclusion, CX AI is revolutionizing personalization for organizations. By leveraging tools like interaction-centric cloud CX platforms, AI routing, AI-powered sales-effectiveness models, customer satisfaction models, and intelligent bots, organizations can develop deeper relationships with their customers. However, it is essential to choose the right AI technology to maintain brand reputation and customer loyalty. With CX AI, organizations can deliver exceptional customer experiences and stay ahead in today's competitive market.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fdbcfd2050ee8b6bcdbfc2/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 06:45:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) may seem like two very different companies, but they actually share a lot in common. Both companies stumbled upon their core businesses as a result of happy accidents. AWS realized it could sell its internal services to external customers, while Nvidia discovered that its gaming GPU was well-suited for AI workloads. This led to explosive revenue growth for both companies.

Nvidia's revenue has been growing at an astounding rate, from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024 to $22.1 billion in Q4 2024. However, the majority of this growth came from the company's data center business. While AWS has consistently been a big revenue driver for Amazon, its growth has started to slow down. Microsoft and Google have also entered the market, creating the ""Big Three"" cloud vendors. Other chip makers are expected to gain market share in the future, but the revenue pie is still expected to grow.

Both Nvidia and AWS were in the right place at the right time. As web apps and mobile emerged, the cloud provided on-demand resources, and enterprises saw the value of moving workloads to the cloud. Similarly, as AI and large language models became popular, the use of GPUs for processing these workloads exploded.

AWS has become a tremendously profitable business, projected to reach a run rate close to $100 billion. Nvidia's growth has surpassed AWS's, but the question is whether it can sustain this growth in the long term. If the GPU market tightens, Nvidia does have other businesses, but they are smaller revenue generators that are growing more slowly.

In terms of short-term financial outlook, Nvidia's revenue growth has been astronomical in recent quarters, and it is expected to continue. The company anticipates $24 billion worth of revenue in the current quarter (Q1 FY25), a 234% increase compared to the year-ago quarter. However, its growth rate is expected to decline as the company matures. Analysts project $110.5 billion worth of revenue for the current fiscal year, an 81% increase from the previous year, but significantly lower than the 126% gain in the previous fiscal year.

Despite the expected slowdown, analysts and Nvidia anticipate significant growth for the company in the coming quarters. Nvidia is expected to surpass the $100 billion annual run rate mark, an impressive feat considering its revenue was just $7.19 billion in the same period last year. While growth may slow, the future still looks promising for Nvidia.

Looking ahead, AI could be the key to Nvidia's continued success. Even as competition from AMD, Intel, and other chipmakers increases, Nvidia currently dominates the market. However, AMD is gaining ground at the board level. Nevertheless, Nvidia remains in control and can afford to give up some market share.

In conclusion, Nvidia and AWS have followed similar growth trajectories, benefiting from being in the right place at the right time. Both companies have experienced impressive revenue growth, but Nvidia's growth has surpassed AWS's. While Nvidia faces challenges in sustaining this growth, particularly in a tightening GPU market, the company remains optimistic about its future. AI is expected to be a significant driver of growth for Nvidia, even as competition increases.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/24/new-whatsapp-warning-iphone-15-pro-max-samsung-s24-ultra-upgrade/,New WhatsApp Warning Suddenly Issued For 2 Billion Users,"WhatsApp recently launched a major upgrade, but there's one setting you should avoid at all costs. This setting has the potential to be dangerous for your WhatsApp account. So, what is it? Let's dive into the details.

2024 is set to bring significant changes to the global messaging landscape. From iMessage co-opting RCS to WhatsApp's third-party chat hub and Gemini AI integrating with Google Messages, there's a lot happening. And let's not forget the DOJ lawsuit against Apple, where iMessage plays a central role.

But here's the common theme among these changes: a misunderstanding of end-to-end encryption. Apps like iMessage, WhatsApp, and Signal have been using this encryption for years. Google Messages and Facebook Messenger have also made it their default setting.

End-to-end encryption is so important that WhatsApp has warned users that third-party chats are not as secure as WhatsApp-to-WhatsApp chats. The DOJ has also highlighted how Apple's denial of full iMessage security on Android makes iPhone users less secure. Even Facebook Messenger has adopted end-to-end encryption by default, despite pressure from governments and security agencies.

That's why it's surprising to see some media reports encouraging users to transfer their chats and chat history from WhatsApp to Telegram. While WhatsApp offers an export setting, allowing you to select Telegram as the recipient, this move is alarming.

Why? Because Telegram does not provide end-to-end encryption by default. Its ""secret chat"" option needs to be manually selected for each individual chat. Kaspersky, a cybersecurity company, warned that Telegram isn't as secure as its developers claim. Telegram chats lack end-to-end encryption, and the messenger doesn't inform users about the secure chat option. This raises concerns about privacy.

So, moving chats from end-to-end encrypted WhatsApp to Telegram, which lacks default encryption, is a major security mistake. This is especially true for group chats that contain sensitive content from multiple users.

In contrast, WhatsApp is part of Mark Zuckerberg's data-hungry empire, but it still uses end-to-end encryption by default. Users don't need to do anything. Messages are protected from all outsiders, including service owners, right from the start.

When Telegram first promoted WhatsApp chat migration, I warned that it was a dangerous move for users. This warning came amidst a backlash against WhatsApp after Meta (previously Facebook) threatened to change user terms and conditions. Fortunately, this plan was quickly dropped.

As Jake Moore, a cybersecurity specialist from ESET, advises, extracting content from end-to-end encrypted messaging platforms removes the barriers that protect messages. While accessibility is crucial in today's online world, it shouldn't come at the cost of security and privacy.

Telegram's selling point is its cross-platform usability. Any client can access content on Telegram's central servers, making it remarkably easy to use. However, if it were end-to-end encrypted, this wouldn't be possible.

Telegram also emphasizes reduced smartphone storage, as everything is stored in the cloud. But again, its architecture prioritizes accessibility and simplicity over full encryption. The security of your data is based on policy, not technology.

Considering these factors, I strongly advise against following any advice to switch from WhatsApp to Telegram. It's a step backward, regardless of what the marketing may suggest. Additionally, there are other concerns you should be aware of.

Telegram plays two opposing roles in the messaging world. On one hand, it aims to be an easy-to-use alternative to WhatsApp, which is why it offers the option to migrate chats. On the other hand, Telegram is known for its lack of content controls. Spain's High Court recently suspended Telegram for this reason. The Financial Times has also highlighted Telegram's similarities to the dark web, with some describing it as ""social media for organized criminals.""

While Telegram may attract not just criminals but also campaigners and activists, its rise in recent years has raised eyebrows. It has transformed from a niche messaging app to an indispensable news source and organizing tool, even in geopolitical and human rights contexts.

In conclusion, it's crucial to be cautious when it comes to your messaging app choices. Stick with WhatsApp and its end-to-end encryption for the highest level of security and privacy. Avoid falling for media reports that encourage switching to Telegram, as it lacks default encryption and has its own set of concerns. Your personal data and messages deserve the utmost protection, so make wise choices when it comes to your messaging apps.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65b41420a2b346798e66d370/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2207,1442,x681,y315,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 23:45:00,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.forbes.com/sites/anuradhavaranasi/2024/03/25/the-countries-most-and-least-accepting-of-autistic-individuals/,The Countries Least Accepting Of Autistic Individuals,"A recent survey conducted in eight countries revealed that individuals with autism in Japan and Belgium experience the lowest levels of societal acceptance. The study included participants from the USA, UK, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, and Belgium. While autistic individuals in Canada, the UK, and South Africa reported slightly higher levels of acceptance, only 23.5% of participants across all countries felt accepted by society as someone with autism.

The survey defined autism acceptance as an individual feeling acknowledged and appreciated for their autistic identity, with autism being seen as a positive and integral part of their being. The researchers noted that autistic individuals face a higher risk of psychiatric and mental health disorders throughout their lives, as well as a significantly higher risk of premature mortality compared to their non-autistic peers. The most common psychiatric co-morbidities reported by autistic adults are depression and anxiety, with prevalence rates reaching as high as 47% and 54%, respectively.

Several factors contribute to the elevated mental health difficulties experienced by individuals with autism. One such factor is the higher prevalence of alexithymia, a subclinical condition characterized by difficulties in identifying, expressing, and differentiating emotions, in the autistic population. Autistic individuals also belong to a marginalized minority group and face various ""minority stressors,"" including everyday discrimination and internalized stigma.

Despite these challenges, research on autism acceptance and its impact on mental health has been limited until recently. The majority of autistic individuals in the UK feel that society either does not accept or only sometimes accepts them as autistic individuals. This lack of acceptance has significant implications for their mental well-being.

Autistic individuals often feel compelled to camouflage their autistic traits to avoid rejection or discrimination. Camouflaging refers to the use of strategies by autistic people to minimize the visibility of their autism in social situations. This may involve learning how to use eye contact, developing scripts to navigate social interactions, or suppressing stimming behaviors, which are repetitive movements that help regulate emotions and sensory experiences.

Camouflaging is more prevalent among autistic women and those with higher levels of autistic traits. Research suggests that camouflaging can be a risk factor for depression and anxiety in autism, regardless of gender. Autistic individuals who experience greater social stressors, such as a lack of autism acceptance, are more likely to camouflage their traits, resulting in higher levels of anxiety and depression.

Lead author of the study, Connor Keating from the University of Birmingham's School of Psychology, emphasized the need to combat the stigma surrounding autism and reduce the pressure on autistic individuals to hide their true selves. By promoting acceptance and understanding, society can create a more inclusive environment for individuals with autism.

The study was published in PLoS One on March 20, 2024.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66011516945f390030af66b1/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 03:06:35,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/03/25/selfies-can-no-longer-prove-humanness-online-how-to-get-ahead-of-it/,Selfies Can No Longer Prove Humanness Online-How To Get Ahead Of It,"The year 2024 started with a viral post about AI that left many amazed. Reddit user _harsh_ shared an AI-generated selfie on the subreddit r/StableDiffusion, demonstrating the technology's ability to surpass humanness verification checks used by online apps and services. This incident highlighted the increasing blurring of lines between humans and machines due to the rise of AI.

The impact of AI bots goes beyond fooling verification tests. Retail businesses are losing billions of dollars annually due to return fraud, bots, and coupon stacking. Additionally, the digital gaming industry is facing challenges from bots that fraudulently beat human players in competitive games. As a response to these issues, a bipartisan federal bill has been introduced to protect against deepfakes. However, this is just the beginning, as bots are expected to become more frequent and sophisticated in their attacks in the coming years.

To address the problem of proving humanness online, leveraging government IDs to create digital identities is often suggested. However, this solution has its drawbacks. Firstly, government IDs are not private, as governments can access the information stored in centralized databases. This raises concerns about privacy and the potential misuse of personal information by malicious actors. Secondly, not everyone has a valid government ID or a digitally verifiable form of identification. This means that relying solely on government IDs for human verification would exclude a significant portion of the population.

So, how can we create a digital identity solution that is both privacy-preserving and inclusive? Two existing technologies can help in this regard: blockchain and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). Blockchain, with its decentralized nature, reduces the risk of exploitation by a central authority. However, it does not inherently maintain privacy, as user addresses can be traced back to specific individuals. On the other hand, ZKPs allow for the proof of an event without revealing specific details, which enhances privacy and scalability.

While blockchain and ZKPs provide some solutions, there is still a need for a mechanism to reliably differentiate humans from bots. One approach is the ""web of trust,"" where individuals meet in person to verify each other's identity. However, this method becomes challenging to scale when considering billions of people worldwide. Another option is using social graphs to determine the authenticity of individuals based on their relationships. However, this approach lacks the ability to verify unique humanness.

In conclusion, the challenge of proving humanness online requires innovative solutions that balance privacy and inclusivity. Leveraging technologies like blockchain and ZKPs can help address some of these challenges. However, a reliable mechanism for verifying humanness is still needed. As AI continues to advance, it is crucial to find effective ways to protect identities, personal data, and finances in the digital realm.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fdac36ce306ad3e0975f80/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 06:00:00,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/apple-sued-microsofts-ai-ambitions-and-nvidia-surprises/,"Apple sued, Microsoft's AI ambitions and Nvidia's surprises","Welcome to this edition of Week in Review, where we bring you the latest updates on Apple's antitrust lawsuit and Microsoft's AI ambitions. Let's dive right in!

The U.S. has joined international regulators in accusing Apple of using monopolistic tactics to lock in iPhone users. In response, Apple argues that the Department of Justice's actions could jeopardize what its users enjoy about its phones and ecosystem.

While the DOJ's lawsuit draws a parallel between Apple and Microsoft's practices in the 1990s, there are distinct differences between the two companies and their strategies to retain customers.

However, experts predict that the lawsuit won't yield immediate results. It could take three to five years for the case to reach a resolution.

But that's not all. Let's move on to other updates, including Reddit's IPO, Nvidia's GTC event, and an unexpected change for Glassdoor accounts.

In other news, Microsoft has acquired the co-founders of Inflection AI, a prominent AI startup. Mustafa Suleyman will now lead Microsoft's consumer-facing unit, Microsoft AI, while Karén Simonyan becomes the EVP and CEO of the same group. Inflection AI recently raised $1.3 billion, with Microsoft being its largest investor.

At Nvidia's GTC developer conference, CEO Jensen Huang surprised attendees with several announcements. He predicted that artificial general intelligence would be achievable within the next five years. Additionally, Nvidia unveiled GR00T, a new AI platform for humanoid robots.

Google and Apple are reportedly in talks about deploying Google's AI model on upcoming iOS updates. It remains unclear whether this collaboration is a temporary solution until Apple's own AI efforts catch up, a long-term partnership, or a negotiation that may never come to fruition.

Now let's shift our focus to hacking and privacy concerns. The Biden administration is rallying an international coalition to combat commercial spyware. Interestingly, some investors joining the coalition were previously involved in the very business they are now fighting against.

In the gaming world, a hack disrupted a $5 million Apex Legends tournament. The hacker claimed it was done for fun and to bring attention to the exploit used. Meanwhile, Glassdoor users have reported that their real names are being added to their profiles without consent. The only solution offered to them is to delete their accounts entirely.

Moving on to funding and IPO news, Reddit's IPO had a strong start. The stock price jumped 48% on its first day, closing at $46 after the market closed on Friday.

Astera Labs, a company specializing in connectivity hardware for cloud computing data centers, experienced a successful first day of trading. Its revenue grew by 45% to $115.8 million last year, and its stock closed at $62.03 on day one.

The Browser Company, the startup behind the Arc browser, has raised $50 million at a valuation of $550 million. The company has an ambitious plan to replace PCs with browsers but has yet to clearly outline its path to monetization.

In our bonus round, we explore why AI-generated images often have spelling errors. Despite its vast potential, AI still struggles with basic spelling, including words like ""burrito.""

Lastly, Fisker, an electric vehicle manufacturer, has paused production due to financial difficulties. If the company fails to secure additional funding, it may cease operations altogether.

In conclusion, while AI systems like ChatGPT or Gemini cannot be fully reviewed, it is essential to put them to the test to ensure their reliability and effectiveness.
