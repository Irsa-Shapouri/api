Igor Severino, making his UFC debut, shocked everyone when he bit his opponent, Andre Lima, during their preliminary bout. This act of unsportsmanlike conduct occurred in the second round while Severino was in a standing grappling position behind Lima.

The bite marks, confirmed by images, left no room for doubt, leading to Severino's disqualification. This unfortunate incident not only tarnished Severino's reputation but also jeopardized his future in the promotion. The 20-year-old had a chance to establish himself in the UFC, but his actions on Saturday made it difficult for him to earn another opportunity.

Severino's loss to Lima marked the first defeat of his career, dropping his record to 9-1 with the disqualification. On the other hand, Lima maintained his undefeated streak, improving to 8-0. The severity of the situation was emphasized by UFC CEO Dana White, who wasted no time in cutting Severino from the roster. White expressed his disappointment, stating, ""Those were two up-and-coming undefeated fighters. If you get frustrated and want to quit, there are plenty of ways to do it, but biting your opponent is the worst thing you can do. Now, you not only lose your chance at the biggest opportunity of your life, but you'll also face repercussions from the NSAC.""

While biting incidents are not unheard of in combat sports, they remain deeply frowned upon. In this particular case, Lima displayed remarkable composure, calmly informing the referee about the bite and initiating a brief investigation into the matter. Severino now faces the daunting task of rebuilding his reputation through smaller promotions before he can even think of competing in the UFC, the Professional Fighters League, or any other respected mixed martial arts organization.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/23/explained-the-difference-between-a-solar-eclipse-and-a-lunar-eclipse/,Explained: The Difference Between A Solar Eclipse And A Lunar Eclipse,"Do you know the difference between a solar eclipse and a lunar eclipse? In the next few weeks, we will witness two celestial events—an upcoming lunar eclipse on Monday, March 25, and a solar eclipse on Monday, April 8. While these phenomena are distinct, they both occur due to a similar alignment of celestial bodies.

Let's first understand what causes a lunar eclipse. This type of eclipse can only happen during a full moon when the Earth is positioned between the sun and the moon, casting a shadow into space. Although full moons occur every 29 days, it is rare for the moon to pass through Earth's shadow. When it does, we witness a lunar eclipse.

On the other hand, a solar eclipse can only occur during a new moon when the moon is positioned between the sun and Earth, casting a shadow onto our planet. New moons happen every 29 days, approximately two weeks after a full moon. However, it is uncommon for the moon to block the sun as seen from Earth. When this alignment occurs, a solar eclipse takes place.

Now, let's dive into the specifics of each type of eclipse. During a total lunar eclipse, a perfect alignment of the sun, Earth, and moon occurs. Earth possesses two shadows—the fuzzy outer penumbral shadow and the dark central umbral shadow. When a full moon enters Earth's umbra, it receives no direct sunlight. The only light reaching its surface is sunlight refracted by Earth's atmosphere. This unique phenomenon creates a breathtaking sight—a thousand sunsets on the lunar surface, resulting in a pinkish-red hue known as the ""Blood Moon."" If one were to stand on the moon during a lunar eclipse, they would be bathed in this pinkish-red light, experiencing a partial or total solar eclipse.

On March 25, we will witness a penumbral lunar eclipse, as the full ""Worm Moon"" moves through Earth's penumbra, the outer part of its shadow.

Similarly, a total solar eclipse occurs due to a perfect alignment of the sun, moon, and Earth, combined with a celestial fluke. A new moon possesses two shadows—the fuzzy outer penumbral shadow and the dark central umbral shadow. Only when the new moon completely blocks the sun, which is possible because the moon is 400 times smaller but also 400 times closer to Earth, its umbra is projected onto our planet.

The shadow of the moon moves across Earth's surface as it orbits from west to east, matching the direction of Earth's rotation. This synchronization slows down the movement of the moon's shadow, creating a path of totality called the umbral shadow. Within this path, observers witness an awe-inspiring sight—a total solar eclipse. If one were on the moon during a total solar eclipse, they would witness the moon's shadow traversing Earth.

On April 8, a total solar eclipse will occur as the new ""Pink Moon"" perfectly aligns with the sun, casting an umbral shadow over North America.

Now, you may wonder why lunar and solar eclipses are rare occurrences. This rarity can be attributed to the tilt of the moon's orbit around Earth, which is about 5 degrees in relation to the sun's path through the sky. Due to this tilt, the moon's path intersects with the sun twice during each orbit (approximately every month), but for an eclipse to occur, the moon must be in its new or full phase. These conditions are met twice a year, resulting in two ""eclipse seasons"" during which solar and lunar eclipses are more likely. However, most solar eclipses are either partial or annular (resembling a ""ring of fire""), while most lunar eclipses are penumbral or partial.

Looking ahead to future eclipses, in 2024, we can expect two eclipse seasons starting on March 25 and September 17, featuring a penumbral lunar eclipse, a total solar eclipse, a partial lunar eclipse, and an annular solar eclipse, visible in North America, the Pacific Ocean, South America, and other regions.

In 2025, two more eclipse seasons will occur starting on March 13 and September 7, showcasing a total lunar eclipse, a partial solar eclipse, and another total lunar eclipse. These events will be visible in North America, Canada, northern Europe, Asia, and Antarctica.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/24/debunked-i-think-ive-seen-a-total-solar-eclipse-before/,Debunked: ‘I Think I’ve Seen A Total Solar Eclipse Before’,"If you believe you have witnessed a total solar eclipse, you are most likely mistaken. Eclipse chasers often say that if you think you've seen one, you haven't. People often confuse total solar eclipses with partial solar eclipses, which occur twice a year in various parts of the world. However, those who have truly experienced totality, where the moon completely blocks the sun, never forget the awe-inspiring event.

Seeing a total solar eclipse requires significant effort, as you must be in the path of totality. This path is the area on Earth where the moon entirely obscures the sun. If you are outside this path, you will only witness a partial solar eclipse. Therefore, eclipse chasers are skeptical when someone claims to have seen a total solar eclipse without being in the path of totality.

Nevertheless, many people in North America have indeed witnessed a total solar eclipse. The continent is currently in a golden age of eclipses, with the most recent being the ""Great American Eclipse"" in 2017. This event brought totality to 12 U.S. states, from Oregon to South Carolina, and approximately 12 million people lived within its path. Another one million individuals traveled to witness this extraordinary phenomenon. If you were on the path of totality, you would vividly remember the twilight-like sky, the moon's silhouette, and the breathtaking sight of the sun's corona encircling it. Such an experience becomes etched in one's memory forever.

If you believe you saw a total solar eclipse during school or work, it is likely that your memory is from 2017 when North America witnessed a partial solar eclipse. However, there have been other solar eclipses on the continent within living memory. To confirm whether you witnessed a total solar eclipse, you can use the Solar Eclipses Visibility Database to determine the location and date of the event.

To help clarify the distinction between partial and total solar eclipses, GreatAmericanEclipse.com provides a list of all the total solar eclipses that have occurred in North America over the past 70 years. Each eclipse is accompanied by an interactive map. If you were not within the specified areas on those specific dates, you did not experience a total solar eclipse. If the dates are not listed, it means it was a partial solar eclipse.

The next total solar eclipse in North America will occur on April 8, 2024. While everyone on the continent will witness a partial solar eclipse, only those within a narrow 115-mile path spanning parts of Mexico, 15 U.S. states, and Canada will be able to experience totality. This path will traverse five states in Mexico, 15 U.S. states, and six Canadian provinces. Approximately 42 million people, including 32 million Americans, already reside within the path of totality, making this a shared experience for many.

If you encounter someone who believes they have seen a total solar eclipse, ask them to describe the event in detail, including when and where it occurred. Then, gently inform them about the upcoming total solar eclipse on April 8, 2024. This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity will allow them to finally experience totality and join the exclusive group of individuals who have witnessed this remarkable phenomenon. It is estimated that 42 million people, including 32 million Americans, will have the chance to witness this awe-inspiring event.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2024/03/24/epa-didnt-ban-gas-cars-it-cut-air-pollution-so-we-can-breathe-easier/,EPA Didn’t Ban Gas Cars. It Cut Air Pollution So We Can Breathe Easier.,"On days when the air quality is labeled as red, the taste of pollution lingers in the air, leaving a harsh sensation in your nose and throat. During these times, individuals, especially vulnerable populations like the elderly and those with respiratory conditions, are advised to stay indoors to avoid the harmful effects of pollution.

It may come as no surprise that the primary source of toxic air pollution in many areas stems from internal combustion engines powered by gasoline or diesel. With the majority of Americans relying on personal vehicles for daily transportation, it's no wonder that the transportation sector is the leading contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. In fact, light-duty vehicles alone are responsible for nearly 60% of the climate pollution from this sector.

Addressing the pervasive issue of air pollution necessitates a focus on reducing tailpipe emissions from vehicles. Fortunately, there is a solution at hand to help us achieve cleaner air: tailpipe emissions standards. Recently, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency took a significant step by implementing new rules that limit pollution from light-duty and smaller medium-duty vehicles. These updated standards push automakers to adopt cleaner technologies, ensuring that new vehicles will be more environmentally friendly than ever before.

The ability to choose a clean car should be a right for everyone. Those who are passionate about reducing pollution should have the option to drive electric vehicles. Despite the benefits of cleaner air and improved public health, some entities see these standards as a hindrance. Corporations that profit from selling polluting vehicles and petroleum products often portray these regulations as a threat to consumer choice and freedom.

In reality, these updated pollution limits are long overdue and will ultimately benefit all Americans by improving air quality and providing consumers with alternatives to costly fossil fuels. While certain groups launch disinformation campaigns to discredit the EPA's efforts, it's essential to recognize that the standards are based on scientific research and aimed at protecting public health.

The Clean Air Act, enacted in 1970, empowers the EPA to establish air quality standards to safeguard public health and regulate emissions from vehicles and engines. Over time, these standards have driven technological advancements in engine efficiency and emission control, leading to significant reductions in harmful pollutants. Prior to the implementation of the Clean Air Act, cities like New York and Los Angeles grappled with severe air pollution, highlighting the urgent need for regulatory measures to protect our environment and health.

In conclusion, the recent actions taken by the EPA to limit tailpipe emissions represent a crucial step towards cleaner air and a healthier future for all Americans. By embracing cleaner technologies and reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, we can pave the way for a more sustainable and environmentally conscious transportation system. Let's support these efforts to ensure that everyone can breathe cleaner air and enjoy a healthier, more vibrant future.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fe401fc35aefb76700b52e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 07:45:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/anuradhavaranasi/2024/03/24/which-adhd-medications-could-lower-risk-of-suicide--hospitalization/,Which ADHD Medications Could Lower Risk Of Suicide & Hospitalization?,"ADHD Medications Linked to Lower Risk of Suicide Attempts and Psychiatric Hospitalizations

A recent study involving over 200,000 individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) revealed a significant finding: those prescribed ADHD stimulant medications had a reduced risk of suicide attempts and psychiatric hospitalizations. Heidi Taipale and her team at Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, discovered that four specific ADHD medications—amphetamine, lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate—were associated with a decreased likelihood of psychiatric hospitalizations.

Notably, lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate were also linked to a lower risk of suicidal behavior. Previous research in Sweden indicated that individuals with ADHD had a high prevalence of psychiatric co-morbidities, including major depressive disorder, panic disorder, substance abuse, and more. These co-morbidities significantly increased the risk of mortality, especially when substance use disorder was present.

While atomoxetine did not show a reduction in psychiatric hospitalizations or suicidal behavior, it was associated with fewer hospitalizations for non-psychiatric co-morbidities. The researchers emphasized the overall positive impact of ADHD medications on psychiatric outcomes, despite potential concerns about long-term use and side effects.

The study, published in JAMA Network Open on March 20, 2024, followed individuals aged 16 to 65 with ADHD diagnoses in Sweden from 2006 to 2021. Data from the Swedish National Patient Register and the Prescribed Drug Register were analyzed to track medication use and healthcare outcomes. Methylphenidate was the most commonly prescribed ADHD medication, followed by lisdexamphetamine and atomoxetine.

Interestingly, the study found variations in medication effectiveness based on age and gender. Lisdexamphetamine was particularly beneficial for reducing psychiatric hospitalizations across different age groups, while methylphenidate appeared less effective in older adults. Atomoxetine showed a decreased risk of hospitalization in women but not men.

Overall, the study highlighted the positive impact of ADHD medications on psychiatric outcomes, emphasizing the need for further research on long-term effectiveness and safety. By identifying specific medications associated with improved mental health outcomes, healthcare providers can better tailor treatment plans for individuals with ADHD.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/63c28dbb82c31b7412c92cf2/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 04:09:46,Innovation,Innovation
