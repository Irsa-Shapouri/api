https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-vulnerability-virtual-reality.html,Vulnerability in virtual reality systems identified,"Virtual reality (VR) systems have opened up a whole new world of possibilities, allowing users to immerse themselves in virtual environments. However, a team of computer scientists at the University of Chicago has recently discovered a potential vulnerability in VR systems that could expose users to a new type of attack. They have coined this attack method as ""inception attacks,"" and it involves inserting an ""inception layer"" between a user's VR Home Screen and their VR User/Server.

In a paper published on the arXiv preprint server, the researchers outline how hackers could exploit this vulnerability to manipulate users and gain access to sensitive information. The idea behind the inception layer is to create a simulated VR app that runs inside the attacker's layer, tricking users into behaving in ways that reveal personal or confidential data.

To illustrate this concept, the researchers draw parallels with the movie ""Inception,"" where a character played by Leonardo DiCaprio has an altered reality downloaded into his brain. Similarly, the researchers suggest that an inception layer could be added between the user and the virtual world they see through their VR device.

By doing so, hackers could record information entered by users, such as passcodes for virtual ATMs. They could also intercept and modify transaction details, redirecting funds to their own accounts. Additionally, the inception layer could introduce virtual characters representing the user's friends or family, using social engineering tactics to gain trust and extract sensitive information.

The researchers emphasize that such an app could be downloaded onto a user's VR device if the hacker gains access to their WiFi network or physical device. Once installed, the app would run discreetly without the user's knowledge. To test the effectiveness of this attack method, the researchers enlisted the help of 28 volunteers who played a game using a demonstration VR headset. They downloaded an app onto the devices, simulating a hack, and asked the volunteers if they noticed anything unusual. Only 10 of the volunteers noticed a slight flickering, and only one questioned the possibility of a malicious activity.

Upon discovering these vulnerabilities, the research team promptly alerted Meta, the manufacturer of the Meta Quest VR system used in the experiment. Meta responded by expressing their intent to investigate the issue and address it if confirmed. The researchers also caution that similar vulnerabilities are likely to exist in other VR systems and apps that attempt to insert themselves between users and their VR devices.

In conclusion, while VR technology offers incredible immersive experiences, it is crucial to remain vigilant about potential security risks. The concept of inception attacks highlights the need for constant vigilance and robust security measures in VR systems to protect users from malicious activities. The research team's findings serve as a reminder that as technology advances, so do the tactics employed by hackers, emphasizing the importance of ongoing research and development in the field of cybersecurity.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/vulnerability-in-virtu.jpg,2024-03-25 10:20:02,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-liquid-iron-battery-grid-energy.html,New all-liquid iron flow battery for grid energy storage,"A New Battery Design for Large-Scale Energy Storage

In a breakthrough discovery, researchers at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have repurposed a commonplace chemical used in water treatment facilities to create a new battery design for large-scale energy storage. This design offers a safe, economical, water-based, flow battery made with Earth-abundant materials, providing an innovative solution for incorporating intermittent energy sources like wind and solar energy into the nation's electric grid.

The researchers, led by battery researcher Gabriel Nambafu, have published their findings in Nature Communications. They have developed an iron-based battery that exhibits remarkable cycling stability, maintaining 98.7% of its maximum capacity over one thousand consecutive charging cycles. This is a significant improvement compared to previous studies, where similar iron-based batteries experienced degradation of the charge capacity at a much higher rate over fewer charging cycles.

Iron-based flow batteries have been around since the 1980s and are already commercially available. However, what sets this battery apart is its unique liquid chemical formula. It combines charged iron with a neutral-pH phosphate-based liquid electrolyte, or energy carrier. The key component of this formula is a chemical called nitrogenous triphosphonate, nitrilotri-methylphosphonic acid or NTMPA, which is commercially available in industrial quantities due to its use in inhibiting corrosion in water treatment plants.

NTMPA is part of a broad chemical family called phosphonates, which are based on the element phosphorus. Many phosphonates are water-soluble and nontoxic, making them safe for various applications such as fertilizers and detergents. In this battery design, NTMPA acts as an electrolyte that binds and stores charged iron in a liquid complex at room temperature and neutral pH, fulfilling the researchers' goal of developing battery materials that are Earth-abundant and domestically sourced.

But what exactly is a flow battery? Flow batteries consist of two chambers, each filled with a different liquid. Through an electrochemical reaction, these batteries charge and store energy in chemical bonds. When connected to an external circuit, they release that energy to power electrical devices. Unlike conventional batteries, flow batteries feature two external supply tanks of liquid that continuously circulate through them, supplying the electrolyte. The size of the electrolyte supply tank determines the amount of energy the flow battery can store.

Flow batteries have the potential to serve as backup generators for the electric grid. They are a crucial component of decarbonization strategies that aim to store energy from renewable sources. One advantage of flow batteries is their scalability, from lab-bench scale to the size of a city block. Grid operators can strategically place battery energy storage systems (BESS) in urban or suburban areas near energy consumers. The aqueous flow battery design developed by the researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory offers an additional advantage of operating in water at neutral pH, which can address safety concerns often raised by city planners.

The initial design of this flow battery has achieved an energy density of up to 9 watt-hours per liter (Wh/L), which is a key design feature. However, commercialized vanadium-based systems currently have an energy density of 25 Wh/L, more than twice that of the iron-based battery. Higher energy density batteries can store more energy in a smaller space. Nevertheless, a system built with Earth-abundant materials can be scaled up to provide the same energy output.

The future development of flow batteries holds promise for modernizing the U.S. electric grid and integrating renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. The research conducted by the team at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory has paved the way for a safe, economical, and efficient battery design that utilizes Earth-abundant materials. By repurposing a commonplace chemical, they have opened new possibilities for large-scale energy storage and a sustainable energy future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/new-all-liquid-iron-fl.jpg,2024-03-25 07:22:25,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-quantum-algorithm-high-quality-solutions.html,Novel quantum algorithm proposed for high-quality solutions to combinatorial optimization problems,"Combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) are complex problems that have applications in various fields such as logistics, supply chain management, machine learning, material design, and drug discovery. These problems require finding the optimal solution, but they are computationally intensive for classical computers. As a result, there has been significant interest in solving COPs using quantum computers.

Quantum computers leverage the quantum property of superposition, using qubits that can exist in multiple states simultaneously, to solve large problems quickly. However, when COPs involve constraints, traditional quantum algorithms struggle to find near-optimal solutions within the time frame of quantum computers' operations.

To address this challenge, Assistant Professor Tatsuhiko Shirai and Professor Nozomu Togawa from Waseda University in Japan have developed a post-processing variationally scheduled quantum algorithm (pVSQA). This algorithm combines variational scheduling with a post-processing method to transform infeasible solutions into feasible ones, allowing for near-optimal solutions for constrained COPs on both quantum annealers and gate-based quantum computers.

The pVSQA algorithm starts by using a quantum device to generate a variational quantum state through quantum computation. This state then generates a probability distribution function that includes both feasible and infeasible solutions within the constraints of the COP. The post-processing method is then applied to transform the infeasible solutions into feasible ones, resulting in a probability distribution with only feasible solutions. A classical computer calculates the energy expectation value of the cost function using this new probability distribution, and repeating this calculation leads to a near-optimal solution.

To evaluate the performance of the pVSQA algorithm, the researchers conducted experiments using both a simulator and real quantum devices like a quantum annealer and a gate-type quantum device. The results showed that pVSQA achieves near-optimal performance within a predetermined time on the simulator and outperforms conventional quantum algorithms without post-processing on real quantum devices.

This innovative approach to solving COPs using quantum computers has significant implications for addressing real-world problems in various domains. The researchers emphasize the importance of efficiently solving combinatorial optimization problems in achieving social transformations, such as realizing a carbon-neutral society and sustainable development goals.

In conclusion, the development of the pVSQA algorithm represents a significant advancement in utilizing quantum computers for solving COPs. It holds promise for tackling complex real-world problems and contributing to societal transformations.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/novel-quantum-algorith.jpg,2024-03-25 12:50:38,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.zdnet.com/article/saving-hours-of-work-with-ai-how-chatgpt-became-my-virtual-assistant-for-a-data-project/,Saving hours of work with AI: How ChatGPT became my virtual assistant for a data project,"Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been making headlines lately, and tools like ChatGPT have been at the forefront of the conversation. While there's been a lot of hype surrounding these AI tools, it's important to remember that they are just tools that can assist with various projects. In this article, I'll walk you through a project where ChatGPT saved me a significant amount of time and effort, and hopefully inspire you to consider using it for your own projects.

The project I embarked on involved creating a ""stunt article"" where I would showcase how much computer gear I could buy from Temu for under $100. To stay within budget, I needed to find affordable items on the Temu site and keep track of their prices in a spreadsheet. However, the challenge was converting the Temu links into something more useful, and that's where ChatGPT came to the rescue.

Phase 1 of the project involved gathering all the links from Temu. I copied each link and pasted it into a Notion page, which allowed me to create bookmark blocks containing not only the links but also the product names. Once I had selected all the blocks, I copied them and pasted them into a text editor. Although the page may have looked messy, the result was a useful collection of links and names.

Phase 2 focused on identifying the relevant data within the blocks. Each block consisted of three key elements: the product name, the base URL, and unnecessary tracking data. I wanted ChatGPT to extract the titles and links while disregarding the rest. To teach ChatGPT how to recognize the data, I provided it with a prompt explaining the structure of the blocks and the desired output format.

Phase 3 involved feeding ChatGPT the prompt and the information from the text editor. At this point, ChatGPT knew to wait for further instructions. The crucial step was to instruct ChatGPT to extract the titles and URLs while discarding the excess information. This step allowed me to test ChatGPT's understanding and ensure it was on the right track.

Although ChatGPT initially stopped two-thirds of the way through due to its buffer running out, I prompted it to continue, and it successfully completed the task. This saved me a significant amount of time compared to manually cutting and pasting the information.

In Phase 4, I focused on cleaning up the overly complex titles provided by Temu. For the sake of my project, I wanted shorter and more concise titles. I assigned this task to ChatGPT as well, reminding it of the previous step where it had parsed and identified the data. By giving ChatGPT this context, it was able to generate simpler titles that better suited my needs.

Overall, ChatGPT proved to be a valuable workhorse tool for this project. It efficiently gathered and organized the Temu links, extracted the necessary data, and even helped simplify the titles. What would have taken me hours to complete manually, ChatGPT accomplished in less than a minute.

While this specific project may not be applicable to your needs, I hope it inspires you to explore the potential of ChatGPT as a productivity tool for your own projects. Whether it's data extraction, content generation, or other tasks, ChatGPT has the potential to save you time and effort.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/70d8814af33b190ff84b8faa5f9bafe13d3586e2/2024/03/25/7d1cb1ff-3bb7-4972-a6cd-33d04da76bc1/cover.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/25/total-eclipse-of-the-chatbot-why-not-to-ask-chatgpt-about-aprils-rare-event/,Total Eclipse Of The Chatbot: Why Not To Ask ChatGPT About April’s Rare Event,"When it comes to the topic of total solar eclipses, the limitations of AI chatbots become apparent. Despite their vast knowledge in many areas, they often fail to provide accurate and up-to-date information on celestial events. One popular AI chatbot, ChatGPT, falls short in answering the simple question of when the next total solar eclipse will occur. Its responses are inconsistent, biased towards events in the United States, and sometimes completely wrong.

For instance, when asked about the next total solar eclipse, ChatGPT initially provides incorrect information, stating that it happened three and a half years ago on another continent. It claims that the next one will occur on December 14, 2020, visible from parts of South America. However, this information is irrelevant and outdated. The correct answer is that the next total solar eclipse will take place on April 8, 2024, and will be visible from parts of North America, including Mexico, the United States, and Canada.

Curious to test its accuracy further, I asked ChatGPT about the next total solar eclipse after April 8, 2024. Surprisingly, it replied with an odd response, stating that it would occur on August 23, 2044. While there will indeed be a total solar eclipse on that date, it is not the next one. Between April 8, 2024, and August 23, 2044, there will be 13 total solar eclipses, with the next one after April 8, 2024, scheduled for August 12, 2026, in Greenland, Iceland, and Spain. It seems that ChatGPT's focus is primarily on events happening in the contiguous United States, disregarding other significant eclipses.

To further test its accuracy, I asked ChatGPT about the total solar eclipse after August 23, 2044. It replied with a false statement, claiming that it would happen on March 20, 2053. However, the actual next total solar eclipse after August 23, 2044, is on August 12, 2045, and it is considered the ""Greatest American Eclipse"" of all. While there is an eclipse on March 20, 2053, it is not a total solar eclipse. These inaccuracies and inconsistencies raise concerns about ChatGPT's reliability when it comes to celestial events.

Fortunately, there is another AI model engine called ""Gemini,"" formerly known as ""Bard,"" developed by Google. Gemini proves to be much more reliable and accurate in providing information about total solar eclipses. It confidently states that the very next total solar eclipse will occur on April 8, 2024, visible across parts of North America. It even goes the extra mile and informs me that I will be able to witness it from my location. Subsequent questions yield consistent and accurate answers.

It is disheartening to realize that AI, despite its vast capabilities, lacks knowledge about celestial events that have been carefully calculated for thousands of years into the future. This revelation emphasizes the need for human expertise and reliable sources when it comes to eclipse chasing. If you are interested in the latest updates on total solar eclipses, including travel and lodging options, I encourage you to check my main feed for new articles each day.

In conclusion, while AI chatbots like ChatGPT may be effective tools for various tasks, they are unreliable and inadequate when it comes to providing accurate and up-to-date information about total solar eclipses. Their inconsistencies, biases, and frequent inaccuracies make them unsuitable for eclipse enthusiasts. Therefore, it is crucial to rely on trusted sources and human expertise for the most reliable and informative insights into celestial events.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/webroot/2024/03/25/9-tips-to-protect-your-family-against-identity-theft-and-credit-and-bank-fraud/,9 Tips To Protect Your Family Against Identity Theft And Credit And Bank Fraud,"Did you know that identity theft affects more than nine million Americans each year? With your personal information stored in various databases, criminals have ample opportunities to steal your identity and wreak havoc on your financial and personal life. But fear not! There are steps you can take to protect yourself and your loved ones from falling victim to identity theft and fraud.

1. Safeguard your personal information: Your name, address, date of birth, and social security number are all prime targets for identity thieves. Protect yourself by shredding documents that contain personal information and avoid sharing such details over the phone or through email whenever possible.

2. Use strong and unique passwords: Your online accounts are only as secure as your passwords. Create passwords that are at least eight characters long and include a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using the same password for multiple accounts, as hackers can easily gain access to multiple sites if they crack one password.

To make managing multiple passwords easier, consider using a password manager. These tools generate and store strong passwords in a secure vault, requiring you to remember only one master password.

3. Regularly monitor your accounts: Stay vigilant by regularly checking your bank and credit card statements for any unauthorized transactions. If you spot any suspicious activity, report it immediately to your financial institution.

4. Beware of phishing scams: Criminals often disguise themselves as legitimate entities, such as banks or credit card companies, in phishing scams. These scams typically involve emails or text messages that ask for personal information or prompt you to click on malicious links. Always double-check the source of any message and refrain from providing personal information or clicking on links unless you are certain of their legitimacy.

5. Enable two-factor authentication: Add an extra layer of security to your online accounts by enabling two-factor authentication. This method requires you to provide a second form of identification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password. Even if your account information is compromised, attackers won't be able to access your account without the secondary identification.

6. Secure your devices and connections: Ensure the safety of your computers, smartphones, and other devices by keeping them up to date with antivirus software and password protection. Avoid using public Wi-Fi networks to access sensitive information, as they are often unsecured. If necessary, use a virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt your connection and protect your identity.

7. Keep an eye on your credit reports: Take advantage of the free annual credit reports offered by the three major credit bureaus. Regularly review your reports for any suspicious activity, such as unauthorized accounts or loans. Consider using a reputable credit monitoring service for real-time alerts and additional protection.

8. Stay informed about the latest scams: Cybercriminals are constantly evolving their tactics, especially with the advancements in artificial intelligence. Stay updated on the latest scam techniques by following reputable cybersecurity experts and reliable news outlets. Be cautious of unsolicited emails and messages, and always verify a person's identity before sharing any personal information.

9. Invest in identity protection for your family: For comprehensive identity protection, consider investing in a package like Webroot Premium. This package offers protection against viruses, malware, scams, and other cyber threats. It also provides password management to safeguard your credentials. Additionally, it covers up to 10 family members, including you, your partner, your children, and even seniors aged 65+.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2024/03/25/amid-fintech-slowdown-goldman-sachs-backed-startup-considers-sale-sources-say/,"Amid Fintech Slowdown, Goldman Sachs-Backed Startup Considers Sale","Deserve, a Silicon Valley startup specializing in helping companies launch and manage credit cards, is currently facing challenges due to a slowdown in business and a dry funding market. The company, backed by high-profile investors such as Goldman Sachs, Visa, Mastercard, and Accel, was valued at $500 million in 2021. However, it has recently explored the possibility of selling itself, and potential buyers have shown interest in its financials. Despite these discussions, Deserve's founder and CEO, Kalpesh Kapadia, stated that the company is not for sale and continues to focus on strategic partnerships, investments, and mergers and acquisitions to drive growth.

Since its establishment in 2013, Deserve has raised $150 million in equity funding but has yet to turn a profit. It reportedly burned through $15 million to $20 million in 2023; however, Kapadia anticipates strong growth in the coming year and aims to reduce the burn rate. Deserve aims to build a self-sustaining, profitable standalone business by leveraging its sales pipeline of banks, fintechs, and brand partners.

Industry insiders predict that if Deserve were to be sold, its valuation would be significantly lower than its peak in 2021. This is due not only to the overall decline in fintech valuations but also to Deserve's unique challenge. In 2021, the company planned to collaborate with crypto lenders to issue credit cards, and its largest customer at the time was crypto lender BlockFi. However, after BlockFi's bankruptcy, Deserve faced significant setbacks.

Deserve's founder, Kalpesh Kapadia, originally came to the United States from India to pursue graduate studies. After working in finance for 15 years, he founded Deserve with the intention of creating a consumer credit card company that catered to underserved populations, such as immigrants and students. The company launched its first card in 2016 and secured backing from venture firms like Accel and Aspect Ventures. Initially, Deserve funded its loans through its own balance sheet and a line of credit from Credit Suisse.

However, consumer lending proved to be a challenging and capital-intensive industry to break into, especially with Deserve assuming the financial risk. In 2018, Deserve shifted its focus and began helping other companies launch credit cards, starting with Sallie Mae. This pivot allowed Deserve to offer a range of services, including risk assessment, transaction processing, customer service, and dispute resolution. Despite this shift, Deserve continued to maintain its original consumer card business and generate revenue from fees and interest.

In 2020, Deserve powered a credit card for Vertical Finance, a fintech startup that was later acquired. The following year, it secured customers such as the University of Notre Dame. However, despite its successes, Deserve faced challenges when its largest customer, BlockFi, went bankrupt. Additionally, as interest rates rose and the startup funding market tightened, Deserve encountered difficulties as its other fintech customers struggled to survive. Despite these challenges, Deserve currently serves 15 customers, including fintech companies and banks.

The competition in the tech-enabled credit card issuing industry has intensified in recent years. With the rise of companies like Marqeta, which announced its acquisition of Power Finance, the market has become increasingly competitive. This landscape, combined with the challenges Deserve has faced, highlights the need for the company to adapt and find new avenues for growth.

In conclusion, Deserve, a Silicon Valley startup specializing in credit card management, is navigating challenges in the current business and funding environment. Despite rumors of a potential sale, Deserve remains focused on strategic partnerships and growth opportunities. With a strong investor backing and a history of serving both fintech companies and banks, Deserve is poised to overcome its obstacles and continue its journey towards profitability and success in the industry.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600d053afe6bed0f9b925c9/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 11:57:06,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-household-robots-common.html,Engineering household robots to have a little common sense,"Robots are becoming increasingly capable of performing complex household tasks, from cleaning spills to serving food. These robots often learn through imitation, copying human motions that guide them through the desired actions. However, robots lack the ability to handle unexpected situations or disruptions unless explicitly programmed to do so. MIT engineers have developed a method to give robots a sense of common sense when faced with deviations from their trained paths. This approach connects robot motion data with large language models, allowing robots to parse tasks into subtasks and adjust their actions to overcome disruptions without starting the entire task from scratch.

Imitation learning is a popular method for training household robots. However, blindly mimicking human motion trajectories can lead to accumulated errors that ultimately derail the execution. With the new method developed by the MIT engineers, robots can self-correct execution errors and improve overall task success. The researchers will present their approach at the International Conference on Learning Representations in May.

To illustrate their approach, the researchers used the example of scooping marbles from one bowl and pouring them into another. Traditionally, engineers would move a robot through the motions of scooping and pouring in one continuous trajectory. However, the team realized that tasks like these involve a sequence of subtasks. For example, the robot must first reach into the bowl, then scoop up the marbles, and finally move to the empty bowl. If a robot makes a mistake during any of these subtasks, it would typically have to start the entire task from the beginning. This level of planning and recovery is time-consuming and tedious.

Instead, the researchers found that some of this work can be automated using large language models (LLMs). LLMs are deep learning models that process extensive libraries of text to establish connections between words, sentences, and paragraphs. By prompting an LLM, it can generate a logical list of subtasks involved in a given task. For instance, if asked to list the actions involved in scooping marbles, an LLM might produce a sequence of verbs like ""reach,"" ""scoop,"" ""transport,"" and ""pour."" These subtasks can then be used to guide the robot's actions and enable self-correction.

To connect the LLM's language labels with the robot's physical position or state, the team developed an algorithm for grounding. Grounding involves mapping the robot's physical coordinates or an image of its state to the natural language labels provided by the LLM. This algorithm allows the robot to automatically determine its current stage in a task and replan or recover on its own.

The researchers' new approach opens up possibilities for robots to adapt and handle unexpected situations without explicit programming for every potential failure. By leveraging the knowledge of large language models, robots can improve their ability to perform complex tasks and increase their overall success rate. This research contributes to advancing the field of robotics and brings us closer to having robots that can navigate real-world environments with more autonomy and intelligence.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/engineering-household.jpg,2024-03-25 09:48:20,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-large-language-simple-mechanism-knowledge.html,Large language models use a surprisingly simple mechanism to retrieve some stored knowledge,"Large language models (LLMs), like the popular ChatGPT chatbot, are incredibly complex and widely used in various fields. However, scientists still have limited understanding of how these models actually work. To gain better insight, researchers from MIT and other institutions have conducted a study on the mechanisms behind LLMs' retrieval of stored knowledge.

Surprisingly, the study revealed that LLMs often employ a simple linear function to decode and retrieve stored facts. Linear functions, which involve only two variables and no exponents, capture the direct relationship between the variables. The researchers discovered that the model uses the same decoding function for similar types of facts.

By identifying linear functions for different facts, researchers can probe the model to explore its knowledge on new subjects and determine where that knowledge is stored within the model. Using a technique they developed to estimate these simple functions, the researchers found that even when a model provides incorrect answers, it often retains the correct information. This approach could potentially help identify and rectify falsehoods within the model, reducing the likelihood of incorrect or nonsensical responses.

Evan Hernandez, an electrical engineering and computer science graduate student at MIT and co-lead author of the study, emphasized that while LLMs are complex and difficult to understand, there are instances where simple mechanisms operate within them. Hernandez collaborated with co-lead author Arnab Sharma, a computer science graduate student at Northeastern University, and other researchers from MIT, Harvard University, and the Israeli Institute of Technology. The findings will be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024) in Vienna.

Most large language models, such as transformer models, function as neural networks. These networks consist of billions of interconnected nodes or neurons organized into multiple layers for data processing and encoding.

The knowledge stored in a transformer model can be represented as relations connecting subjects and objects. For example, the relation ""Miles Davis plays the trumpet"" connects the subject (Miles Davis) to the object (trumpet). As the transformer model accumulates more knowledge, it stores additional facts about a particular subject across multiple layers. When a user inquires about a specific subject, the model must extract the most relevant fact to provide an accurate response.

To understand this mechanism, the researchers conducted a series of experiments on LLMs. They discovered that despite their complexity, these models decode relational information using simple linear functions. Each function is specific to the type of fact being retrieved. For example, the model uses one decoding function to output the instrument a person plays and a different function to output the state where a person was born.

The researchers developed a method to estimate these simple functions and computed functions for 47 different relations, such as ""capital city of a country"" and ""lead singer of a band."" Although there are countless possible relations, the researchers focused on this subset as they are representative of the facts that can be expressed in this manner.

To test the functions, the researchers altered the subject to determine if the correct object information could still be retrieved. The results demonstrated that the linear functions effectively recovered the relevant facts.

This study sheds light on the inner workings of LLMs and provides valuable insights into how these models retrieve and decode information. By understanding the mechanisms behind their knowledge storage and retrieval, researchers can potentially enhance the accuracy and reliability of large language models.

In conclusion, large language models, despite their complexity, often employ simple linear functions to recover and decode stored facts. This study contributes to a better understanding of LLMs and opens up possibilities for improving their performance and reducing the occurrence of incorrect or nonsensical responses.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/large-language-models-2.jpg,2024-03-25 09:34:06,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/25/in-photos-worm-moon-lunar-eclipse-sets-up-total-solar-eclipse/,In Photos: ‘Worm Moon Lunar Eclipse’ Sets Up Total Solar Eclipse,"March’s full moon, known as the ""Worm Moon,"" made an appearance on Sunday night and continued into Monday with a partial eclipse visible in certain parts of the world. This lunar event sets the stage for a complete solar eclipse in North America during the next new moon on April 8.

The third full moon of 2024 and the first of spring in the northern hemisphere was visible worldwide, although the partial lunar eclipse could only be observed from the night side of the planet at the appropriate time. This included North and South America, Europe, East Asia, Australia, and New Zealand.

During the eclipse, the Earth partially blocked the sun from the moon's perspective. This celestial phenomenon occurs exclusively during a full moon when the moon enters the Earth's shadow, a position it can only achieve when it is on the opposite side of the Earth from the sun.

On Monday morning, a penumbral lunar eclipse took place. Earth has two distinct shadows in space: the dark umbra and the fuzzier outer penumbra. During this eclipse, the moon only entered the penumbra, and its journey through this shadow lasted precisely 4 hours and 39 minutes.

As the Earth's shadow moved across the lunar surface, the sunlight reaching the moon diminished, creating a dimmer effect. This differs from a ""Blood Moon,"" where the moon passes through the umbra, and the only sunlight that reaches the lunar surface is refracted by the Earth's atmosphere, resulting in a reddish hue.

Throughout this penumbral lunar eclipse, the moon appeared against the backdrop of the constellation Virgo and was surrounded by its brightest star, Spica, on its lower left. The upper right side featured Antares, the brightest star in the Scorpius constellation. Over the next two nights, the moon will appear much closer to Spica.

As with all full moons, the ""Worm Moon"" was visible throughout the night, rising in the east at sunset and setting in the west at sunrise. This particular full moon earned its name due to the emergence of beetle larvae from the thawing bark of trees during the spring, according to the Almanac.

The upcoming new moon on April 8 will be a ""supermoon,"" appearing larger than usual as it moves across the sun, resulting in a partial solar eclipse visible in North America. The total solar eclipse on April 8 will last up to 4 minutes and 26 seconds but can only be observed within a 115-mile wide path known as the totality.

This path will stretch from the Pacific coast of northwestern Mexico to Atlantic Canada, passing through 15 U.S. states: Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. Outside of this path, people will only witness a partial solar eclipse.

It is rare for a total solar eclipse to occur, happening on average once every 366 years. However, North America is fortunate enough to experience two total solar eclipses within a span of just seven years, with the previous one occurring on August 21, 2017.

Following the ""Worm Moon"" and the total solar eclipse, the next full moon will be the ""Pink Moon"" on April 23 at 23:48 UTC/7:48 p.m. EDT. This will mark the fourth full moon of 2024.

We hope you have a wonderful time observing these celestial events with clear skies and warm eyes.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6601aa9bc397763ceaf0c79a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1566,881,x217,y217,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 12:57:41,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/uk-government-electoral-breach-voter-data-china/,UK blames China for massive breach of voter data,"The U.K. government has officially accused China of being responsible for a cyberattack in 2021 that resulted in the compromise of millions of U.K. voters' personal information. Oliver Dowden, the U.K. deputy prime minister, made this statement during a parliamentary session on Monday. He emphasized that the government will take decisive action against the Chinese government whenever it threatens the interests of the United Kingdom. This marks the first time that the U.K. has attributed the breach to China since it was initially disclosed in 2023.

The cyberattack targeted the Electoral Commission, which maintains records of eligible U.K. voters. Hackers managed to obtain the names and addresses of an estimated 40 million U.K. citizens, including those who were registered to vote between 2014 and 2022, as well as overseas voters. The breach began as early as 2021 but remained undetected until a year later.

The U.K. National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) stated that it is highly likely that the Chinese hackers accessed and extracted emails and data from the electoral register during the attack. The NCSC further warned that Chinese intelligence could potentially use this data for large-scale espionage and repressive actions against dissidents and critics in the U.K.

In a separate incident, a China-backed hacking group attempted to breach the email accounts of U.K. lawmakers in 2021. Fortunately, parliamentary authorities were able to mitigate the attacks before any email accounts were compromised. The NCSC attributed these attempted email hacks to a Chinese hacker group known as APT31, which has a history of targeting the online accounts of foreign government officials.

The U.K. government did not disclose the specific lawmakers whose email accounts were targeted, but the NCSC stated that most of the affected lawmakers have been vocal in denouncing China's malicious activities. The Chinese Embassy in the U.K. denied these allegations and claimed that China does not support or condone hacker attacks, although it did mention that China will resort to lawful methods to counter cyberattacks.

Paul Chichester, the director of operations at the NCSC, condemned the cyber actors involved in these attacks and emphasized that targeting the democratic system is unacceptable. He asserted that the NCSC will continue to expose and confront cyber actors who pose a threat to the fundamental institutions and values of society.

In a related development, the Biden administration also accused several Chinese hackers of being involved in APT31's attempts to target U.S.-based companies. Google security researchers had previously linked APT31 to the targeting of email accounts belonging to the presidential campaigns of both Donald Trump and Joe Biden in 2020.

Recently, a leaked set of documents from Chinese government contractor I-Soon revealed the contractor's methods of targeting and hacking other governments at the behest of Chinese authorities.

These incidents reflect a concerning pattern of behavior from China-affiliated actors, not only against the U.K. but also globally. It highlights the urgent need for governments and organizations to prioritize cybersecurity and take proactive measures to protect their systems and sensitive information from malicious actors.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/uk-polling-booth-elections-cyberattack.jpg?resize=1200,777",2024-03-25 15:50:23,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/webroot/2024/03/25/7-cyber-safety-tips-to-outsmart-scammers/,7 Cyber Safety Tips To Outsmart Scammers,"Welcome to the wild west of the digital world, where cyber scammers are lurking around every corner. Cybercrime is not just a plotline in Hollywood movies; it is a real threat that targets people of all ages. From kids who are just starting out online to experienced adults and wise grandparents, no one is immune. In fact, cybercrime is on the rise faster than your Wi-Fi connection during peak hours. So, buckle up and get ready to navigate the seven seas of cyber safety.

Before we dive into the tips for staying safe online, let's arm ourselves with the ultimate weapon: knowledge. Scams are the digital equivalent of snake oil salespeople peddling miracle cures. They come in all shapes and sizes, lurking in the dark corners of the internet. The golden rule of scam detection is skepticism. Whether it's a promise of untold riches, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, or a free Caribbean cruise courtesy of a Nigerian prince, approach with caution and a healthy dose of skepticism.

Now, let's take a quick tour through the common types of cyber scams:

1. Phishing scams: Ah, phishing scams, the bane of our digital existence. These sneaky scams involve fake emails posing as messages from familiar faces or reputable companies. They'll try to sweet-talk you into clicking on suspicious links or divulging sensitive information like passwords or credit card details. Remember: real companies don't ask for your personal data via email.

2. Sweepstakes and awards scams: Congratulations! You've just won a brand new car, a tropical vacation, and a lifetime supply of unicorn-shaped cookies. All you need to do is pay a small processing fee. Sound too good to be true? That's because it is! These scams offer you instant wealth but are really just clever ruses to empty your wallet faster than you can say ""jackpot.""

3. Investment scams: Picture this: a golden opportunity to double your money with zero risk. Investment scams lure unsuspecting victims with the promise of sky-high profits. Don't let these offers cloud your judgment. Always do your due diligence before investing your hard-earned cash.

4. Lawsuit or tax scams: Lawsuit and tax scams thrive on instilling fear and panic, claiming you owe urgent payments. When in doubt, verify the legitimacy of any claims before reaching for your wallet.

5. Romance scams: Romance scams prey on the trusting hearts of hopeful romantics, weaving elaborate tales of love and devotion before swooping in for the financial kill. Remember: anyone who asks for money online is more likely to break your heart than mend it.

6. Tech support scams: These imposters offer remote assistance to fix nonexistent problems with your laptop or devices while gaining access to your sensitive data. Remember: legitimate tech support doesn't come knocking unsolicited. If in doubt, just delete the email and seek help from trusted sources.

Armed with this knowledge, you are ready to navigate the digital minefield with confidence. You can also be a good internet citizen by forwarding these scams to the U.S. government's Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) at phishing-report@us-cert.gov.

Now, let's move on to the tips for staying safe online. Here are seven essential practices to protect yourself from cyber threats:

1. Use strong passwords: Your password is the digital key to your castle, so make sure it's not something as flimsy as '123456' or 'password.' Get creative! Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters like a mad scientist concocting a secret potion. And don't reuse passwords across multiple accounts unless you want to throw a welcome party for cybercriminals.

2. Enable two-factor authentication: Adding an extra layer of security to your accounts is always a good idea. Two-factor authentication requires you to provide a second piece of identification, such as a fingerprint or a one-time verification code, in addition to your password. This makes it much harder for hackers to gain access to your accounts.

3. Keep your devices updated: Software updates may seem like a nuisance, but they are crucial for keeping your devices safe from vulnerabilities. These updates often contain security patches that fix known issues and protect you from the latest threats. So, don't ignore those update notifications.

4. Be cautious with public Wi-Fi: Public Wi-Fi networks can be a breeding ground for cybercriminals. Avoid accessing sensitive information, such as online banking or shopping, while connected to public Wi-Fi. If you must use it, consider using a virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt your data and protect your privacy.

5. Think before you click: Links can be deceiving, so think twice before clicking on them. Hover your mouse over the link to see the actual URL before clicking. If it looks suspicious or unfamiliar, don't take the risk. It's better to be safe than sorry.

6. Be mindful of what you share online: Social media is a treasure trove of personal information, and cybercriminals love it. Be cautious about what you share online, especially when it comes to personal details like your address, phone number, or even your vacation plans. Remember, once it's out there, you can't take it back.

7. Educate yourself and your loved ones: Knowledge is power when it comes to staying safe online. Stay informed about the latest scams and educate yourself on how to recognize and avoid them. Share this knowledge with your friends and family, especially the elderly and children who may be more vulnerable to cyber threats.

By following these tips, you can navigate the digital world with confidence and protect yourself from cyber scams. Remember, cybercrime is real, but with the right knowledge and precautions, you can stay one step ahead of the scammers. Stay safe out there!",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ea0ea426a7cb96ff0f5cde/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 11:48:40,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/gostudent-tutoring-profitability/,"GoStudent, the online learning platform, says it's now profitable","GoStudent, the popular online tutoring marketplace based in Vienna, Austria, has achieved profitability, making it one of the few Austrian startups to gain recognition on the international tech scene. CEO Felix Ohswald announced that the company is not only EBITDA profitable but also has positive operating cash flow. However, GoStudent faced challenges along the way. During the online learning boom, the market crashed, causing a decline in customer demand and significant losses for the company. As a result, GoStudent underwent multiple rounds of layoffs and cost-cutting measures.

Ohswald described the company's growth as ""crazy hyperscaling"" from 2019 to 2022, with revenue exceeding €100 million. However, the company also experienced a cash burn of over €150 million in 2022 alone. Realizing the need for change, GoStudent reduced its burn rate by 70% in 2023 but still struggled to achieve profitability. Despite raising significant funding, the company had to make tough decisions and undergo restructuring to continue growing.

While the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated the digital transformation in education, benefiting edtech companies like GoStudent, the company still needed to address its cash burn issue. It made various cuts, including reducing expenses on parties and acquisitions, as well as refraining from expanding into new markets where online tutoring was not established or where price competition was too high.

GoStudent shifted its focus to Europe and implemented an organic growth strategy outside of German-speaking countries. The company also hired a new chief marketing officer to prioritize bottom-line growth over top-line growth. GoStudent's goal is to become the leading global school, unlocking the potential of every student through personalized tutoring. To achieve this, the company acquired Studienkreis, a physical learning center with 1,000 locations primarily in Germany, allowing GoStudent to expand its hybrid learning offerings.

Ohswald emphasized the importance of a hybrid education model, combining technology with physical learning centers. He believes that personalized tutoring is key to each student's success, regardless of their location. GoStudent's tutors, primarily university students, connect well with pupils and provide valuable educational support.

In conclusion, GoStudent's journey to profitability has been challenging but ultimately successful. The company has adapted to market changes, made strategic cuts, and shifted its focus to Europe. With its acquisition of Studienkreis, GoStudent is poised to further its mission of providing personalized tutoring and unlocking the potential of every student.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Founders-of-GoStudent-Gregor-Muller-I-Felix-Ohswald-2.jpg?w=1024,2024-03-25 11:00:36,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/spotify-courses-learning/,Spotify tests video courses to teach everything from music production to Excel,"Spotify, known for its music streaming and podcast entertainment, is now venturing into the world of e-learning. The company is testing the waters with an online education offering in the UK, partnering with third parties like the BBC and Skillshare to provide freemium video courses. While at least two lessons will be free, the total cost of a course will range from £20 to £80 on average. This pricing structure applies to both basic and premium users, for now.

The courses will be accessible on both Spotify's website and mobile app, residing in the home and browse tabs under a new section called ""Courses"". The content aims to offer a blend of YouTube, Master Class, and LinkedIn Learning, covering a wide range of subjects from music production to Excel tutorials. Additionally, there will be lessons on how to create online learning materials, catering to musicians and others interested in becoming ""education creators"".

While the online learning market is already saturated with various platforms, Spotify's focus is on one-directional, on-demand video content. Although some courses may include supplementary material, such as extra documents, there won't be tests or other interactive elements at this stage. Spotify's product director for the education business, Mohit Jitani, did not comment on whether the company plans to introduce gamification or interaction in the future.

Spotify has partnered with Skillshare, PLAYvirtuoso, BBC Maestro, and Thinkific as its initial course providers. The company plans to curate its course offerings based on user preferences and interests. Jitani mentioned that Spotify will explore what people are already listening to and searching for on the platform to guide its curation process. The topics covered in the courses will be diverse, and Spotify aims to identify popular segments and provide the best content in those areas.

The videos featured in the courses are owned by third-party publishers who license them to Spotify. However, the videos will be hosted and sold directly on Spotify's platform. Revenue from course sales will be shared between the creators, publishers, and Spotify, with content partners handling payment distribution to creators. The revenue split details have not been disclosed, nor is it clear if Spotify will offer any discounts or benefits to premium subscribers.

Spotify's move into the education space is part of its strategy to diversify its business and improve profitability. The company has experienced financial ups and downs, including recent quarterly net losses of $81 million. However, Spotify sees potential in the UK market due to its large user base and high engagement levels.

The decision to enter the education sector aligns with Spotify's growing podcast business. The company has noticed a strong correlation between popular podcasts and educational content on its platform. Around 50% of Spotify Premium subscribers have listened to education or self-help themed podcasts, indicating a demand for educational content. Spotify aims to leverage its recommendation algorithm to cross-promote podcasts and courses, hoping that one will drive interest and sales for the other.

In addition to its podcast endeavors, Spotify has been developing tools for creators to manage and grow their content. The expansion into e-learning aligns with this objective, providing creators with a new avenue to share their expertise and monetize their skills.

While Spotify's foray into e-learning may seem unexpected, it combines the company's existing strengths in music streaming and podcasting with the growing demand for educational content. By offering curated courses and leveraging its user data, Spotify hopes to capture a share of the online learning market and further diversify its business.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Courses-on-Spotify-PR-Image-6-2.png?resize=1200,683",2024-03-25 08:59:18,Innovation,Innovation
