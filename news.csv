This is because cars and trucks contribute nearly 30% of greenhouse gas emissions. In response, the Biden Administration has introduced new goals to significantly reduce automotive CO2 emissions. These goals aim to have more than 56% of new passenger vehicle sales be electric by 2032, a seven-fold increase from their current market share. While some environmentalists argue that the revised rules are not stringent enough, automakers see them as a roadmap for a clean transportation revolution.

In 2023, U.S. electric vehicle (EV) sales reached a record 1.2 million, representing just under 8% of new vehicles sold. However, the pace of EV sales has slowed in 2024 due to higher prices compared to gasoline models, high interest rates, and a lack of public charging infrastructure. Despite this, analysts predict that increased domestic sourcing of battery materials like lithium and graphite, as well as a wider range of EV models, including more affordable options, throughout this decade will make both battery-only and plug-in hybrid vehicles increasingly attractive to consumers.

Nevertheless, there are potential obstacles to the widespread adoption of EVs. Republicans generally oppose efforts to transition away from gasoline-powered automobiles. Additionally, if Donald Trump were to win a second presidential term, his disapproval of EVs and previous rollback of Obama-era auto pollution rules could undermine the new regulations. However, manufacturers appreciate that the new rules offer flexibility in meeting annual targets through various technologies, including the sale of hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and battery-only models. Furthermore, as significant investments pour into new battery and materials plants situated primarily in conservative states, creating tens of thousands of jobs, there may be less support for sticking with polluting gas-guzzlers.

The Need for Enhanced Electric Grid Capacity

As the demand for electricity continues to rise in the United States, driven by factors such as increased domestic manufacturing, electric vehicle sales, and the growing number of power-hungry data centers for online activities, there is a pressing need to boost the capacity of the electric grid. Norwegian tech startup Heimdall Power claims that its sensors and software can increase the capacity of existing transmission lines by up to 40%. To substantiate this claim, the Oslo-based company recently secured its largest deal in the U.S. to date. It will supply dozens of its Neuron sensors, also known as ""magic balls,"" to Minnesota's Great River Energy, a cooperative of 27 power companies serving 1.7 million people and businesses across Minnesota, North Dakota, and Wisconsin. A pilot project using Heimdall's technology on a few of Great River's lines resulted in a 43% increase in capacity. Heimdall's CEO, Jørgen Festervoll, compares the temperature of a power line to a speed limit, stating that without the company's software and sensors, it's like driving without a speedometer.

The Challenges of Amazon's Plastic Waste

One of the prominent issues related to sustainability and waste management is the recycling of Amazon's plastic packaging. A report by CalPIRG tracked 93 bundles of Amazon plastic waste dropped off at store bins in 10 states and found that only four of those bundles made it to recycling centers. This highlights the difficulty of recycling plastic, particularly plastic film used for bubble wrap, which is nearly impossible to recycle. The current system for recycling plastic packaging is not very effective.

The decision to conduct the report was driven by the observation of the vast amount of Amazon shipments received by people and the subsequent accumulation of packaging materials such as plastic mailers, bags, and air pillows. The report aimed to investigate what happens to these materials. While cardboard boxes can be recycled curbside, the plastic blue-and-white envelopes with the recycling logo require individuals to find specific drop-off locations. Many people are unaware of this requirement and mistakenly place the plastic packaging in their home recycling bins, leading to contamination in local recycling centers.

A better solution would be for Amazon to stop using plastic packaging altogether. In Europe, Amazon has committed to using paper packaging and cardboard boxes. This shift to more sustainable packaging materials would significantly reduce the environmental impact of Amazon's operations.

Conclusion

Transitioning the U.S. vehicle fleet to electric power is a crucial step in addressing climate change and reducing carbon dioxide emissions. The Biden Administration's new goals to increase the market share of electric vehicles are a significant milestone in this effort. While challenges remain, such as political opposition and the need for improved infrastructure, advancements in battery technology and a broader range of affordable electric vehicle models are expected to drive consumer adoption.

In parallel, enhancing the capacity of the electric grid is essential to meet rising electricity demand. Companies like Heimdall Power are developing innovative solutions, such as sensors and software, to increase transmission line capacity. These advancements can help support the growth of renewable energy sources and the electrification of various sectors, including transportation.

Furthermore, addressing the issue of plastic waste, particularly in the context of e-commerce giants like Amazon, is crucial for a more sustainable future. Improving recycling systems and transitioning to more environmentally friendly packaging materials can significantly reduce the environmental impact of online retail.

Overall, the pursuit of cleaner transportation, increased grid capacity, and sustainable waste management are all critical components of the ongoing efforts to combat climate change and build a more sustainable future.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fba1ea7a12ebb47aaa74bb/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2312,1300,x661,y0,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 06:30:00,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/03/25/how-organizations-can-use-cx-ai-to-connect-with-their-consumers/,How Organizations Can Use CX AI To Connect With Their Consumers,"organizations, personalization is a crucial aspect of connecting with consumers. However, finding the right balance can be challenging. On one hand, organizations risk annoying consumers if they provide irrelevant information. On the other hand, if they personalize too much, consumers may become suspicious about the extent of the organization's knowledge about them. In today's technological era, consumers have come to expect a higher level of personalization and are willing to share more information with organizations as long as they receive something valuable in return. It is up to organizations to anticipate consumers' needs and provide tailored information at the right time to keep their consumers satisfied. This may seem like predicting the future, but with the help of CX AI, it is not as difficult as it sounds.

Let's delve deeper into this concept. As an avid cyclist, I appreciate it when businesses understand my preferences and provide me with the latest cycling products to enhance my experience. For instance, when I log in to my Amazon account, I receive a list of recommended products that I may not have considered otherwise. I willingly share my information because I value this personalized content. Similarly, I rate restaurants on various apps to help them understand my preferences and make suitable recommendations for other dining options. Personalization extends beyond product recommendations; it also involves tailoring how organizations interact with individual consumers. For example, if I reach out to an organization through WhatsApp, they can recognize my preferred mode of communication and use it for future interactions.

CX AI plays a significant role in facilitating personalization for organizations. By consolidating all customer interactions into one platform, organizations gain a comprehensive view of each individual consumer. This knowledge allows them to tailor their interactions accordingly. Here are some ways in which organizations can hyper-personalize customer interactions:

1. Interaction-centric cloud CX platform: Organizations should have a centralized location to store all customer interaction history. This acts as a gold mine for CX leaders, providing valuable insights into consumers' preferences and eliminating the need for consumers to repeat information. CX AI learns from this data to offer relevant and specific recommendations for excellent customer experience.

2. AI routing: Organizations can use AI to understand consumers' personalities and communication preferences. By matching consumers with the best agent or self-service resource, organizations can provide personalized interactions. Whether a consumer prefers a warm, friendly conversation or a quick problem-solving approach, AI ensures the right resource is available.

3. AI-powered sales-effectiveness models: AI can recommend products or services based on customer preferences, thereby increasing sales. For example, travel companies can suggest specific destinations based on whether a consumer prefers the beach or the mountains.

4. AI-powered customer satisfaction models: Real-time sentiment analysis enables organizations to monitor customer satisfaction during interactions. AI can then coach agents on how to improve the situation. For instance, if a customer becomes upset, AI can suggest options for the agent to turn the call around, such as building rapport or demonstrating ownership.

5. Intelligent bots: Generative AI has enhanced the capabilities of bots, enabling them to provide high-level service. With the addition of semantics, bots can now communicate like human agents. It is becoming increasingly difficult for consumers to differentiate between a bot and a human agent.

Choosing the right technology is imperative when implementing CX AI. Organizations must ensure that the AI is domain-specific and aligned with their brand language. This guarantees that the insights and knowledge delivered by AI are relevant, accurate, and appropriate. Failure to implement the right AI can damage a brand's reputation and, subsequently, consumer loyalty.

In conclusion, CX AI enables organizations to establish deeper connections with their consumers. Personalization is vital in today's consumer landscape, and organizations must find the right balance to deliver tailored experiences. By leveraging CX AI, organizations can anticipate consumer needs, make informed recommendations, and create a positive customer experience. Remember, personalization is not about invading privacy; it's about providing value and enhancing the overall customer journey.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fdbcfd2050ee8b6bcdbfc2/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 06:45:00,Innovation,Innovation

This is especially true for enterprises and government organizations that rely on connecting their employees to crucial enterprise applications. The rise of remote working in recent years has led to a significant increase in the shipment rate for cellular-embedded laptops, with numbers expected to continue to rise in the coming years. This push for ""always connected"" PCs is driven by the desire to improve employee productivity and take advantage of new capabilities offered by AI and cloud computing.

However, this shift towards always-on devices comes with its own set of challenges for CIOs. They must navigate the costs and security implications of managing global enterprise mobile networks. In this article, we will explore the current methods used to establish secure mobile networks for employee mobility and examine alternative strategies that organizations can consider when deploying global mobile connectivity.

One popular method for ensuring secure remote access for employees is through the use of VPNs (Virtual Private Networks). VPNs provide a secure connection regardless of location, allowing employees to access sensitive data without risking interception or unauthorized access. This makes VPNs a popular choice for businesses of all sizes, offering a cost-effective alternative to other options like leased lines or hardware-based encryption devices. VPNs enable enterprises to maintain data integrity, regulatory compliance, and connectivity requirements in today's remote and digital landscape.

However, deploying VPN clients on mobile devices via mobile device management (MDM) can present its own challenges. While VPNs encrypt data during transmission, they are not immune to security flaws and potential cyber threats. Managing VPN clients individually can be cumbersome and lead to inconsistent security policies, putting organizations at risk of breaches. Scaling VPN infrastructure globally can also result in latency and performance issues, especially for bandwidth-intensive applications, impacting the user experience.

Another challenge faced by CIOs of multinational companies is managing mobile data connectivity offered by different mobile operators in each country. This creates integration and management hurdles due to varying cost structures and capabilities. It can hinder organizations from having full control over their data costs, despite the productivity benefits of a cellular-first strategy for their workforce.

To address these challenges, there are several strategies available for secure and cost-efficient mobile network integration. One option is to securely integrate with the core infrastructure of mobile network operators by requesting private Access Point Names (APNs) and dedicated lines between data centers. This approach isolates the device from any public network, making it particularly popular for deployments within a single country. However, it can become complex and resource-intensive when connecting to a large network of mobile operators and distributed corporate applications. The associated costs can also escalate, making it less attractive for large-scale deployments.

For CIOs looking to leverage public mobile networks while maintaining security comparable to private networks and achieving cost efficiency, there are other strategies to consider. One tactic is to integrate post-quantum cryptography, which enhances network security by recognizing the potential vulnerability of traditional cryptographic methods to advancements in quantum computing. This proactive measure ensures resilience against future threats, strengthening the network against unauthorized access and data breaches. While these encryption solutions have traditionally been prevalent in the defense and military sectors, they are now expanding into enterprise versions, offering enhanced security measures for businesses operating in dynamic digital environments.

Another innovative solution is the transition to a software-defined networking (SDN) client. By utilizing SDN, network policies can be dynamically adjusted to meet the needs of the organization. This flexibility allows for more efficient network management and can improve security by implementing policies based on real-time data and threat intelligence.

In conclusion, the need for secure and efficient mobile connectivity is paramount in today's digital landscape. CIOs must navigate the challenges of managing global enterprise mobile networks while ensuring cost efficiency and maintaining security. By considering alternative strategies such as integrating post-quantum cryptography and transitioning to SDN clients, organizations can enhance their mobile network integration and create a more secure and productive environment for their employees.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fdbad69183dd117b0e8a15/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 06:30:00,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/03/25/navigating-fully-homomorphic-encryption-for-data-protection/,Navigating Fully Homomorphic Encryption For Data Protection,"Data breaches have become a common occurrence in today's digital landscape. With the increasing value of data, it is crucial for organizations to prioritize robust data security solutions. Traditional protection methods have proven to be inadequate in the face of growing attack rates and evolving cybercrime techniques. However, there is renewed hope in the form of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), a technology that allows computations on encrypted data without the need for decryption.

Derived from the Greek words ""homos"" meaning same, and ""morphe"" meaning shape or form, FHE enables data to be processed while still in its encrypted state. This means that data remains protected throughout its entire life cycle, reducing the attack surface and fundamentally changing how organizations approach data security. FHE achieves this through encryption and key generation, specialized homomorphic operations, noise management, and secret sharing and bootstrapping.

One of the key advantages of FHE is secure data sharing. With this cryptographic technique, multiple parties can collaborate on sensitive data without compromising security. They can perform queries or computations on shared encrypted data without revealing the underlying information. This enables secure collaboration and data-driven decision-making without the risk of exposing sensitive data.

Another advantage of FHE is its ability to enable advanced data analytics. With FHE, organizations can extract actionable insights from persistently encrypted data. This means that they can harness the utility of their data while remaining fully secure and compliant with data protection regulations. FHE opens up new possibilities for data-driven innovation without sacrificing security.

FHE also incorporates zero-knowledge proofs, which add an additional layer of security to the process. Zero-knowledge proofs ensure that the party performing computations does not gain any knowledge about the input data other than the output computation. This strengthens the security of FHE and enhances privacy protection.

However, the widespread adoption of FHE comes with its own set of challenges. FHE has significant computational demands, leading to performance overhead in time-sensitive environments. The complexity of FHE systems also requires specialized skills for effective implementation. Additionally, while FHE offers strong encryption, its security is not immune to advancements in quantum computing, which could pose future risks to its cryptographic assurances.

To address these challenges, leaders should prioritize knowledge and training within their teams. Cultivating expertise in FHE can demystify complexities and streamline implementation. Incremental adoption allows for assessing the impact of FHE and adjusting strategies accordingly. Staying updated on quantum computing developments is crucial to ensure preparedness for evolving security landscapes. Engaging diverse organizational roles in FHE discussions aligns implementation with business objectives and regulatory compliance. Finally, building connections with academia and industry peers can offer fresh perspectives and insights into effective FHE applications and security practices.

In conclusion, fully homomorphic encryption represents a groundbreaking shift in data security. It enables secure data utilization, secure collaboration, and advanced data analytics while preserving privacy and compliance. While there are challenges to overcome, leaders who embrace FHE and navigate these challenges strategically can unlock its full potential for their organizations.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/61095ac215869a022481acb3/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 06:15:00,Innovation,Innovation

https://venturebeat.com/ai/companies-are-about-to-waste-billions-on-ai-heres-how-not-to-become-one-of-them/,Companies are about to waste billions on AI - here's how not to become one of them,"Join us on March 27 in Boston for an exclusive networking event focused on data integrity. This event is designed for Gen AI enterprise leaders who are interested in gaining insights and engaging in conversations surrounding this important topic. Request an invite to secure your spot!

When it comes to new technologies, particularly during the hype cycle phase, caution often takes a backseat. VCs, for instance, are under pressure to invest their raised capital and fear missing out on the next big thing. This same dynamic is mirrored within companies, where anything remotely associated with AI is seen as the technology of the moment and an opportunity not to be missed.

However, this enthusiasm for AI can lead to wasted investments. Billions of dollars will likely be squandered on AI projects over the next decade. While this may sound contradictory, it's important to remember that every technological wave comes with excitement, even before its true transformative potential is fully understood. For example, search, social, and mobile have had a significant and lasting impact, while virtual reality and crypto have been more limited in their reach.

Despite this, it's undeniable that large language models (LLMs) are a game-changing technology. Just look at the rapid adoption of ChatGPT, which has already reached 100 million users. Nearly every enterprise company is exploring ways to leverage LLMs and AI. So, how can you make informed decisions about where to invest and where you have a real chance of success?

To avoid wasted spend, there are three key factors to consider:

1. Understand the total cost over time: Before saying yes to an AI project, carefully evaluate the cost of the necessary resources, both upfront and ongoing, to sustain that project. Often, the work of a data science team requires significant additional resources from engineering, DevOps, QA, product, and SysOps. Many companies have abandoned projects that were initially promising but lacked the necessary ongoing investment. Saying no to an AI initiative can be difficult, but frequently saying yes can come at the expense of fully funding initiatives that truly deserve support in the long run.

Additionally, it's important to recognize the increasing marginal cost associated with AI. Large models are expensive to train, run, and maintain. Overusing AI without a corresponding increase in value can eat into your margins. Furthermore, scaling back or retracting AI functionality can lead to customer dissatisfaction and damage your reputation, especially during a hype cycle. Just look at the missteps that have affected Google's AI reputation or the early days of IBM's Watson.

2. Ask why no one else can do it: The concept of commoditization is easy to understand in theory but often forgotten in practice. In the tech industry, there are monopolies and commodities. When considering an AI initiative, it's crucial to ask yourself, ""Why us?"" Working on something that will eventually become commoditized is not enjoyable, especially if you lack the scale or cost advantage. Instead, focus on areas where you have a defensive moat, such as preferential data access, proprietary insights, or applications with strong network effects and a head start.

3. Make strategic bets: Sometimes, the best bets are the ones that enhance your existing business. As the BASF commercial famously said, ""We don't make the things you buy, we make the things you buy better."" If applying AI can provide momentum to your current products or services, it's a strategic move worth considering. By focusing on improving your core business, you can leverage AI in a way that creates tangible value and sets you apart from competitors.

In conclusion, while it's easy to get caught up in the AI hype, it's crucial to approach investments in this technology with a clear-eyed perspective. By understanding the total cost over time, questioning why no one else can do it, and making strategic bets, you can avoid wasted spend and position yourself for success in the AI landscape. So, before jumping on the AI bandwagon, take a step back and evaluate the true potential and long-term viability of your investment.",https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/An_AI_sitting_in_a_corner_curled_up_looking_sa-transformed.jpeg?w=1200&strip=all,2024-03-24 18:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/apple-sued-microsofts-ai-ambitions-and-nvidia-surprises/,"Apple sued, Microsoft's AI ambitions and Nvidia's surprises","Welcome to this edition of Week in Review, where we bring you the latest news and updates from the tech world. In this week's edition, we have some major developments in the Apple antitrust lawsuit and Microsoft's AI ambitions. Let's dive right in.

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has joined international regulators in accusing Apple of using monopolistic tactics to lock in iPhone users. Apple, however, claims that the DOJ's actions could undermine what its users love about its phones and ecosystem.

The lawsuit draws parallels between Apple and Microsoft in the 1990s, although there are notable differences between the two companies and their efforts to retain customers. Despite the lawsuit, experts predict that it could take several years for a resolution to be reached.

In other news, Microsoft has acquired the co-founders of Inflection AI, a prominent AI startup. Mustafa Suleyman will now lead Microsoft AI's consumer-facing unit, while Karén Simonyan becomes the EVP and CEO of the same group. Inflection AI had previously raised $1.3 billion, with Microsoft being its biggest investor.

Nvidia's recent GTC developer conference also made waves in the tech world. CEO Jensen Huang surprised attendees with a prediction that artificial general intelligence could be achieved within five years. Additionally, Nvidia unveiled GR00T, a new AI platform for humanoid robots.

Meanwhile, Google and Apple are reportedly in talks to deploy Google's AI model on iPhones. The outcome of these negotiations remains uncertain, but it raises questions about the future of Apple's own AI efforts.

Moving on to hacking and privacy, the Biden administration is leading an international coalition to combat commercial spyware. Interestingly, it was discovered that one of the investors supporting this initiative had previously been involved in the spyware business.

In gaming news, a hack disrupted a $5 million Apex Legends tournament. The hack was carried out to draw attention to an exploit used in the game and to raise awareness among developers.

Glassdoor, the popular job review platform, is facing scrutiny as users report that their real names are being added to their profiles without their consent. The only solution provided to affected users is to delete their accounts entirely.

In funding and IPO news, Reddit's IPO had a strong start, with the stock price jumping 48% on its first day of trading. Astera Labs, a company specializing in connectivity hardware for cloud computing data centers, also had a successful IPO, with its stock closing at a high on its first day.

Lastly, The Browser Company, the startup behind the Arc browser, raised $50 million in funding. The company has a unique approach to replacing PCs with browsers but is still uncertain about its path to monetization.

In our bonus round, we explore the challenges AI faces in spelling correctly and dive into Fisker's financial struggles, which have led to a production pause for the company.

While AI systems like ChatGPT or Gemini are difficult to review, it is crucial to test and evaluate them, considering their impact on various fields.

That wraps up this edition of Week in Review. Stay tuned for more updates in the tech world.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/apple-antitrust-doj-splash.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-23 20:15:37,Innovation,Innovation
