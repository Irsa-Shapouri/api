https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikestubbs/2024/03/24/new-valorant-agent-clove-can-come-back-from-the-dead/,New ‘Valorant’ Agent Clove Can Come Back From The Dead,"Introducing Clove: The New Valorant Agent Bringing Unique Abilities

Valorant Masters Madrid recently showcased the unveiling of Clove, the highly anticipated 25th agent in Valorant. With intriguing abilities that set them apart from the rest, Clove is ready to make their mark in the game. Developed by Riot Games, this new agent has a special skill that allows them to come back from the dead, making them a formidable force on the battlefield.

As a controller, Clove's main focus is to disrupt enemies and provide utility for their team. However, what makes them truly valuable and lethal is their unique ultimate ability. Set to be released as part of the upcoming Valorant patch on March 26, players are eagerly awaiting the chance to experience Clove's power firsthand.

One of Clove's abilities is called Ruse, activated by pressing the E key. This ability allows Clove to create a smoke screen similar to Brimstone's smoke. What sets it apart is the ability to bring up a small window that provides a top-down view of the map area. From there, players can strategically select where to drop the smoke, obstructing the enemy's vision. What makes Ruse even more fascinating is that it can be utilized even after Clove's demise, making them more useful than they may initially appear.

Clove's Q ability, Meddle, is a grenade-like throwable that inflicts decay on any enemy it hits. While it may seem like the least impactful ability among Clove's arsenal, skilled players will find creative ways to utilize it efficiently.

Another ability in Clove's kit is Pick-Me-Up, activated by pressing the C key. This ability bears similarities to Reyna's kit, allowing Clove to absorb the life essence of a slain enemy. By doing so, they gain haste and a temporary health boost. Though not the most exciting ability, it adds an extra layer of versatility to Clove's playstyle.

Finally, we come to Clove's ultimate ability, the highlight of their kit. When Clove dies and their ultimate ability is ready, they can quickly activate it to come back to life for a short period. If they manage to secure a kill or assist during this resurrection period, they will be fully revived, as if they had never died. However, if they fail to secure a kill or assist, they will return to the grave once the resurrection timer expires.

Clove's abilities make it clear that they can still be influential even after being taken down. Whether it's utilizing their ultimate to gain a second chance at life or strategically placing smokes after death, Clove proves to be an excellent entry fragger, with a significantly reduced risk of dying.

Dan Hardison, agent gameplay designer on Valorant, explains the optimal way to play Clove. He emphasizes the importance of taking risks and sacrificing one's life for the greater good. Removing enemy utility from the round by eliminating opponents is key to success with Clove. Unlike other controllers, Clove may have weaker raw execute utility on average. However, their ability to contribute post-death sets them apart. Hardison advises players to fight fearlessly, always willing to trade their life for the squad. Even a 1-for-1 trade is advantageous for Clove if their life is exchanged for that of a non-Clove opponent. Playing Clove requires a fearless and selfless mindset.

In conclusion, Clove brings a fresh and exciting gameplay experience to Valorant. With their ability to disrupt enemies, provide utility, and even come back from the dead, Clove is a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield. The release of Clove on March 26 has Valorant players eagerly anticipating the chance to use their unique abilities and dominate the game. So, gear up, take risks, and embrace the power of Clove in the world of Valorant.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff3fefa4d4cfc35a9fc1fe/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 11:15:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/24/debunked-i-think-ive-seen-a-total-solar-eclipse-before/,Debunked: ‘I Think I’ve Seen A Total Solar Eclipse Before’,"Total Solar Eclipses: A Rare and Unforgettable Celestial Event

Have you ever witnessed a total solar eclipse? If you think you have, chances are you're mistaken. Eclipse chasers often say that those who claim to have seen a total solar eclipse are misremembering. What they actually saw was a partial solar eclipse, a much more common occurrence that happens twice a year in various parts of the world.

So, how can we be sure? Well, those who have truly experienced totality—when the moon completely blocks the sun—never forget it. It's a once-in-a-lifetime event that leaves a lasting impact. The memory of the beautiful twilight-like sky, the silhouette of the moon, and the stunning sight of the sun's spiky white corona shining all around it is cherished forever.

Moreover, witnessing a total solar eclipse requires effort. You need to be in the path of totality, the specific area on Earth where the moon entirely obscures the sun. If you are not within this path, you will only see a partial solar eclipse. So, if you're unsure about whether you've seen a total solar eclipse, eclipse chasers are skeptical.

The ""Great American Eclipse"" of 2017 was a significant event for North America. Twelve U.S. states, from Oregon to South Carolina, experienced totality, with around 12 million people living on the path and another million traveling to witness it. If you were fortunate enough to be in the path of totality, you would remember the breathtaking sight and the magical atmosphere that enveloped you.

If you're still uncertain about whether you've seen a total solar eclipse, there are ways to verify it. If your memory involves solar eclipse glasses or pinhole cameras, it's likely from the 2017 eclipse, which was a partial solar eclipse visible across North America. To confirm, you can use the Solar Eclipses Visibility Database, which provides information on the location and visibility of solar eclipses.

To help you determine whether you've experienced a total solar eclipse, here is a list of all the total solar eclipses that have occurred in North America in the last 70 years. Each eclipse is linked to an interactive map, allowing you to see if you were within the path of totality. If the dates are not listed, it means it was a partial solar eclipse.

Next time you come across someone who believes they've seen a total solar eclipse, ask them when and where it was and what they remember about it. Encourage them to describe the phenomenon of totality. Then, gently reveal to them the upcoming once-in-a-lifetime total eclipse on April 8, 2024. This event will be witnessed by a staggering 42 million people, including 32 million Americans, who already reside in the path of totality.

On April 8, 2024, everyone in North America will see a partial solar eclipse. However, only those within a narrow 115-mile path encompassing parts of Mexico, 15 U.S. states, and Canada will have the privilege of experiencing totality. This path will span five states in Mexico, 15 U.S. states, and six Canadian provinces.

If you're eager to witness this extraordinary event, stay updated with the latest information on the total solar eclipse. Check for new articles each day, covering travel and lodging options, to ensure you make the most of this awe-inspiring phenomenon.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2024/03/24/unveiling-the-journey-of-a-social-media-influencer/,Unveiling The Journey Of A Social Media Influencer,"How did you begin your journey as a social media influencer and how has it impacted your life? Bruce Brackett, CEO at BWB ART, shares his story on Quora.

Bruce admits that he initially overlooked the potential benefits and drawbacks of social media. While he had always maintained a presence on various platforms, he never took it seriously beyond sharing his thoughts and selfies. However, everything changed when he started sharing his personal experiences, inner strength, and hope. His posts became more vulnerable and relatable, resonating with thousands of people. 

Social media is often criticized for its negativity and bullying culture. Recognizing this, Bruce developed a three-step formula before posting anything: 1. Is it helpful? 2. Is it something he wants to contribute to the world? 3. Is it something he himself needs to hear? If a post meets all three criteria, he shares it with his followers. 

Bruce acknowledges that social media has transformed his life for the better by serving as a launching pad for his career. It has provided him with a wealth of knowledge and connections. Fortunately, he has been able to avoid a significant amount of hate or negativity that many influencers experience. He attributes this to his catchphrase, ""Negativity Be Gone,"" which has become a protective shield against negativity. Bruce no longer welcomes or entertains negativity in his life, allowing him to embrace a world filled with positivity. It has truly been a breath of fresh air.

Bruce's journey as a social media influencer has been instrumental in shaping his life. The platform has allowed him to share his story, connect with others, and spread positivity. While social media may have its downsides, Bruce has found a way to navigate through them and focus on the positive impact he can make. He encourages others to do the same and seize the opportunities that social media presents.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/technology/article/what-are-rpg-games/,What Is A Role-Playing Game? RPG Types Explained,"Role-playing games (RPGs) have diverse meanings for different individuals. Some envision RPGs as gatherings around a table, rolling dice, and creating stories with friends. Others associate RPGs with character development, interactive storylines, and discussing gameplay experiences with friends. Whether you are an experienced player or a newcomer, this guide will introduce you to the most common types of RPGs and help you find the perfect game to try or expand your horizons.

What Are Role-Playing Games?
RPGs allow players to embody a character within a game that also serves as a narrative. The choices made by players influence their characters and shape the story's trajectory. The story responds to these choices, sometimes guided by a computer and other times by another player.

Typically, RPGs feature a structure where players assume the role of a single character. They have the freedom to decide their character's appearance, behavior, and abilities within the story. These characters remain part of the story until one of three events occur: their demise, removal by a game element, or the player's desire to switch characters.

In this traditional setup, one player acts as the Game Master (also known as Dungeon Master, Judge, Referee, Keeper, or other similar titles). The Game Master ensures the story stays on track, reacts to player actions, portrays supporting or antagonist characters, and resolves rule disputes. Game Mastering can be a challenging yet rewarding role for players who wish to be at the heart of every game session.

Some RPGs offer a more collaborative structure where everyone has an equal say in the narrative. Game rules determine who controls the story at any given moment. These games often aim to emulate specific genres or the atmosphere of different media forms, such as films or television shows.

Dungeons & Dragons, published in 1974, is widely regarded as the earliest and most influential role-playing game. While other games may have existed prior to it, Dungeons & Dragons captured an enormous audience and inspired countless other games, including many in the video game industry. RPGs on home computers and game consoles gained popularity in the 1980s and have progressively become more intricate over time.

Even today, Dungeons & Dragons remains the most renowned tabletop RPG, having recently made waves in the computer gaming realm with Baldur's Gate 3. However, there are numerous RPG styles to explore, each with its own unique strengths that appeal to dedicated fan bases.

Types Of RPG Games
Categorizing RPGs can be challenging due to the myriad of features and focuses that often blur the lines between different styles. Nonetheless, here are some of the most common RPG genres along with notable examples.

MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game)
MMORPGs are online games played by thousands, or even millions, of individuals. Players connect to a central server, create and develop their characters, and embark on quests. Some servers emphasize completing missions and maximizing character performance, while others encourage role-playing and maintaining character personalities.

World of Warcraft remains the most popular MMORPG, with other notable examples including Guild Wars 2, EVE Online, Star Wars: The Old Republic, and Black Desert Online.

ARPG (Action Role-Playing Game)
Action role-playing games place a strong emphasis on combat as a core gameplay element. Players must learn how to fight and equip their characters adequately. While these games often focus on single-player battles, some also offer multiplayer components.

The Diablo series exemplifies this RPG style, along with games like Elder Ring, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Borderlands.

CRPG (Computer or Console Role-Playing Game)
CRPGs encompass RPGs played on computers or video game consoles. These games usually provide a scripted single-player experience, guiding players through a specific storyline while allowing for some exploration within dungeons or restricted areas.

When people think of CRPGs, titles from Bioware like Mass Effect and Dragon Age often come to mind. The term is also used to describe games such as Planescape: Torment, Disco Elysium, and Shadowrun Returns.

JRPG (Japanese Role-Playing Game)
JRPGs originated on game consoles in Japan. These games often blend genres like fantasy and science fiction, placing an emphasis on party management and exploring the dramatic relationships that unfold within save-the-world storylines.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fb562b1ede4feb9fc02f0c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1795,1010,x0,y92,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 12:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/grrlscientist/2024/03/24/birding-under-the-influence-by-dorian-anderson---review/,Birding Under The Influence By Dorian Anderson - Review,"In Birding Under the Influence: Cycling Across America in Search of Birds and Recovery, author Dorian Anderson takes readers on a captivating journey of self-discovery and healing. As a neuroscientist battling alcohol and drug addiction, Anderson embarks on a year-long quest to observe as many bird species as possible, known as a Big Year, while bicycling across the United States.

The memoir begins with Anderson's decision to leave behind his high-powered research career after two years of failure. With a Type-A personality, he redirects his addictive tendencies towards a healthier pursuit - bird watching. Inspired by a bike trip to Nantucket, Massachusetts, to see two Northern Lapwings, Anderson sets out on his bicycling Big Year, despite his lack of experience with long-distance cycling.

From the moment Anderson leaves Boston on January 1, 2014, his physical journey is filled with countless dangers and challenges. He faces harsh weather conditions, narrowly avoids accidents on busy roads, battles strong winds, encounters hostile drivers and dogs, and experiences numerous biking mishaps. Throughout the journey, Anderson gains a deep appreciation for the diverse beauty of the American landscape, from the Florida Everglades to the Rocky Mountains of Colorado and the Redwood forests of Oregon.

Long-distance bicycling provides Anderson with ample time for self-reflection. He shares his personal struggles, academic achievements, and scientific research, as well as his battles with addiction that began in high school. As he tests his physical and psychological limits, Anderson envisions a future free from drugs and alcohol.

Anderson's nightly blog about his adventures on the road attracts the attention of a unique community of birders across the country. These individuals offer him meals, beds, and warm showers, providing a glimpse into regional American subcultures.

Over the course of 12 months, Anderson bicycles 17,830 miles through 28 states, walks at least 493 miles, and kayaks eight miles in pursuit of both common and rare bird species. He also raises nearly $50,000 for bird habitat conservation. By the end of his Big Year, Anderson has become physically fit and has spotted a remarkable 618 bird species. On Thanksgiving Day, he even documents a species never before reported in the United States - a female/juvenile red-legged honeycreeper, causing local birders to flock to Estero Llaño Grande State Park to witness this rare sighting.

While the memoir is generally well-written, closer editing would have improved the prose and smoothed the transitions between the adventure and self-reflection sections. Despite this, Anderson's narrative remains captivating as he confronts his personal demons with unwavering honesty while maintaining the excitement and wonder of his birding adventure.

One aspect that could have enhanced the book is the inclusion of maps detailing Anderson's journey. Maps would have made it easier for readers to follow along and visualize his adventure. Additionally, a final state-by-state tally of the bird species Anderson observed would have been a valuable addition.

Birding Under the Influence: Cycling Across America in Search of Birds and Recovery is a poignant memoir that not only chronicles the author's journey to overcome addiction but also highlights the beauty of the natural world and the kindness of strangers. Anderson's story serves as an inspiration to anyone facing their own personal struggles, showing that healing and transformation are possible with determination and a deep connection to nature.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff194d2ccb9152d392146c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=812,456,x0,y57,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 12:17:44,Innovation,Innovation
