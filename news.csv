However, there is a unique accelerator program called Discipulus Ventures that stands out from the rest. Unlike most programs, Discipulus Ventures seeks out founders who are explicitly aligned with classically conservative values such as family, patriotism, and faith.

Discipulus Ventures recently kicked off its first 10-person cohort. This mentorship program for young founders aims to bring together a rather idiosyncratic type of person in the tech industry. They are looking for individuals who possess the idealism of Plato and the rationalism of Aristotle, along with a strong drive to revive a Norman Rockwellâ€“esque Americana.

Unlike other accelerator programs that focus on building B2B SaaS companies, Discipulus Ventures focuses on hard tech, defense, and industry-related problems. They are interested in what is sometimes broadly referred to as ""American Dynamism.""

The program's website clearly states that they are seeking student founders who have a strict devotion to truth and goodness. They want individuals whose vision of the future combines their entrepreneurship, personal virtue, and obligation to the country. The emphasis on values stems from the belief held by the program's three founders that young people are not working on solving some of the hardest problems confronting the country because their values are no longer pushing them toward mission-driven companies.

In a recent interview, one of Discipulus' founders, Jakob Diepenbrock, highlighted a poll from the Wall Street Journal and the nonpartisan research organization NORC. The poll found that values like patriotism, religion, and having children have significantly declined among Americans since the late 1990s. On the other hand, the desire to make money has increased.

Diepenbrock and his co-founders, Isaac Yi and William Pan, have observed these shifting values among students on university campuses. They have noticed that students are flocking to entrepreneurship as a means to an end, whether that be making quick cash or fitting in with their peers. This trend concerns them because they believe that starting a company should be driven by the right reasons, not just because it's a popular thing to do.

Furthermore, they have noticed a general constriction in the types of thinking and speaking that take place on university campuses. Students are becoming afraid to express their opinions and values, which hinders their ability to solve important problems. If they can't even talk about these problems, they won't be able to find solutions.

Discipulus Ventures was created as a response to these challenges. The program aims to provide a supportive community for young founders, offering mentorship and opportunities to work with experienced professionals. Each day of the program consists of community building, talks, and mentorship sessions. The week culminates in a demo day where the founders present their projects to a group of investors.

The program is taking place in El Segundo, California, a city known for hosting major aerospace companies like Boeing and Northrop Grumman. This location is attracting a new type of hard tech founder, similar to the type that Discipulus Ventures is targeting. The city's reputation has grown as a breeding ground for innovative ideas and technological progress.

In summary, Discipulus Ventures is a unique accelerator program that focuses on young founders who are aligned with classically conservative values. They believe that values play a crucial role in driving individuals to work on important problems facing the country. By cultivating a community of like-minded individuals, Discipulus Ventures aims to support these founders in their mission-driven endeavors.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/discipulus-ventures-2.jpeg?resize=1200,952",2024-03-26 21:42:19,Innovation,Innovation
