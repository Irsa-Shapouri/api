https://www.zdnet.com/article/saving-hours-of-work-with-ai-how-chatgpt-became-my-virtual-assistant-for-a-data-project/,Saving hours of work with AI: How ChatGPT became my virtual assistant for a data project,"Generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT have gained a lot of attention recently. While they can be impressive, it's important to remember that they are just tools, similar to other productivity software. In this article, I will share a project where ChatGPT saved me time and discuss how you can leverage it for your own projects.

Recently, I worked on a ""stunt article"" where I aimed to see how much computer gear I could buy from Temu for under $100. To put the article together, I had to browse the Temu site for items to feature. For example, I found an iPad keyboard and mouse that cost around $6. To stick to my budget, I needed to add all the Temu links to a spreadsheet, find the prices for each product, and rearrange them until I reached my desired total budget of $99.77.

The challenge I faced was converting the Temu links into a usable format. This is where ChatGPT came in handy.

Phase 1 involved gathering all the links. I copied each link from Temu and pasted it onto a Notion page. Notion allows you to create bookmark blocks, which not only store the links but also the product names. Once I selected all the blocks, I copied them and pasted them into a text editor. Although the page looked messy, the result was useful.

Phase 2 was about identifying the data within the blocks. Each block had three key elements: the product name, the base URL, and irrelevant tracking data. I only needed the main URL. To prepare the data for ChatGPT, I included delimiters to separate the elements.

In Phase 3, I taught ChatGPT to recognize the data. I provided ChatGPT with the prompt to accept the data and await further instructions. Then, I copied the information from the text editor and pasted it into ChatGPT. At this point, ChatGPT knew to wait for more details. The crucial step was instructing ChatGPT to extract the titles and links while discarding the unnecessary information. This allowed me to name the data and test whether ChatGPT understood the assignment.

ChatGPT successfully completed the assignment, but it stopped before finishing due to its buffer running out. I instructed it to continue, and it provided the rest of the data. This entire process, which would have been time-consuming if done manually, was completed by ChatGPT in less than a minute.

In Phase 4, I focused on cleaning up Temu's complex titles. For my project, the titles were too long and convoluted. I wanted simpler titles that conveyed the essence of the product. For example, instead of ""10 Inch LCD Writing Tablet, Electronis Memo With Leather Protective Case, Electronic Drawing Board For Digital Handwriting Pad Doodle Board, Gifts For,"" I preferred ""LCD writing tablet with case."" I assigned this task to ChatGPT as well, reminding it of the previous steps it had taken. This reminder helped ChatGPT more reliably incorporate the new instructions.

By leveraging ChatGPT, I was able to save time and streamline the process of converting Temu links into usable data. ChatGPT's ability to understand prompts and perform specific tasks made it a valuable tool for this project. While this may not be a project you need to replicate, it demonstrates the potential of using ChatGPT as a workhorse tool for various projects.

In conclusion, generative AI tools like ChatGPT can be powerful assets in your workflow. By understanding their capabilities and structuring prompts effectively, you can harness their potential to enhance productivity and efficiency.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/70d8814af33b190ff84b8faa5f9bafe13d3586e2/2024/03/25/7d1cb1ff-3bb7-4972-a6cd-33d04da76bc1/cover.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/lucid-motors-1-billion-saudi-arabia-gravity-suv/,Lucid Motors raises another $1 billion from Saudi Arabia as it searches for luxury EV buyers,"Lucid Motors, the luxury electric vehicle manufacturer, has secured an additional $1 billion in funding from its major investor, Saudi Arabia. Ayar Third Investment, an affiliate of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, will purchase $1 billion worth of Lucid's stock, increasing the Kingdom's ownership stake to approximately 60%. This funding aims to mitigate the high costs associated with producing and selling Lucid's luxury electric sedan.

Recently, Lucid revealed its plans to manufacture around 9,000 units of its Air electric vehicles this year, a slight increase from the previous year. The company experienced a loss of $2.8 billion in 2023 and ended the year with nearly $1.4 billion in cash and equivalents. Lucid has faced challenges in finding buyers for its expensive Air sedan and has resorted to reducing prices multiple times in recent months to stimulate sales. Additionally, Lucid intends to commence production of its electric Gravity SUV by the end of this year.

The announcement of this investment comes shortly after CEO Peter Rawlinson expressed caution regarding excessive reliance on Saudi Arabia for financial support. Rawlinson emphasized the need to avoid assuming that the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund has endless wealth at its disposal. He stated, ""If I adopt a mindset that there is bottomless wealth from PIF, that is very dangerous, that is something I will never do, I respect them far too much for that.""

The new funding from Saudi Arabia marks a significant boost for Lucid Motors as it strives to overcome financial obstacles and strengthen its position in the electric vehicle market. With this infusion of capital, Lucid can continue its efforts to produce high-quality electric vehicles that appeal to a broader consumer base.

Lucid's decision to expand its collaboration with Saudi Arabia reflects the Kingdom's commitment to investing in the future of the automotive industry. As the world transitions towards sustainable transportation solutions, Saudi Arabia recognizes the importance of supporting innovative companies like Lucid Motors that are at the forefront of electric vehicle technology.

By securing this substantial investment, Lucid can focus on refining its business strategy, enhancing its manufacturing capabilities, and expanding its product portfolio. The company's planned introduction of the electric Gravity SUV demonstrates its commitment to offering a diverse range of electric vehicles to meet the evolving needs of consumers.

Despite the challenges faced by Lucid in attracting buyers for its luxury electric sedans, the company remains optimistic about its future prospects. The additional funding from Saudi Arabia will undoubtedly provide Lucid with the necessary resources to navigate through these challenges and establish itself as a prominent player in the electric vehicle market.

In conclusion, Lucid Motors has secured $1 billion in funding from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund to support its expansion and mitigate the costs associated with producing and selling its luxury electric sedan.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/uk-government-electoral-breach-voter-data-china/,UK blames China for massive breach of voter data,"The U.K. government has announced that China is responsible for a cyberattack in 2021 that exposed the personal information of millions of U.K. voters. Oliver Dowden, the U.K. deputy prime minister, made the statement to lawmakers in Parliament, stating that the breach at the Electoral Commission was carried out by hackers working for the Chinese government. This is the first time that the United Kingdom has officially attributed the cyberattack to China since it was first disclosed in 2023.

The Electoral Commission, which holds the U.K. register of citizens eligible to vote, revealed that hackers obtained the names and addresses of approximately 40 million U.K. citizens. This includes individuals who were registered to vote between 2014 and 2022, as well as overseas voters. The breach began in 2021 but went undetected for a year. The U.K. National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) stated that it is highly likely that the Chinese hackers accessed and exfiltrated emails and data from the electoral register during the attack. The NCSC also warned that Chinese intelligence could potentially use this data for large-scale espionage and to target dissidents and critics within the U.K.

In addition to the data breach at the Electoral Commission, Dowden revealed that a separate attempted cyberattack by a China-backed hacking group targeted the email accounts of U.K. lawmakers in 2021. Fortunately, the attempted breaches were mitigated by parliamentary authorities before any email accounts were compromised. The NCSC attributed these attempted email hacks to a group of Chinese hackers known as APT31, which is notorious for targeting the online accounts of foreign government officials. APT31 utilizes malware that can create backdoors into systems and steal sensitive information. In the past, the Norwegian government attributed a 2018 data breach to APT31.

The U.K. did not disclose which lawmakers' email accounts were targeted, but the NCSC stated that most of the affected lawmakers have been vocal in exposing China's malicious activities. The Chinese Embassy in the U.K. denied the allegations and emphasized that China does not support or condone cyberattacks, but stated that they would use lawful methods to counter such attacks.

The Biden administration also accused several Chinese hackers on the same day of being involved in APT31's attempts to target U.S.-based companies. In 2020, Google security researchers linked APT31 to the targeting of email accounts belonging to the Trump and Biden presidential campaigns. Furthermore, leaked documents from Chinese government contractor I-Soon revealed how the private contractor conducts hacking operations on behalf of the Chinese authorities against other governments.

These recent revelations highlight a concerning pattern of behavior exhibited by China-affiliated actors, not only against the U.K. but also against other countries. The NCSC condemns the targeting of democratic systems and vows to continue exposing cyber actors that pose a threat to the fundamental institutions and values of society.

In conclusion, the U.K. government has officially attributed a 2021 cyberattack on the Electoral Commission to hackers working for the Chinese government. This breach compromised the personal information of millions of U.K. voters. Additionally, a separate attempted cyberattack targeted the email accounts of U.K. lawmakers, which was attributed to a group of Chinese hackers known as APT31. The U.K. and the Biden administration have both accused China of engaging in malicious cyber activities. These revelations underscore the need to address and counter cyber threats to protect the democratic systems and values that underpin society.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/uk-polling-booth-elections-cyberattack.jpg?resize=1200,777",2024-03-25 15:50:23,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/fisker-nissan-deal-dead-funding-bankruptcy/,"Fisker loses potential Nissan deal, putting rescue funds at risk","The negotiations between Fisker and a large automaker have come to an end, leaving the startup's near-term funding efforts in jeopardy. Fisker announced in a regulatory filing that the automaker terminated the negotiations on March 22, but did not provide a reason for the decision. The negotiations were a closing condition for a potential $150 million convertible note, and Fisker will now ask the unnamed investor to waive the condition. This development has led to a 28% drop in Fisker's stock, and trading has been halted.

This is the latest setback for the troubled EV startup. Fisker has been struggling to sell its Ocean SUV, failing to meet its internal sales goals. This has forced the company to shift away from a direct sales model. Additionally, Fisker has been plagued by quality problems with some of the cars that have been delivered. Internal documents reveal that the company has had difficulties in resolving these issues.

To add to their troubles, Fisker recently laid off 15% of its staff and reported having only $121 million in its bank account. With production paused, the company has warned investors that it will not survive another year without fresh funding. While Fisker had engaged in talks with other automakers, including Mazda, only Nissan remained at the negotiating table.

In response to the termination of negotiations with Nissan, Fisker is now exploring other options. The company is considering ""strategic alternatives,"" which could include in or out of court restructurings, capital market transactions, debt refinancing, equity issuances, asset sales, or other strategic measures.

Despite these challenges, Fisker remains determined to find a solution and secure its future. The company is actively pursuing other opportunities and remains optimistic about its prospects. While the termination of negotiations with Nissan is a setback, Fisker is committed to exploring all available options to ensure its survival in the highly competitive EV market.

In conclusion, Fisker's negotiations with a large automaker have been terminated, putting the company's near-term funding efforts at risk. The startup has been struggling to sell its Ocean SUV and has faced quality issues with some of its delivered vehicles. With layoffs and limited funds, Fisker is in a precarious position. However, the company remains resilient and is actively seeking alternative strategies to secure its future. Despite this setback, Fisker is determined to weather the storm and emerge stronger in the EV market.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1236611991.jpg?resize=1200,759",2024-03-25 13:52:11,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/elon-musk-x-ccdh-california-lawsuit-dismissed/,A judge just killed Elon Musk's lawsuit against an anti-hate research org,"A federal judge has ruled against Elon Musk and X in a lawsuit against the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH). The lawsuit was filed by X, accusing CCDH of spreading misleading claims and causing financial losses. Musk personally directed the lawsuit and referred to CCDH as ""an evil propaganda machine."" The lawsuit also alleged that CCDH had illegally scraped data and violated platform rules by using a third-party social media monitoring tool. However, the judge dismissed the lawsuit, stating that it was brought to punish CCDH for criticizing X and to deter others from engaging in such criticism.

The CCDH is a nonprofit organization that conducts research on hate speech, extremism, and misinformation on major social networks. It was formed in 2018 and regularly publishes reports highlighting disturbing content on social platforms. The organization's research includes topics such as eating disorder content on TikTok, climate denial on YouTube, and violent misogynistic threats on Instagram. The CCDH aims to hold social media companies accountable for their decisions that impact society.

In response to the ruling, CCDH CEO Imran Ahmed emphasized the importance of the organization's work in exposing lies and hate. He stated that the court's decision affirmed their right to research, speak, and advocate for fundamental rights and civil liberties. The CCDH's legal team, which included Roberta Kaplan, celebrated the ruling as a victory against the attempt to bend the rule of law.

While the ruling in California is a relief for researchers tracking online extremism, Musk is pursuing a similar lawsuit against Media Matters for America, a left-leaning media watchdog. However, this lawsuit is taking place in Texas, which lacks the same protections against frivolous lawsuits that California has.

This ruling highlights the ongoing battle between individuals and organizations seeking to hold social media platforms accountable for their content moderation practices and those who perceive such efforts as threats to free speech. The outcome of these legal battles will have significant implications for the future of online discourse and the responsibilities of social media companies.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/twitter-x-logo-musk-pattern.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-25 20:33:17,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/dma-first-formal-probes/,"Apple, Google and Meta face first formal investigations under EU's DMA","The European Union has recently launched several investigations into Big Tech companies, including Alphabet/Google, Apple, and Meta, under the Digital Markets Act (DMA). These investigations mark the first formal non-compliance probes under the EU's updated competition rulebook.

Alphabet/Google is being scrutinized for its rules on steering in Google Play and its approach to self-preferencing in search results. Apple is also under investigation for its rules on steering in the App Store and the design of choice screens for alternatives to its Safari web browser. The EU will examine Meta's ""pay or consent"" model as well.

A total of five investigations were announced on Monday, less than three weeks after the compliance deadline for these companies. These gatekeepers, designated under the pan-EU market power and contestability regulation, face formal investigation to determine if they are violating the rulebook, as suspected by the Commission. Non-compliance with the DMA can result in fines of up to 10% of global annual turnover, or even 20% for repeat offenses.

According to the DMA's recommended timeframes, the EU has up to 12 months to conclude the investigations, with a preliminary report possible within six months. However, the duration of the probes may vary from these guidelines.

These enforcement actions by the EU coincide with increased antitrust scrutiny on these three US firms within their home market as well.

Criticism has emerged regarding the compliance plans presented by these companies under the DMA. Google has been accused of attempting to circumvent the ban on self-preferencing by introducing new rich features in search results that unfairly compete with rivals. Apple's use of notifications to warn users about risks outside its ecosystem has been criticized by developers as ""scare screens."" Meta's ""pay or be tracked"" tactic has also faced condemnation from privacy and consumer rights groups. The Commission has even raised questions about Meta's practices under the DMA's sister regulation, the Digital Services Act.

The Commission expressed concern about Alphabet and Apple's measures related to their app stores potentially breaching the DMA. The DMA requires gatekeepers to allow app developers to ""steer"" consumers to offers outside their app stores free of charge. The Commission found that the companies' steering measures may not fully comply with these requirements, citing various restrictions and limitations that impede developers' ability to communicate and promote offers.

Regarding Google's self-preferencing, the EU investigation will focus on the impact of Google's vertical search services, such as Google Shopping, Google Flights, and Google Hotels, on rival services.

The Commission is concerned that Alphabet's compliance measures may not ensure fair and non-discriminatory treatment of third-party services featured on Google's search results page, as required by the DMA.

The EU will also examine whether Apple is fulfilling its user choice obligations on iOS, including the ability to easily uninstall apps, change default settings, and select alternative default services. The design of the web browser choice screen will be a particular focus.

As for Meta, the EU will investigate whether its ""pay or consent"" model for EU users complies with the DMA. The regulation requires gatekeepers to obtain user consent when combining or cross-using personal data across different core platform services. The Commission is concerned that Meta's binary choice may not provide a genuine alternative if users do not consent, thereby failing to prevent the accumulation of personal data.

During a press conference, Thierry Breton, the EU's internal market commissioner, emphasized that the DMA clearly mandates gatekeepers to offer free, non-preferential treatment to third-party services.

Overall, the EU's investigations into Big Tech companies are a significant step in ensuring compliance with the DMA and promoting fair competition in the digital market. These probes will shed light on potential violations and help maintain a level playing field for all players involved.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1031626648.jpg?resize=1200,799",2024-03-25 12:10:10,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/gostudent-tutoring-profitability/,"GoStudent, the online learning platform, says it's now profitable","GoStudent, the Austrian online tutoring marketplace, has achieved profitability, marking a significant milestone for the company. CEO Felix Ohswald stated that GoStudent is not only EBITDA positive but also has positive operating cashflow across its global operations. This achievement comes after a challenging period for the company, which saw a crash in the online learning market and a decline in customer demand. In 2021, GoStudent reported a loss of €89 million, which increased to €220 million in 2022, leading to layoffs and cost cuts. However, the company has now turned its fortunes around and is focusing on sustainable growth.

GoStudent experienced rapid growth between 2019 and 2022, scaling its core business model to over €100 million in revenue. However, the company also had a cash burn of over €150 million in 2022 alone. As the market conditions changed, GoStudent realized it needed to reduce its spending. In 2023, the company decreased its burn rate by 70%, but it was still not enough. This led to multiple rounds of layoffs, which were challenging but necessary for the company's survival. GoStudent has learned valuable lessons from this experience and is now more cautious about scaling and spending.

The Covid-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the edtech industry, and GoStudent was no exception. The company went from having to convince parents about the benefits of online tutoring to becoming the go-to solution for students in need of educational support. However, despite the increase in demand, GoStudent was still burning cash and needed to find a way to become profitable. The company made several cuts, including reducing expenses on parties, pausing acquisitions, and refraining from expanding into new markets where online tutoring was not established. It also exited the U.S. market after a short period and shifted its focus to Europe.

GoStudent's new strategy involves a more organic approach to growth, focusing on European markets. The company no longer aims to be present in 20 countries but instead wants to provide personalized tutoring to students globally. To achieve this, GoStudent acquired Studienkreis, a physical learning center with 1,000 locations primarily in Germany. This acquisition allows GoStudent to offer hybrid learning, combining online tutoring with physical learning centers. The company believes that the future of education is hybrid and aims to leverage technology to match students with the right tutors, regardless of their location.

Most of GoStudent's tutors are university students, which makes it easier for them to connect with students while providing academic support. The company's personalized approach to tutoring sets it apart from traditional schools and emphasizes its mission to unlock the potential of every student. GoStudent's focus on bottom-line growth, rather than top-line growth, will be crucial in achieving its goal of becoming the leading global school. Balancing cost-effective scaling with personalized tutoring will be a challenge, but GoStudent is determined to provide high-quality education to students worldwide.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Founders-of-GoStudent-Gregor-Muller-I-Felix-Ohswald-2.jpg?w=1024,2024-03-25 11:00:36,Innovation,Innovation

Although it was originally intended to be projected on four walls, the triptich presented on three big screens still managed to provide an immersive experience. Powered by Stable Diffusion, a local version of the text to image generator, the Golden Key created themed images based on unrelated short fairy tales. Guests were even allowed to add their own prompts, which manifested in real-time and added to the evolving narrative. The lightning-fast generation of images from fairy tales truly felt like a new medium unfolding before our eyes.

Marc Da Costa and Matthew Niederhauser directed the Golden Key, and their work was nothing short of a revelation. It was an entirely new experience, a new medium that captivated the audience. Da Costa and Niederhauser also presented Tulpamancer, which had previously been showcased at the Venice Film Festival. In this experience, participants interacted with a tulpa through a retro computer terminal. They answered questions about their own lives and were then invited to enter a virtual world uniquely created for them. With the help of a VR headset, participants embarked on a journey guided by their tulpa, exploring virtual scenes that invoked and questioned their memories and potential fates.

Soul Paint, written and directed by Sarah Ticho and Niki Smit, and produced by Anna Firbank, received a Special XR Jury Award. This project was truly captivating, offering a unique experience to the audience. There were also other notable projects in the XR experience area. Astra, created by Eliza McKnitt, took the audience to space, much like her previous award-winning XR experience, Spheres. Impulse, on the other hand, shared the stories of individuals suffering from ADHD. These experiences showcased the potential of Mixed Reality, which merges the real world with the digital using outward-facing HD cameras.

Reimagined Volume III: Young Thang, produced by a female-led team in partnership with Meta, introduced a new kind of storybook experience. This VR animation series showcased lesser-known fables, mythology, and folklore, offering a fresh perspective. Shadowtime, another Venice selection, offered a poetic contemplation of escapism and real-world threats, such as Climate Change. Both projects were thought-provoking and showcased the power of VR in storytelling.

Detachment, a satiric VR experience from Ristband, was also worth mentioning. Ristband, known for its live mixed reality concerts, took the audience on a cinematic journey following a voice-over actor trying to decipher a script. Their SXSW Official Future x Music event, featuring an ambisonic A/V installation, mixed reality concert, and performances from international artists, demonstrated the fusion of game design, cinema, virtual reality, and live performance. Ristband showcased how artists are leveraging new technology to tap into their creative potential.

The event itself was described as a transformative and immersive journey between the physical and the digital. Attendees used Pico Neo 4E mixed reality headsets, provided by MACE Virtual Labs, to experience a series of fully immersive virtual dreamscapes. This allowed them to shift their consciousness away from the physical surroundings and into a fantastical world.

Overall, SXSW 2024 was a remarkable event that showcased groundbreaking XR experiences. The Golden Key, Tulpamancer, Soul Paint, Astra, Impulse, Reimagined Volume III: Young Thang, Shadowtime, and Detachment were just a few of the incredible projects on display. The fusion of technology and artistry created a new medium that left the audience in awe. This event highlighted the endless possibilities of XR and its potential to revolutionize storytelling.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660200d15ac92b36fd540aa5/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=937,527,x48,y0,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 18:57:26,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/lesliekatz/2024/03/25/artists-get-early-access-to-openais-sora-video-tool-with-surreal-results/,OpenAI Gave Artists Early Access To Sora. See The Videos They Created,"""Air Head"" is a short film that showcases the creative potential of OpenAI's Sora text-to-video tool. Created by Toronto-based multimedia production company Shy Kids, this film features a protagonist with a balloon for a head, resulting in a surreal and whimsical narrative.

The balloon-headed character humorously describes the joys and challenges of living with such an unusual anatomical anomaly. Windy days cause his head to blow off his shoulders, and navigating a cactus aisle in a plant store becomes a prickly situation. Despite these difficulties, he maintains a grateful perspective, recognizing that we are all susceptible to deflation.

OpenAI's Sora tool, which generates videos up to a minute long from a single text prompt, remains in the assessment phase. The company is actively working to determine the tool's capabilities, limitations, and potential risks. Early testers, including Shy Kids and OpenAI's first artist in residence, Alexander Reben, have played a crucial role in providing feedback and insights.

While generative AI tools like Sora have sparked both enthusiasm and concerns within the creative community, those granted early access appear to be overwhelmingly excited about its possibilities. Josephine Miller, creative director of London-based Oraar Studio, praises Sora for challenging her creative process and allowing her to evolve in storytelling. Her short film immerses viewers in a dreamy subaquatic world where humans gracefully move in garments adorned with iridescent fish-like scales.

Don Allen Stevenson III, the creator of another featured film, emphasizes how Sora liberates creators from technical constraints, enabling them to focus on pure creativity and instant visualization. The seven showcased short films span various genres, moods, and visual styles, offering a glimpse into the boundless imagination that Sora can unlock.

Nik Kleverov, co-founder and creative director of L.A.-based creative agency Native Foreign, believes that Sora will revolutionize his approach to agency work and personal projects. By providing the ability to iterate and explore original concepts without budgetary and resource constraints, Sora opens up new possibilities for creators.

The films highlighted in OpenAI's recent blog post demonstrate the transformative potential of generative AI tools like Sora. These tools have the power to enhance creativity, facilitate rapid prototyping, and push the boundaries of imagination. While concerns about copyright issues and job displacement exist, the artists involved in Sora's early testing phase express excitement about the tool's ability to bring their ideas to life.

The future of generative AI remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: it has the potential to revolutionize the creative process and empower artists to explore uncharted territories. As OpenAI continues to refine Sora, we can anticipate even more remarkable creations that blur the line between reality and unfettered imagination.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660206f5826dc2b2a5012a5a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1530,918,x225,y165,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 19:50:18,Innovation,Innovation
