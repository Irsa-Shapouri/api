https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-liquid-iron-battery-grid-energy.html,New all-liquid iron flow battery for grid energy storage,"The Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory has developed a new battery design that repurposes a commonplace chemical used in water treatment facilities for large-scale energy storage. This design offers a safe, economical, water-based, flow battery made with Earth-abundant materials, providing another solution for integrating intermittent energy sources like wind and solar energy into the electric grid.

In a report published in Nature Communications, the researchers highlight the remarkable cycling stability of their lab-scale, iron-based battery. It maintained 98.7% of its maximum capacity over one thousand consecutive charging cycles, demonstrating significant improvements compared to previous studies on similar batteries.

Iron-based flow batteries have been in existence since the 1980s, and some are commercially available. However, this battery stands out because it stores energy in a unique liquid chemical formula that combines charged iron with a neutral-pH phosphate-based liquid electrolyte called nitrogenous triphosphonate (NTMPA). NTMPA is a commercially available chemical in industrial quantities due to its use in inhibiting corrosion in water treatment plants.

Phosphonates, including NTMPA, are part of a chemical family based on phosphorus. They dissolve well in water and are commonly used in fertilizers, detergents, and other applications.

Modernizing the U.S. electric grid and finding ways to store energy from renewable sources like wind and solar power requires new flow battery technologies. The researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory aimed to develop battery materials that are Earth-abundant and can be sourced domestically. They specifically searched for an electrolyte that could bind and store charged iron in a liquid complex at room temperature and neutral pH.

Flow batteries consist of two chambers filled with different liquids. They charge through an electrochemical reaction and store energy in chemical bonds. When connected to an external circuit, they release the stored energy to power electrical devices. Unlike conventional batteries, flow batteries have two external supply tanks of liquid constantly circulating through them, serving as the battery system's ""blood supply."" The size of the electrolyte supply tank determines the energy storage capacity of the flow battery.

Flow batteries can serve as backup generators for the electric grid and play a crucial role in decarbonization strategies by storing energy from renewable sources. They can be built at various scales, from lab-bench scale to the size of a city block.

In the short term, grid operators are interested in locating battery energy storage systems (BESS) in urban or suburban areas close to energy consumers. However, safety concerns often arise. The aqueous flow battery developed by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory could address these concerns because it operates in water at neutral pH.

According to Aaron Hollas, a study author and team leader in PNNL's Battery Materials and Systems Group, a BESS facility using similar chemistry could take advantage of operating in water at neutral pH. The system also uses commercially available reagents that haven't been previously explored for use in flow batteries.

The initial design of the battery has an energy density of up to 9 watt-hours per liter (Wh/L). While commercialized vanadium-based systems are more than twice as energy-dense at 25 Wh/L, batteries with higher energy density can store more energy in a smaller space. However, a system built with Earth-abundant materials can still be scaled to provide the same energy output.

Future development of this iron-based flow battery aims to increase its energy density and improve its performance. The researchers also plan to explore more cost-effective and sustainable materials for large-scale energy storage.

Overall, this new battery design offers a promising solution for energy storage, contributing to the modernization of the electric grid and the integration of renewable energy sources. Its utilization of a commonplace chemical and Earth-abundant materials makes it a cost-effective and sustainable option. With further advancements, this technology could revolutionize the way we store and utilize energy.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/new-all-liquid-iron-fl.jpg,2024-03-25 07:22:25,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.zdnet.com/article/saving-hours-of-work-with-ai-how-chatgpt-became-my-virtual-assistant-for-a-data-project/,Saving hours of work with AI: How ChatGPT became my virtual assistant for a data project,"Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been the talk of the town lately, with people marveling at its capabilities and potential. As someone who has been fascinated by this technology, I have even contributed to the buzz. However, it's important to remember that tools like ChatGPT are just that - tools. They can be utilized to assist in various projects, much like other productivity software.

Today, I want to share with you a project where ChatGPT saved me a significant amount of time and effort. While you may not have a similar project at hand, I hope that my thought process and approach will inspire you to consider using ChatGPT as a valuable tool for your own projects.

Let's dive into the project itself. In about a month, I plan to publish what I like to call a ""stunt article."" These articles are fun and captivating, designed to pique the interest of readers. The specific article I'm working on is a compilation of the computer gear I managed to purchase from Temu for under $100. In fact, I was able to stay just below the budget with a total of $99.77.

To create this article, I had to scour the Temu website for noteworthy items. For instance, I stumbled upon an iPad keyboard and mouse priced at a mere $6. In order to remain within my $100 budget, I wanted to add all the Temu links to a spreadsheet, identify the prices of each item, and rearrange things until I achieved the desired total budget.

However, a challenge presented itself when it came to converting the Temu links into a usable format. This is where ChatGPT came to my rescue.

Phase 1: Gathering the links
The first step was to collect all the links. For each product, I simply copied the link from the Temu website and pasted it into a Notion page. Notion offers the option to create bookmark blocks when pasting a URL, which not only contain the links but also include the product names. Here's a snapshot of that page:

[Insert snapshot here]

As you can see, I began selecting the blocks containing the links. Once all the blocks were selected, I copied them and pasted the entire set into a text editor. Although the page looked messy, the result was exactly what I needed.

Phase 2: Identifying the data
Let's take a closer look at one of the data blocks. To make it easier for you to see the data elements within the block, I switched my editor out of dark mode. Here's what it looks like:

[Insert snapshot here]

Within each block, there are three key elements. The product name is denoted by gold text surrounded by braces. The base URL of the product is shown in green text, surrounded by parentheses. There's also a question mark that separates the main page URL from additional tracking data passed to the Temu page. However, for my purposes, I only needed the main URL. The purple sections highlight the delimiters, which are the data we'll feed into ChatGPT.

Phase 3: Teaching ChatGPT to recognize the data
To begin, I fed ChatGPT the following prompt: ""Accept the following data and await further instructions."" Then, I copied all the information from the text editor and pasted it into ChatGPT. At this point, ChatGPT was primed to receive additional details.

The next step was crucial in the project. I wanted ChatGPT to extract the titles and links while disregarding the rest. Here's the prompt I used:

[Insert prompt here]

This prompt served two purposes. Firstly, it allowed me to assign names to the data, making it easier to refer to later. Secondly, it served as a test to ensure ChatGPT understood the assignment.

ChatGPT successfully completed the assignment, but it paused when its buffer ran out, leaving about two-thirds of the data unfinished. I prompted the bot to continue, and it provided me with the remaining data. If I were to do this manually, it would have involved a tedious process of copying and pasting. However, ChatGPT completed the task in less than a minute.

Phase 4: Cleaning up Temu's titles
For my project, the titles provided by Temu were overly complex and not suitable for my article. Instead of something like ""10 Inch LCD Writing Tablet, Electronis Memo With Leather Protective Case, Electronic Drawing Board For Digital Handwriting Pad Doodle Board, Gifts For"", I wanted titles that were simpler and more concise, such as ""LCD writing tablet with case.""

I assigned this task to ChatGPT as well, reminding it that it had already parsed and identified the data. I find that reminding ChatGPT about previous steps helps it incorporate the information more reliably.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/boeing-ceo-to-leave-company-by-year-end-after-a-wave-of-safety-incidents/,Boeing CEO to leave company by year-end after a wave of safety incidents,"Boeing has recently announced that its CEO, Dave Calhoun, will be leaving the company by the end of this year. This decision comes in the wake of a series of safety incidents that have rocked the aircraft manufacturer.

One of the incidents that has caused significant concern is a cabin panel blowout on one of Boeing's planes. This incident, along with several others, has raised serious questions about the safety and reliability of Boeing's aircraft.

Boeing has been actively involved in an innovation acceleration program called Aerospace Xelerated. This program, previously known as the Aerospace Technology Institute, aims to work with startups in the aerospace industry. It remains unclear how Calhoun's departure will impact this program, and TechCrunch has reached out to Aerospace Xelerated for further information.

In a statement, Calhoun expressed his intention to focus on completing the critical work needed to stabilize and position the company for the future in the coming months. This signals a commitment to addressing the issues that have plagued Boeing and ensuring that the company can move forward.

One incident that has cast a shadow over Boeing's reputation is the emergency landing of an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 jet in January. This incident led to the grounding of 171 Max 9 jets for several weeks. This crisis has been described as Boeing's biggest safety crisis since the tragic crashes of two Max 8 jets in 2018 and 2019, which resulted in the loss of 346 lives.

In addition to Calhoun, Stan Deal, who leads Boeing's commercial airplanes business, will also be leaving the company. Stephanie Pope has been appointed to take over this role. Pope has been serving as the chief operating officer of Boeing since January of this year. Prior to that, she held the position of president and CEO of Boeing Global Services, where she was responsible for leading the company's aerospace services for customers worldwide.

This story is still developing, and more information is expected to emerge in the coming days. It is clear that Boeing is facing significant challenges in terms of safety and public perception. The departure of Calhoun and Deal, along with the appointment of Pope, indicate a commitment to addressing these issues and ensuring a safer and more reliable future for Boeing.

As the situation evolves, it is important to stay updated on the latest developments and how they may impact the aviation industry as a whole. We will continue to provide updates as more information becomes available.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1910140688.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-25 12:48:28,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/timtreadgold/2024/03/25/us-and-australia-get-cosy-over-critical-metals/,U.S. And Australia Get Cosy Over Critical Metals,"The global pursuit of critical metals, essential for innovative technologies and renewable energy, is strengthening the relationship between the U.S. and Australia, while creating a divide with China. Recent developments involving lithium and rare earths highlight this trend.

Pilbara Minerals, a successful lithium miner in Australia, has expressed its interest in closer ties with the U.S. and the investment incentives offered, despite partnering with a Chinese company on an expansion project. The plan involves building a lithium conversion plant outside of China in collaboration with Ganfeng Lithium Group and utilizing the U.S. Government's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). While the success of this plan remains uncertain, Pilbara management is optimistic about its potential.

The Australian Financial Review recently encapsulated Pilbara's strategy with a headline stating, ""Pilbara Minerals mulls building a lithium processing plant anywhere but China."" The details of how Pilbara will structure a joint venture with a Chinese partner while still accessing the incentives provided by the IRA are yet to be determined.

Another significant agreement between Australia and the U.S. involves the monetization of a geological structure rich in rare earths and critical minerals. The U.S. Government's trade finance arm, the Export-Import Bank (EXIM), has issued a $600 million letter-of-interest to Australian Strategic Minerals (ASM) to aid in funding the final design and development of the Dubbo project in New South Wales, Australia. Shortly after this announcement, ASM awarded a contract to Bechtel, a prominent U.S. engineering and construction firm, to provide ore processing and infrastructure technical services. This collaboration between a government financing agency and a major engineering company solidifies U.S. involvement in the Dubbo project, which has been in the evaluation process for 30 years.

Ailie MacAdam, President of Bechtel Mining and Metals, described the Dubbo project as having global strategic importance in the rare earths and critical mineral sector. The minerals targeted at Dubbo include neodymium and praseodymium (high-value rare earths), tantalum (used in electronics), niobium (steel hardening), hafnium (nuclear reactor control rods), and zirconium (jet engines and hydrogen fuel cells). ASM's initial challenge has been to find ways to separate these different metals, followed by the task of producing the required materials at a competitive price to meet customer demand.

The Dubbo project has been a focus of the Australia-U.S. Taskforce on Critical Minerals, which aims to leverage Australia's geological resources for the benefit of the U.S. industry. Rowena Smith, CEO of ASM, believes that the Dubbo project is well-positioned to support the shared objectives of Australia and the U.S.

In summary, the collaboration between the U.S. and Australia in the search for critical metals underscores the growing importance of these resources in innovative technologies and renewable energy. These partnerships demonstrate a desire to reduce reliance on China and capitalize on investment incentives. The involvement of government agencies and major engineering firms further reinforces the commitment to developing a sustainable supply chain for critical minerals. Both countries recognize the strategic significance of these resources and are working together to secure their availability for future advancements.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660204347dcbbcbc0ad19587/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 21:27:14,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-favorite-linux-text-editors-and-why-you-should-be-using-one/,My favorite Linux text editors (and why you should be using one),"Linux has a long history of text editors, with the infamous editor wars between emacs and vi causing strong loyalty among users. However, the role of text editors has evolved over time. While they were initially used primarily for configuring Linux or writing code, they are now used for various purposes such as note-taking, journals, and even writing novels. In this article, we will explore some of the best text editors for Linux that are suitable for everyday use.

Before we dive into the list, let's address a common question: why are emacs and vi not included? While these editors are undeniably powerful, they can be overwhelming for average users. They often have a steep learning curve and can get in the way more than they help. However, if you are an experienced user looking for more advanced tools, emacs and vi are still excellent options for coding, configuring, and administering.

Now, let's move on to the text editors that are perfect for everyday use.

1. Nano
For many Linux users, nano has been the go-to text editor for decades. It may seem basic, but it gets the job done efficiently. Nano provides all the essential features you need in an editor without unnecessary complexity. It allows you to write simple flat text files without any formatting. Some of its features include interactive search-and-replace, undo/redo, syntax coloring, smooth scrolling, auto-indentation, go-to-line-and-column-number, file locking, and internationalization support.

It's important to note that nano is a terminal application, which means it doesn't have a graphical user interface. To use nano, you open the terminal and enter the command ""nano filename"" (where ""filename"" is the name of the file you want to edit or create). Nano comes pre-installed with most Linux distributions and is completely free.

2. Gedit
Gedit is the default text editor for the GNOME desktop environment. It is a simple yet effective graphical application that offers a range of features. With Gedit, you can enjoy features such as tabs, support for internationalized text (UTF-8), syntax highlighting, markdown support, configurable fonts and colors, print support, auto-save, keyboard shortcuts, theming, and full-screen mode.

What sets Gedit apart is its simplicity and ease of use. While I personally prefer nano for most tasks, Gedit is my go-to choice when I need a graphical interface. Additionally, Gedit can be used in fullscreen mode, allowing you to focus on your text without distractions. Gedit is free and comes bundled with most GNOME-based desktop distributions.

3. COSMIC Text Editor
COSMIC Text Editor is the default text editor for System76's COSMIC desktop, which will be released in the future. Although COSMIC Text Editor is still under development, it is already showing great promise. It aims to provide a similar experience to Gedit but tailored for the COSMIC desktop environment. Some of its features include syntax highlighting, standard keyboard shortcuts, find, spellcheck, project support, reverting changes, document statistics, and even Git management support.

COSMIC Text Editor stands out due to its simplicity and sleek design. It is suitable for both basic tasks and more advanced use cases, such as coding. If you are using Pop!_OS, you can get a preview of COSMIC Text Editor by installing it from the Pop Shop. COSMIC Text Editor will be available for free when the COSMIC Desktop OS is released.

4. Kate
Kate is to KDE Plasma what Gedit is to GNOME. It offers a similar set of features but with a few additional functionalities. One notable feature of Kate is multi-cursor and multi-cursor selection, which allows you to select and manipulate multiple strings of text simultaneously. Kate also provides project support, syntax highlighting, standard keyboard shortcuts, and a plugin system. With plugins, you can enhance Kate with features such as SQL query support, GDB debugging, and one-click project build.

Think of Kate as a supercharged version of Gedit that can handle creating and editing simple text files while also providing advanced capabilities. Kate is free and is the default text editor for KDE Plasma.

In conclusion, Linux offers a range of text editors suitable for everyday use. Whether you prefer a terminal-based editor like nano or a graphical editor like Gedit, there is a text editor that meets your needs. COSMIC Text Editor and Kate provide additional features and are tailored for specific desktop environments. Whichever text editor you choose, you can trust that it will help you efficiently edit and create text files on your Linux system.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/feda4ca65eefc13df0e3505780d84330ecd3c713/2024/03/25/d964a97e-9c56-444a-9497-19bc7ca26a56/typingclosegettyimages-1341060766.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/match-board-directors-after-talks-activist-investor-elliott-management/,Match appoints two board directors after talks with activist investor Elliott Management,"Tinder-owner Match Group has recently made some significant changes to its board of directors and has entered into an agreement with activist investor Elliott Management. The company has appointed Laura Jones, the Chief Marketing Officer at Instacart, and Spencer Rascoff, co-founder of Zillow, to its board. Match Group stated that these appointments were made following a productive dialogue with Elliott Management, which has acquired a stake of approximately $1 billion in the company. Elliott Management has expressed interest in helping Match improve its performance amid a decline in paying users.
Marc Steinberg, a partner at Elliott Management, emphasized the firm's belief in Match Group's potential for value creation as a global leader in online dating. He expressed confidence in the newly appointed board members, Laura Jones and Spencer Rascoff, and their ability to contribute to the company's growth in the future.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/25/google-update-warning-chrome-windows-11-android-iphone/,Google’s New AI Search Goes Horribly Wrong-M Is For Malware,"Google's new AI search feature, called Search Generative Experience (SGE), has encountered some unexpected problems. While the goal was to enhance search results with generative AI technology, it seems that the initial results have been disappointing. An SEO consultant testing the new feature discovered scams and dangerous malware within the search results. Bleeping Computer confirmed these findings, warning users about the presence of scam sites, fake iPhone giveaways, browser spam subscriptions, and tech support scams. The issue with generative AI is that these dangers are presented using friendly and engaging language, making it harder for users to identify them.

Most of the fraudulent redirects found were aimed at obtaining personal information, promoting adware, or encouraging users to sign up for unwanted subscriptions. Some of the links even led to the installation of malicious browser extensions that hijacked searches and engaged in potentially harmful activities. Google assured Bleeping Computer that they are continuously updating their spam-fighting systems to protect users from such threats. They claimed to have taken action to remove the examples shared, which only appeared for uncommon queries. Further comments from Google regarding these issues are yet to be obtained.

Although SGE was initially opt-in, it is now being expanded to a wider user base. According to 9to5Google, Google is testing AI-powered overviews on a small percentage of search traffic in certain categories, including users who are not logged into a Google account. It is important to note that the reported examples were from an opt-in Search Labs user and not from the general user base that will see the AI test results. Hopefully, by the time SGE is rolled out more widely, these issues will have been addressed.

This situation highlights the fact that AI search is the future, but users must remain cautious. As we venture into this new era, it is crucial to remember that despite the engaging language used, the usual rules of safe searching still apply. Additionally, as search becomes more integrated into generative AI chatbots, the potential for exploitation and new tricks increases. Before this happens, it is essential to improve filters and defenses to protect users from these threats.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6602155031526c87ed877205/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3115,2027,x1040,y734,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 21:15:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/25/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-upgrade-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-s23/,Apple’s Surprise Update Just Made iPhone More Like Android,"Apple’s recent AI news has caused quite a stir, and the latest rumor has reportedly been confirmed. It seems that everything has changed for the iPhone, with serious security and privacy risks to be navigated. Apple has always prided itself on being more private and secure than Android, but these differences are starting to diminish as Google strengthens its security and privacy measures and Apple makes its own concessions.

The news coming out of China is particularly interesting. According to local media, the report that Apple was discussing a generative AI deal with China's Baidu has now been confirmed. This deal has been finalized, and Chinese generative AI will soon be coming to the iPhone, but only in China.

Baidu's AI model has received approval from the Chinese government, which the company has strong links to. There were even reports suggesting military AI ties, although these were denied. This is an intriguing move for privacy-focused Apple, as it enters into an area where surveillance, monitoring, and controls are prevalent.

In China, the AI landscape is heavily regulated, with only government-approved models allowed. While the main focus of these approvals is censorship and preventing dissent, there is always the underlying context of surveillance and control. Apple has been navigating this landscape since its earliest days in China, and its growth in the country has only exacerbated the challenges.

AI is a tricky path to tread because it has the potential to rapidly expand its role in our smartphones and our lives. Determining whether to grant or deny AI access to our most sensitive information will be an ongoing challenge. Baidu, like other Chinese tech companies, is subject to the same national security laws that have been heavily debated with regards to ByteDance/TikTok, Huawei, and others.

Initially, speculation suggested that Apple's generative AI plans for iOS 18 would be on-device, with Apple designing both hardware and software to ensure privacy and security extended to the new world of AI. This would have been a logical extension of Apple's commitment to end-to-end encryption and tight user controls. But then came the news that Apple was in talks with Google about Gemini, and everything changed.

From a privacy standpoint, Google's AI is primarily cloud-based, although it does have lighter-weight on-device functionality with Nano. The idea that Apple was considering incorporating Google's technology into its iPhone surprised many. It became the tech talking point of the year, at least until the Department of Justice stepped forward.

Despite their different approaches to AI, cloud, encryption, and privacy, there was a ruthless commercial logic behind Apple's potential alliance with Google. Google is leading the way with generative AI and is far ahead when it comes to applying it to smartphones, apps, and services. This deal also paved the way for the exclusive iPhone search arrangement. Time is of the essence, and Apple needs to keep up with the competition.

This is just the latest example of iPhone and Android becoming more closely aligned. Both are adopting a mix-and-match approach, with Google's Gemini in the cloud and their own AI on-device. Samsung is also following a similar approach, balancing AI features with user privacy and data security. Samsung's hybrid approach combines on-device and cloud-based AI, giving users greater control over their data.

It seems that Apple is now contemplating a similar approach for the iPhone. AI is a revolution when integrated into phones, but it is crucial to raise the standards of security and privacy in this new era of data-intensive mobile experiences, as Samsung's TM Roh rightly pointed out. I had assumed that Apple would take a more locked-down approach with regards to on-device versus cloud AI, with privacy considerations at the forefront. It is surprising to see Apple in the same position as Samsung, and the inclusion of Chinese generative AI adds an interesting twist.

I have reached out to Apple for any further information on this matter, and I will update this article as soon as I receive a response. In the meantime, it is clear that the landscape of AI on the iPhone is changing, and Apple will need to navigate these new challenges while maintaining its commitment to privacy and security.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65aeed369be3a016e61b4a9a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 23:00:00,Innovation,Innovation

Alphabet/Google’s rules on steering in Google Play and its approach to self-preferencing in search results are in the frame. For Apple, the EU is also looking at its rules on steering in the App Store and the design of choice screens for alternatives to its Safari web browser. While Meta’s “pay or consent” model will be scrutinized by the Commission.

In total, five investigations were announced Monday — less than three weeks since the compliance deadline kicked in for the companies earlier this month.

The three gatekeepers, which were designated under the pan-EU market power and contestability regulation last fall, face formal investigation in these areas to determine whether they are breaching the rulebook, as the Commission suspects. Confirmed violations of the DMA can result in fines of up to 10% of global annual turnover, or even 20% for repeat offenses.

The EU will have up to 12 months to conclude the investigations, per recommended timeframes in the DMA. A preliminary report can be produced within six months. Although senior Commission officials noted Monday that the probes may conclude sooner or could take longer than these guidelines.

The enforcement action by the bloc comes as antitrust scrutiny continues to dial up on the three U.S. firms on home turf, too.

Since the three companies unveiled their DMA compliance plans, there has been a range of criticism that the proposals do not comply with the new EU law.

Google has been accused of seeking to avoid the regulation’s ban on self-preferencing by launching new rich features in search results that compete unfairly with rivals. While Apple’s use of notifications to users warning them of risks of stepping outside its walled garden has been attacked by developers as “scare screens”, among a number of criticisms. And Meta’s ‘pay or be tracked’ tactic has been roundly condemned as exploitative abuse by privacy and consumer rights groups. (Earlier this month, the Commission sent Meta questions about this under the DMA’s sister regulation, the Digital Services Act, too.)

“The Commission has opened proceedings to assess whether the measures implemented by Alphabet and Apple in relation to their obligations pertaining to app stores are in breach of the DMA. Article 5(4) of the DMA requires gatekeepers to allow app developers to “steer” consumers to offers outside the gatekeepers’ app stores, free of charge,” the Commission wrote, saying it’s concerned the pair’s steering measures “may not be fully compliant as they impose various restrictions and limitations”, pointing, for example, to constraints on developers’ ability to “freely communicate and promote offers and directly conclude contracts”.

On concerns about Google self-preferencing, the EU said the investigation will focus on Google’s vertical search services (e.g., Google Shopping; Google Flights; Google Hotels) and the impact its action may have on similar rival services.

“The Commission is concerned that Alphabet’s measures implemented to comply with the DMA may not ensure that third-party services featuring on Google’s search results page are treated in a fair and non-discriminatory manner in comparison with Alphabet’s own services, as required by Article 6(5) of the DMA,” it wrote.

On Apple, the EU will also look at whether it’s complying with a range of user choice obligations on iOS — including enabling end users to easily uninstall apps; easily change default settings; and prompt users with choice screens which it says “must effectively and easily allow them to select an alternative default service, such as a browser or search engine on their iPhones”.

“The Commission is concerned that Apple’s measures, including the design of the web browser choice screen, may be preventing users from truly exercising their choice of services within the Apple ecosystem, in contravention of Article 6(3) of the DMA,” it added.

On Meta, the EU said the proceedings will investigate whether its recently introduced “pay or consent” model for EU users complies with Article 5(2) of the DMA, noting that this portion of the regulation “requires gatekeepers to obtain consent from users when they intend to combine or cross-use their personal data across different core platform services”.

“The Commission is concerned that the binary choice imposed by Meta’s ‘pay or consent’ model may not provide a real alternative in case users do not consent, thereby not achieving the objective of preventing the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers,” it said.

Responding to a question about this probe during Monday’s press conference, the EU’s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, said the DMA puts a clear requirement on gatekeepers to offer a free, non","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1031626648.jpg?resize=1200,799",2024-03-25 12:10:10,Innovation,Innovation
