https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-vulnerability-virtual-reality.html,Vulnerability in virtual reality systems identified,"Virtual reality (VR) systems have opened up a whole new world of possibilities, allowing users to immerse themselves in virtual environments. However, a team of computer scientists from the University of Chicago has recently discovered a potential vulnerability in these systems that could be exploited by hackers. They have dubbed this vulnerability an ""inception layer,"" and it has the potential to compromise the security and privacy of VR users.

In their paper, which has been published on the arXiv preprint server, the researchers describe how this inception layer could be inserted between a user's VR Home Screen and their VR User/Server. Essentially, this layer acts as a simulated VR app that deceives users into thinking they are interacting with a legitimate VR application when, in fact, they are running a malicious app controlled by the attacker.

The concept behind the inception layer is inspired by the movie ""Inception,"" where a character played by Leonardo DiCaprio has an altered layer of reality downloaded into his brain. Similarly, the researchers propose that hackers could add a layer between the user and the virtual world they see through their VR device.

This inception layer could be used to record sensitive information entered by the user, such as a passcode for a virtual ATM. It could also intercept and modify information, such as changing the cash amount designated for a purchase and redirecting the difference to the hacker's bank account. Furthermore, the layer could introduce deceptive elements into the VR world, such as characters representing friends or family, in order to gain the user's trust or access to confidential information.

The implications of this vulnerability are significant, as the inception layer has the ability to monitor and manipulate various aspects of the user's VR experience. This includes gestures, voice commands, browsing activity, and social or business interactions. The potential for exploitation is alarming, as hackers could gain access to sensitive data or even manipulate the user's behavior for malicious purposes.

The researchers conducted an experiment to demonstrate the feasibility of this vulnerability. They enlisted the help of 28 volunteers who played a game using a demonstration VR headset. They then downloaded a simulated hacking app onto the devices without the volunteers' knowledge. While a slight flickering occurred during the download and activation process, only 10 of the volunteers noticed it, and only one questioned whether something suspicious was happening.

Upon discovering this vulnerability, the research team promptly notified Meta, the company behind the Meta Quest VR system used in the experiment. Meta has assured the researchers that they will investigate the issue and address it if it is confirmed. However, the researchers emphasize that similar vulnerabilities are likely to exist in other VR systems and applications that seek to insert themselves between users and their VR devices.

The potential risks posed by this vulnerability highlight the importance of ongoing research and development in the field of VR security. As the popularity of VR continues to grow, it is crucial to address and mitigate vulnerabilities to ensure the privacy and safety of users. With further investigation and collaboration between researchers, VR manufacturers, and cybersecurity experts, we can work towards a more secure and trustworthy VR experience for all.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/vulnerability-in-virtu.jpg,2024-03-25 10:20:02,Innovation,Innovation

With your personal information stored in numerous databases, criminals have ample opportunity to exploit it for their gain. They can drain your bank accounts, tarnish your credit, and even leave you with a criminal record. However, you can take steps to protect yourself and your loved ones from identity theft and bank fraud. In this article, we will explore nine tips to enable family protection and maintain your peace of mind.

1. Safeguard your personal information
Your personal information, such as your name, address, date of birth, and social security number, is a goldmine for identity thieves. To protect yourself, make sure to shred any documents containing personal information. Additionally, be cautious when sharing this information over the phone or via email to avoid falling victim to scams.

2. Strengthen your passwords
Your passwords act as the first line of defense for your online accounts. Ensure that your passwords are strong, consisting of at least eight characters with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. It is crucial not to reuse the same password for multiple accounts, as this increases the risk of compromise. Consider using a password manager to generate and store unique passwords securely.

3. Regularly monitor your accounts
Stay vigilant by regularly checking your bank and credit card statements for any unauthorized transactions. If you notice any suspicious activity, report it immediately to your bank or credit card company.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/techcrunch-mobility-the-wheels-are-starting-to-come-off-the-fisker-ev-bus/,TechCrunch Mobility: The wheels are starting to come off the Fisker EV bus,"TechCrunch Mobility is a weekly newsletter that focuses on transportation news and insights. In this edition, we discuss the recent proposed standards by the Biden Administration that will impact U.S. automakers and consumers. While these regulations have been softened, they still impose stricter standards than before. The Department of Energy (DOE) has introduced a ""petroleum equivalency factor"" that gives electric vehicles (EVs) a score under the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has also released tailpipe standards for future model year cars and trucks. These standards put more requirements on automakers but allow flexibility in meeting them through different powertrains.

For EV startups like Rivian, Tesla, and Lucid, these standards don't have a significant impact since their vehicles already meet the clean car standard. However, legacy automakers that are investing in EV development while still making profits from internal combustion engine vehicles will face challenges. Plug-in hybrids may benefit from these regulations.

In other news, Clevon, a company working on autonomous delivery technology, is struggling to find new investment but has entered into an exclusivity agreement for a merger with an American electric vehicle company. Moove, an African mobility fintech, raised $100 million in a Series B funding round led by Uber. Moove offers vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers and aligns with Uber's goal of a fully zero-emission fleet.

Additionally, Amber, a startup that offers aftermarket Tesla extended warranties, raised $3.18 million in a seed round. Candela, an electric boat maker, raised $25 million in funding led by Groupe Beneteau. Pelikan Mobility, a French startup, has developed a new electric scooter called the Pelikan Boxter.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2024/03/25/amid-fintech-slowdown-goldman-sachs-backed-startup-considers-sale-sources-say/,"Amid Fintech Slowdown, Goldman Sachs-Backed Startup Considers Sale","Deserve, a Silicon Valley startup that assists companies in launching and managing credit cards, is facing challenges amid a slowdown in business and a dry funding market. The company, which is valued at $500 million and backed by investors such as Goldman Sachs, Visa, Mastercard, and Accel, has reportedly explored the possibility of selling itself due to these difficulties. However, Deserve's founder and CEO, Kalpesh Kapadia, has stated that the company is not for sale and is instead focused on strategic discussions regarding partnerships, investments, and mergers and acquisitions.

Despite raising $150 million in equity funding since its founding in 2013, Deserve has not yet achieved profitability and is said to have burned through $15 million to $20 million in 2023. Kapadia remains optimistic about the company's future, anticipating strong growth in the coming year and positioning Deserve as a self-sustaining, profitable business. However, industry insiders predict that if Deserve were to be sold, its valuation would likely be less than half of its peak value in 2021.

Deserve faced a unique challenge in 2021 when its largest customer, crypto lender BlockFi, filed for bankruptcy. Deserve had been working with BlockFi to issue credit cards, but the collapse of the crypto company significantly impacted Deserve's revenue. Despite this setback, Deserve has continued to serve other customers, including fintech companies and banks.

Deserve was originally established as a consumer credit card company targeting underserved populations such as immigrants and students. However, consumer lending proved to be a challenging and capital-intensive business, prompting a pivot in 2018. Deserve began assisting other companies, such as Sallie Mae, in launching their own credit cards. This shift allowed Deserve to streamline the credit card launch process for its customers, handling tasks such as risk assessment, transaction processing, customer service, and dispute resolution.

While Deserve has faced setbacks due to the changing fintech landscape and the struggles of its customers, it remains a player in the tech-enabled credit card issuing industry. The company serves a diverse range of customers, including fintech startups like M1 and traditional banks like Customers Bank. Competition in this space has intensified, but Deserve continues to adapt and seek opportunities for growth.

In conclusion, Deserve, a fintech startup specializing in credit card launch and management, is navigating challenges in a slowing business and funding market. Despite considering the possibility of selling the company, Deserve remains committed to its strategic discussions and aims to achieve profitability in the near future. While setbacks, such as the bankruptcy of its largest customer, have impacted Deserve's revenue, the company continues to serve a diverse customer base and adapt to the evolving fintech landscape.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600d053afe6bed0f9b925c9/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 11:57:06,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-household-robots-common.html,Engineering household robots to have a little common sense,"From wiping spills to serving food, robots are increasingly being trained to perform complex household tasks. These robots learn through imitation, copying the motions that a human physically guides them through. However, if robots are not programmed to handle unexpected situations, they may struggle to complete their tasks. MIT engineers have developed a method that allows robots to adjust and adapt to disruptions within a task, without starting from scratch or requiring explicit programming for every failure.

The engineers have connected robot motion data with the ""common sense knowledge"" of large language models (LLMs). This approach enables robots to break down household tasks into subtasks and adjust to disruptions within those subtasks. By connecting robot motion data with language models, robots can self-correct errors and improve overall task success.

Imitation learning is a common approach used to train household robots. However, blindly mimicking a human's motion trajectories can lead to small errors that accumulate and derail the execution of the task. With the new method developed by the MIT engineers, robots can self-correct execution errors and improve their overall success rate.

The researchers illustrate their approach using the example of scooping marbles from one bowl and pouring them into another. Traditionally, engineers would demonstrate the task to the robot by moving it through the motions of scooping and pouring. However, the team realized that a task consists of a sequence of subtasks. For example, before scooping, the robot needs to reach into the bowl, and after scooping, it needs to move to the empty bowl. If a robot makes a mistake during any of these subtasks, it would typically have to start from the beginning. The MIT researchers wanted to enable robots to self-correct in the moment without the need for explicit labeling and programming of each subtask.

To automate this process, the researchers turned to large language models (LLMs). These deep learning models process extensive libraries of text and can generate new sentences based on what they have learned. The researchers found that LLMs can be prompted to produce a logical list of subtasks for a given task. By connecting the LLM's natural language labels for subtasks with the robot's position in physical space or an image of the robot state, the researchers were able to create an algorithm that maps the robot's physical coordinates to the natural language labels.

This algorithm allows the robot to know what stage it is in a task and enables it to replan and recover on its own. The researchers believe that this approach can greatly improve the capabilities of household robots and make them more adaptable to real-world situations.

In conclusion, MIT engineers have developed a method that connects robot motion data with language models to enable robots to adjust and adapt during tasks. By breaking down tasks into subtasks and connecting them with natural language labels, robots can self-correct errors and improve overall task success. This approach eliminates the need for explicit programming of every failure scenario and allows robots to handle disruptions without starting from scratch. The researchers believe that this method can greatly enhance the capabilities of household robots and improve their performance in real-world environments.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/engineering-household.jpg,2024-03-25 09:48:20,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-strategy-suppress-strain-propagation-ultrahigh.html,A strategy to suppress strain propagation in ultrahigh-Ni cathodes during fast charging,"To meet the increasing demand for advanced battery technologies in the electronics industry and support the widespread adoption of electric vehicles, researchers are exploring new approaches to enhance the performance of lithium-ion batteries (LiBs). One promising strategy involves the use of nickel (Ni)-rich layered oxides as cathode materials.

Ni-rich cathodes offer several advantages, such as increased battery capacity, improved rate capabilities, and reduced fabrication costs. However, they also have limitations, including capacity degradation and structural instability during fast-charging and long-term cycling.

To address these challenges, a team of researchers from Argonne National Laboratory and other institutes worldwide has developed a novel strategy to improve the structural stability and reliability of ultrahigh-Ni cathodes. Their approach, described in a recent paper published in Nature Energy, involves the use of epitaxial entropy-assisted oxide coating to suppress strain propagation, which is a common cause of cathode failure during battery charging and cycling.

The researchers explain that surface reconstruction and strain propagation have long been recognized as major factors contributing to cathode failure. Despite numerous attempts, existing strategies have not been able to simultaneously address the electro-chemomechanical instability without sacrificing energy and power density.

In their study, the team reports on an epitaxial entropy-assisted coating strategy for ultrahigh-Ni cathodes. They achieved this by designing a specialized oxide coating that aligns with the structure of Ni-rich cathodes. These coatings not only enhance the surface robustness of the cathode materials but also improve ionic conductivity, enabling faster charging of batteries.

The coating is based on Wadsley-Roth crystallographic shear phases, which have been found to enhance electrode performance in LiBs. Importantly, these compounds adhere well to Ni-rich cathodes, thereby strengthening their structural stability during prolonged operation and fast-charging.

The researchers conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of their coating strategy. They coated Ni-rich layered cathodes and tested their performance over time and under various conditions. The results were highly promising, as the coating significantly reduced damage to the cathodes, even during fast-charging and after multiple operation cycles.

The team believes that their epitaxial entropy-assisted coating strategy opens up new opportunities for surface engineering in the design and development of high-energy and high-power LiBs and beyond.

In conclusion, researchers have introduced a novel approach to enhance the structural stability and performance of ultrahigh-Ni cathodes in LiBs. Their epitaxial entropy-assisted coating strategy effectively suppresses strain propagation and improves the fast-charging capability, temperature tolerance, and thermal stability of the cathodes. The findings of this study offer new insights into the design and development of advanced battery technologies for various applications.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/a-strategy-to-suppress.jpg,2024-03-25 09:40:01,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/03/25/cyberpunk-2077-will-be-free-to-play-for-a-bit-heres-how-to-get-it/,"‘Cyberpunk 2077’ Will Be Free To Play For A Bit, Here’s How To Get It","CD Projekt Red (CDPR) is making a bold move to ensure that as many people as possible get the chance to experience the highly anticipated game, Cyberpunk 2077.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/25/in-photos-worm-moon-lunar-eclipse-sets-up-total-solar-eclipse/,In Photos: ‘Worm Moon Lunar Eclipse’ Sets Up Total Solar Eclipse,"March's full moon, known as the ""Worm Moon,"" graced the night sky on Sunday and was partially eclipsed for nearly five hours into Monday in certain parts of the world. This lunar spectacle sets the stage for a total solar eclipse in North America on the following new moon, which falls on Monday, April 8.

The third full moon of 2024, and the first of spring in the northern hemisphere, was a sight to behold for people across the globe. However, the partial lunar eclipse could only be witnessed from the night side of the Earth at the appropriate time. Regions such as North and South America, Europe, East Asia, Australia, and New Zealand were fortunate enough to catch a glimpse.

During the lunar eclipse, Earth cast its shadow on the moon, creating a mesmerizing celestial phenomenon. A lunar eclipse can only occur during a full moon when the moon is on the opposite side of the Earth from the sun.

On Monday morning, sky gazers were treated to a penumbral lunar eclipse. In space, Earth has two shadows - the dark umbra and the outer penumbra. During this eclipse, the moon passed through the penumbra only, and the entire journey lasted precisely 4 hours and 39 minutes. Let's take a closer look at this captivating event.

As the moon traveled through the penumbra, Earth's enormous shadow gradually swept across its surface, causing a dimming effect on the sunlight. This is different from a ""Blood Moon,"" where the moon passes through the umbra and takes on a reddish hue due to the refraction of sunlight by Earth's atmosphere.

During this penumbral lunar eclipse, the moon was positioned against the backdrop of the stars in the constellation Virgo. Spica, the brightest star in Virgo, appeared to the moon's lower left, while Antares, the brightest star in Scorpius, shone high to its upper right. Over the next two nights, the moon would move closer to Spica, making for a stunning celestial display.

Just like any full moon, the ""Worm Moon"" was visible throughout the night. It rose in the east at sunset and set in the west at sunrise. This particular full moon earned its name due to the emergence of beetle larvae from the thawing bark of trees, a natural occurrence during spring.

The upcoming new moon on April 8 is highly anticipated. Not only is it a ""supermoon,"" meaning it will appear larger than usual, but it will also cause a partial solar eclipse visible in North America. This total solar eclipse is expected to last an impressive 4 minutes and 26 seconds. However, it will only be visible within a narrow path of totality, spanning approximately 115 miles. 

This path will stretch from the Pacific coast of northwestern Mexico to Atlantic Canada, passing through 15 U.S. states, including Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. People outside this path will still be able to witness a partial solar eclipse.

It is a rare occurrence for a total solar eclipse to take place, happening only once every 366 years on average. However, North America has the privilege of experiencing two total solar eclipses in just seven years, with the previous one occurring on August 21, 2017.

Following the ""Worm Moon"" and the total solar eclipse, the next full moon to grace the night sky will be the ""Pink Moon"" on Tuesday, April 23, at 23:48 UTC/7:48 p.m. EDT. This will be the fourth full moon of 2024, promising another enchanting celestial event.

May your eyes be filled with wonder and your skies be clear as you witness these extraordinary celestial phenomena.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6601aa9bc397763ceaf0c79a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1566,881,x217,y217,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 12:57:41,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/lucid-motors-1-billion-saudi-arabia-gravity-suv/,Lucid Motors raises another $1 billion from Saudi Arabia as it searches for luxury EV buyers,"Lucid Motors, the luxury electric sedan manufacturer, has secured an additional $1 billion investment from its major financial backer, Saudi Arabia. The funding from Ayar Third Investment, an affiliate of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, will increase the Kingdom's ownership stake to around 60%. This injection of capital will help Lucid offset the high costs of producing and selling its electric vehicles.

In a recent regulatory filing, Lucid revealed that it plans to manufacture approximately 9,000 units of its Air electric vehicles in the current year, a slight increase compared to last year's production. However, the company suffered significant losses of $2.8 billion in 2023 and ended the year with just under $1.4 billion in cash and equivalents. To boost sales, Lucid has resorted to slashing prices on its expensive Air sedan multiple times in recent months. Additionally, the company intends to commence production of its electric Gravity SUV by the end of this year.

Interestingly, Lucid's announcement of the investment comes shortly after CEO Peter Rawlinson expressed caution about relying too heavily on Saudi Arabia for funding. Rawlinson emphasized the importance of not assuming there is unlimited financial support from the Public Investment Fund and acknowledged the respect he has for the Kingdom.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/webroot/2024/03/25/7-cyber-safety-tips-to-outsmart-scammers/,7 Cyber Safety Tips To Outsmart Scammers,"Welcome to the wild west of the digital world, where cyber scammers lurk around every corner. Cybercrime is not just a Hollywood plotline; it is a real threat that targets individuals of all ages. In this article, we will explore the rising tide of cybercrime and provide you with seven essential tips to stay safe online.

Before we delve into the tips, let's equip ourselves with the ultimate weapon: knowledge. Scams are the digital equivalent of snake oil salespeople peddling miracle cures. They come in all shapes and sizes, lurking in the shadowy corners of the internet. The golden rule of scam detection is skepticism. Approach any promise of untold riches, once-in-a-lifetime opportunities, or free Caribbean cruises with caution and a healthy dose of skepticism.

Now, let's take a quick tour through the terrain of common cyber scams:

1. Phishing scams: Ah, phishing scams, the bane of our digital existence. These sneaky scams involve fake emails posing as messages from familiar faces or reputable companies. They attempt to sweet-talk you into clicking on suspicious links or divulging sensitive information like passwords or credit card details. Remember, real companies don't ask for your personal data via email.

2. Sweepstakes and awards scams: Congratulations! You've just won a brand new car, a tropical vacation, and a lifetime supply of unicorn-shaped cookies. All you need to do is pay a small processing fee. Sound too good to be true? That's because it is! These scams offer you instant wealth but are clever ruses to empty your wallet faster than you can say ""jackpot.""

3. Investment scams: Picture this: a golden opportunity to double your money with zero risk. Investment scams lure unsuspecting victims with the promise of sky-high profits. Don't let these offers cloud your judgment. Always do your due diligence before investing your hard-earned cash.

4. Lawsuit or tax scams: Lawsuit and tax scams thrive on instilling fear and panic, claiming you owe urgent payments. When in doubt, verify the legitimacy of any claims before reaching for your wallet.

5. Romance scams: Romance scams prey on the trusting hearts of hopeful romantics, weaving elaborate tales of love and devotion before swooping in for the financial kill. Remember, anyone who asks for money online is more likely to break your heart than mend it.

6. Tech support scams: These imposters offer remote assistance to fix nonexistent problems with your laptop or devices while gaining access to your sensitive data. Remember, legitimate tech support doesn't come knocking unsolicited. If in doubt, just delete the email and seek help from trusted sources.

Armed with this knowledge, you are ready to navigate the digital minefield with confidence. Remember to be a good internet citizen by forwarding any scams you encounter to the U.S. government's Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) at phishing-report@us-cert.gov.

Now, let's move on to the seven essential tips to stay safe online:

1. Use strong passwords: Your password is the digital key to your castle, so make sure it's not something as flimsy as '123456' or 'password.' Get creative! Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters like a mad scientist concocting a secret potion. And don't reuse passwords across multiple accounts unless you want to throw a welcome party for cybercriminals.

2. Enable two-factor authentication: Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts. It requires you to provide a secondary form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password. This way, even if someone guesses or steals your password, they won't be able to access your account without the second factor.

3. Keep your software up to date: Software updates often include security patches that protect against known vulnerabilities. Make sure to regularly update your operating system, web browsers, and other software to stay one step ahead of cybercriminals.

4. Be cautious of public Wi-Fi: Public Wi-Fi networks are convenient, but they can be a playground for hackers. Avoid accessing sensitive information, such as online banking or shopping, while connected to public Wi-Fi. If you must use public Wi-Fi, consider using a virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt your internet connection and protect your data.

5. Think before you click: Before clicking on a link or downloading an attachment, pause and consider its source. Is it from a trusted sender? Does it look suspicious or out of the ordinary? Hover over links to see the URL before clicking on them. When in doubt, don't click.

6. Be mindful of what you share online: Think twice before sharing personal information on social media or other online platforms. Cybercriminals can use this information to impersonate you or guess your passwords. Keep your private life private and limit the amount of personal information you share online.

7. Educate yourself and your loved ones: Cybersecurity is everyone's responsibility. Stay informed about the latest threats and teach your family and friends how to stay safe online. By spreading awareness, you can help create a safer digital environment for everyone.

In conclusion, the digital world can be a dangerous place, but with the right knowledge and precautions, you can navigate it safely. Stay vigilant, be skeptical of suspicious offers, and follow these seven essential tips to protect yourself from cyber scams. Remember, your online safety is in your hands. Stay safe out there!",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ea0ea426a7cb96ff0f5cde/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 11:48:40,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/match-board-directors-after-talks-activist-investor-elliott-management/,Match appoints two board directors after talks with activist investor Elliott Management,"Tinder-owner Match Group has made some significant moves recently, with the appointment of two new board members and the signing of an agreement with Elliott Management. Laura Jones, the Chief Marketing Officer at Instacart, and Spencer Rascoff, co-founder of Zillow, have joined Match Group's board with immediate effect. This comes after a period of ""constructive dialogue"" with Elliott Management, an activist investor that has reportedly invested around $1 billion in Match Group.

The Wall Street Journal previously reported that Elliott Management was interested in helping Match Group improve its performance, particularly in light of a decline in paying users amid economic uncertainty. The company has faced challenges in maintaining its growth trajectory, with a 5% decrease in total paid users in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the previous year. This decline has been attributed to the company's slower growth following the peak it reached during the COVID-19 pandemic. Match Group's stock has also experienced a significant decline of 79% from its 2021 peak.

Elliott Management is known for its activism in the tech sector, often pushing for changes within companies it invests in. Match Group is the parent company of several popular dating apps, including Tinder, Hinge, Match.com, Meetic, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, and OurTime. With the addition of Laura Jones and Spencer Rascoff to its board, Match Group aims to leverage their unique skills and perspectives to support the company's growth in its next phase.

Marc Steinberg, a partner at Elliott Management, expressed confidence in Match Group's potential for value creation as the global leader in online dating. He also highlighted the collaboration with management and the board over the past few months. The appointment of Jones and Rascoff reflects Elliott Management's belief that their expertise will contribute to Match Group's growth in the future.

This strategic move by Match Group showcases the company's commitment to adapting to changing market dynamics and ensuring it remains at the forefront of the online dating industry. With the expertise of its new board members and the support of Elliott Management, Match Group is poised to navigate the challenges ahead and continue its mission of connecting people in the digital age.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1241790742.jpeg?w=1024,2024-03-25 14:15:04,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelicamarideoliveira/2024/03/25/felipe-meneses-is-the-first-brazilian-thiel-fellow/,Felipe Meneses Is The First Brazilian Thiel Fellow,"Felipe Meneses, a Brazilian tech entrepreneur, has made history by becoming the first Latin Thiel Fellow. The Thiel Fellowship, established by billionaire Peter Thiel in 2011, awards $100,000 to individuals who choose to forego college and start their own companies. This year, Meneses, a 23-year-old from the northeastern state of Sergipe, has been selected to participate in the two-year acceleration program.

Meneses dropped out of Stanford University to pursue his entrepreneurial dreams. He co-founded Hyperplane in 2022 alongside Felipe Lamounier, Daniel Silva, and Rohan Ramanath. Hyperplane is a data intelligence firm that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to assist banks in utilizing their data to enhance the customer experience through hyper-personalization.

While Hyperplane is headquartered in Silicon Valley, it initially launched in Brazil and has secured contracts with 12 of the country's leading financial institutions. The company has already received 30 million reais ($6 million) in investments from prominent backers such as Lachy Groom, SV Angel, Clocktower Technology Ventures, Liquid2 Ventures, Soma Capital, Latitud, Atman Capital, Crestone VC, and Norte. Additionally, Hyperplane has been chosen to participate in Endeavor's Scale-UP acceleration program in the first half of 2024.

Meneses's achievement as the only Latin American founder in the Thiel Fellowship this year is noteworthy. In 2023, there were no entrepreneurs from the region on the list either. However, in 2022, Latin names did make an appearance. Ian Lee, founder of Chile-based healthtech Examedi, was among the Thiel Fellows that year. Examedi facilitates patient access to healthcare by connecting them with available healthcare providers. Another Latin founder from the 2022 cohort is Tamara Chaya Romo, a Mexican entrepreneur leading MEDU, a company focused on developing reusable personal protective equipment.

Through the Thiel Fellowship, Meneses and other talented young entrepreneurs are given a unique opportunity to pursue their innovative ideas and build successful businesses without the traditional path of higher education. This initiative not only supports the entrepreneurial spirit but also highlights the potential for global talent to thrive and make a significant impact in the tech industry.

Meneses's journey from dropping out of college to becoming a Thiel Fellow showcases the power of determination and the ability to seize exceptional opportunities. As he embarks on this two-year acceleration program, his experience and success are sure to inspire other aspiring entrepreneurs, particularly those from Latin America, to pursue their dreams and make a name for themselves in the tech world.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66019447ce2364c0c92ae041/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 11:13:47,Innovation,Innovation
