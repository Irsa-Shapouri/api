Noisy audio recordings can be a headache for audio engineers, but a German startup called AI-coustics is aiming to solve that problem using generative AI technology. With €1.9 million in funding, AI-coustics has emerged from stealth mode and is ready to enhance the clarity of voices in videos like never before.

According to Fabian Seipel, co-founder and CEO of AI-coustics, their technology goes beyond standard noise suppression. It works seamlessly across any device and speaker, making every digital interaction, whether it's a conference call, consumer device, or casual social media video, as clear as a broadcast from a professional studio.

Seipel, an audio engineer, teamed up with Corvin Jaedicke, a machine learning lecturer at the Technical University of Berlin, to establish AI-coustics in 2021. Their motivation came from personal experiences with poor audio quality in online courses and tutorials during their studies at TU Berlin.

They were determined to overcome the challenge of subpar audio quality in digital communications. Seipel, who has slight hearing impairment from his early days in music production, struggled with online content and lectures. This led them to focus on improving speech quality and intelligibility.

The market for AI-powered noise-suppressing and voice-enhancing software is already quite robust. AI-coustics faces competition from companies like Insoundz, which uses generative AI to enhance streamed and pre-recorded speech clips, and Veed.io, a video editing suite with tools to remove background noise from clips.

However, AI-coustics claims to have a unique approach to developing the AI mechanisms that reduce noise. They use a model trained on speech samples recorded in their Berlin studio. People are paid to contribute these samples, which are then added to the training data set for AI-coustics' noise-reducing model. During the training process, they simulate various audio artifacts and problems to improve the model's performance.

While AI-coustics' compensation scheme for creators may be a point of contention, it is crucial to address biases in speech recognition algorithms. These biases can harm users, as studies have shown. To combat this, AI-coustics focuses on recruiting ""diverse"" speech sample contributors to eliminate bias and ensure the technology works for all languages, speaker identities, ages, accents, and genders.

To put AI-coustics to the test, I uploaded three video clips to their platform: an interview with an 18th-century farmer, a car driving demo, and an Israel-Palestine conflict protest. AI-coustics delivered on its promise of boosting clarity. The processed clips had significantly less ambient background noise, making the speakers more audible.

Seipel envisions AI-coustics' technology being used for real-time speech enhancement, as well as embedded in devices like soundbars, smartphones, and headphones to automatically enhance voice clarity. Currently, AI-coustics offers a web app and API for post-processing audio and video recordings, as well as an SDK for integrating their platform into existing workflows, apps, and hardware.

AI-coustics has already gained traction with five enterprise customers and 20,000 users. They generate revenue through subscriptions, on-demand pricing, and licensing. Their roadmap includes expanding the team and improving the underlying speech-enhancing model.

With their innovative approach and commitment to improving audio quality, AI-coustics is set to revolutionize the way we experience digital communication. Say goodbye to noisy audio and hello to crystal-clear voices, thanks to the power of generative AI.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1009979808.jpg?resize=1200,801",2024-03-25 18:43:01,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/uzbekistan-unicorn-uzum-series-a-funding/,Meet Uzbekistan's first unicorn: e-commerce startup Uzum,"Uzum, an e-commerce startup in Uzbekistan, has recently secured $114 million in funding, making it the country's first unicorn with a valuation of $1.16 billion. With a young population and high internet and smartphone penetration rates, Uzbekistan is an ideal market for startups. In 2020, there were nearly 1,200 startups in the country, with fintech and e-commerce being the dominant sectors.

Despite the potential, e-commerce services in Uzbekistan have been lacking, accounting for only 2.2% of the total retail market. Uzum's co-founder and CEO, Djasur Djumaev, recognized this gap and saw an opportunity to create a cohesive marketplace that offers end-to-end logistics and delivery, similar to what Amazon has done in other countries. Uzum launched its marketplace in October 2022 and has quickly gained traction, with over 8 million monthly active users and more than 9,000 merchants.

In addition to its e-commerce platform, Uzum has also expanded into fintech and food delivery. The startup introduced a buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) product, which accounts for 45% to 50% of its e-commerce transactions. Uzum has also set up a digital bank to further support its growth. By attracting customers through e-commerce, Uzum is able to retain them through high-transaction businesses like daily banking and monetize them through lending and credit products.

To fuel its expansion, Uzum recently raised $114 million in a Series A funding round. The funding, led by FinSight Ventures, will be used to further develop its fintech business and enhance its e-commerce infrastructure. Uzum plans to launch new products for unsecured lending and invest in its IT and logistics infrastructure. The startup also has plans to raise $200 million in a Series B round later this year.

By the end of 2023, Uzum aims to consolidate all its businesses into two super apps, one for consumer-focused offerings and another for business-focused products. The startup also plans to launch the country's largest logistics complex for e-commerce and expand its gross merchandise value (GMV) by 150% to 200%. Uzum also intends to grow its credit portfolio and increase the total payment volume circulated through its ecosystem.

Uzum's success has been attributed to its unique position in the market, allowing it to enjoy different margins across products and make higher margins by combining its e-commerce and fintech services. With the necessary talent, resources, and products, Uzum is well-positioned to become a national tech leader in Uzbekistan.

In conclusion, Uzum's recent funding round and plans for expansion demonstrate the potential for growth in the e-commerce and fintech sectors in Uzbekistan. With a young population and high levels of internet and smartphone penetration, the country is ripe for startups to thrive. Uzum's success in creating a cohesive marketplace and expanding into fintech and food delivery positions it as a leader in the market, with plans to further solidify its position through new products and infrastructure development.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/uzum-logistics.jpg?w=1200,2024-03-26 05:00:18,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/elon-musk-x-ccdh-california-lawsuit-dismissed/,A judge just killed Elon Musk's lawsuit against an anti-hate research org,"A federal judge has ruled against Elon Musk and X in a lawsuit filed against the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), a nonprofit organization that researches online hate. The lawsuit, which accused the CCDH of spreading misleading claims and causing financial losses for X, was dismissed by the judge.

X, along with Elon Musk, also alleged that the CCDH had illegally scraped data and violated platform rules by using a third-party social media monitoring tool. Musk personally directed the lawsuit and referred to the CCDH as an ""evil propaganda machine"" in his replies.

Last year, the CCDH filed a motion to strike X's claims under California's Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (SLAPP) law, which aims to prevent frivolous lawsuits intended to intimidate. The organization accused Musk of deliberately prolonging the legal process to increase their legal costs.

United States district judge Charles R. Breyer granted the CCDH's motion to dismiss the case and denied Musk and X the opportunity to relitigate. Judge Breyer stated that the purpose of X's lawsuit was to punish the CCDH for criticizing X and possibly discourage others from engaging in such criticism.

In recent months, the CCDH has drawn attention to the rise of hate speech on Twitter following Elon Musk's increased activity on the platform. The organization published reports on how Musk's decision to unban extremist accounts could potentially boost the company's ad revenue. This included the infamous neo-Nazi Andrew Anglin, who founded the white supremacist website the Daily Stormer.

The CCDH, established in 2018, conducts research on hate speech, extremism, and misinformation on major social networks. Their research often exposes disturbing content across platforms, such as eating disorder content on TikTok, climate denial on YouTube, and violent misogynistic threats on Instagram.

Following the court ruling, CCDH CEO Imran Ahmed expressed the organization's commitment to holding social media companies accountable for their decisions. He stated that the ruling affirmed their right to research, speak, and advocate for fundamental human rights and civil liberties.

The CCDH's legal team, led by Roberta Kaplan, celebrated the decision, emphasizing that even the world's wealthiest individuals cannot bend the rule of law to their will. Kaplan had recently achieved a significant victory against former president Donald Trump in the E. Jean Carroll defamation suit.

While the CCDH celebrates its victory in California, Elon Musk continues his legal battle against the left-leaning media watchdog Media Matters for America. However, this lawsuit is filed in Texas, which lacks the same protections against frivolous lawsuits as California, potentially making it a more challenging case for Musk and X.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/twitter-x-logo-musk-pattern.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-25 20:33:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/03/25/3-motivations-behind-cosplaying-according-to-a-psychologist/,"3 Motivations Behind ‘Cosplaying,’ According To A Psychologist","Cosplay: Embracing Self-Expression and Escaping Reality

Have you ever experienced the thrill of dressing up as your favorite character on Halloween? If so, you may have gotten a taste of the excitement that comes with embodying a fictional persona, if only for a single night. However, for some individuals, this goes beyond a once-a-year event. They are part of a vibrant subculture known as cosplay, where donning elaborate costumes and immersing themselves in fictional worlds is a regular passion and art form.

Cosplaying involves dressing up as characters from various forms of media, including comic books, anime, manga, video games, movies, and television shows. It offers enthusiasts the opportunity to fully immerse themselves in the worlds of their favorite media franchises. From Superman and Batman to characters from Disney, Harry Potter, and Star Wars, the possibilities are endless. Anime and manga also provide rich source material, with popular choices including Naruto Uzumaki, Goku, Sailor Moon, and Luffy.

True cosplayers go above and beyond simply wearing the costumes. They meticulously recreate the hairstyles, makeup, and accessories of their chosen characters, striving for accuracy and authenticity. Cosplaying is not just about the appearance; it also involves embodying the personality, mannerisms, and unique traits of the character being portrayed.

So, why do people cosplay? According to research, there are three main reasons behind this passionate hobby.

1. Creative Self-Expression: Cosplaying allows individuals to express their creativity and celebrate their favorite fandoms. It provides an outlet for authentic self-expression, which has been shown to be associated with greater life satisfaction. Many cosplayers view it as a means of exploring different facets of their identity. By embodying different characters, they can experiment with various personas and aspects of themselves that they may not feel comfortable expressing in their everyday lives.

A study published in the journal Fashion Theory in 2015 examined the cosplay subculture in Hong Kong and found that the ability to shift identities plays a key role in pursuing cosplay. It allows enthusiasts to create an exciting, extraordinary, and contented self. Cosplaying offers a form of role and identity transformation, allowing individuals to become superheroes, performers, and even recapture a sense of childhood innocence. It is an empowering activity that boosts confidence by allowing individuals to choose their identity and take on new roles.

2. Escaping Reality: In a world often filled with stress and uncertainty, cosplaying offers a temporary reprieve from reality. Stepping into the shoes of a beloved character allows cosplayers to transcend the confines of their everyday lives and be anyone or anything they desire. A 2018 study found that one of the strongest motivations behind engaging in cosplay is the desire to escape from everyday life. By immersing themselves in their favorite fantastical worlds, cosplayers can experience a sense of adventure, excitement, wonder, and popularity that may be lacking in their otherwise mundane routines.

Cosplaying provides young people with dreams, pleasures, romances, and fantasies that cannot be fulfilled in their daily lives. It offers a chance to feel like a star or celebrity, even if only for a short moment. Many cosplayers admit that it is not just a hobby they love, but also a form of performance and exhibition. They want to be recognized, photographed, and admired for their dedication and creativity.

3. A Sense of Community: Apart from the ability to escape reality, a strong motivation behind cosplaying is the sense of belongingness it fosters. Cosplay creates a community among like-minded individuals, fulfilling the fundamental human need to belong. Conventions and gatherings serve as communal spaces where cosplayers can come together to share their passion and forge lasting friendships. The acceptance and understanding they find within the cosplay community are invaluable, allowing them to connect with others who share their love for the art form.

In conclusion, cosplay is far more than just dressing up in costumes. It is a form of self-expression, a means of escaping reality, and a way to find a sense of community. Through cosplay, individuals can explore different facets of their identity, experience the thrill of becoming their favorite characters, and connect with like-minded enthusiasts. It offers a unique opportunity to celebrate fandoms and immerse oneself in the worlds of beloved media franchises. So, the next time you see someone cosplaying, remember that they are not just wearing a costume – they are embracing their passion and becoming the best version of themselves by becoming someone else.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6601ac3a0b7231e5ced958f7/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2613,1224,x0,y80,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 19:30:41,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/25/google-update-warning-chrome-windows-11-android-iphone/,Google’s New AI Search Goes Horribly Wrong-M Is For Malware,"Be cautious when using Google's new AI search, as it seems to have encountered some unexpected problems. While the transition from traditional search to AI search is eagerly awaited, the initial update has not delivered what was anticipated and has instead brought about some concerning issues.

Google aims to enhance search with generative AI and has introduced its Search Generative Experience (SGE) to offer users a glimpse into how this more advanced and contextual mechanism will transform search results. However, last week, an SEO consultant discovered obvious scams within the results while exploring the new technology. Bleeping Computer verified these findings and warned that the AI-powered SGE algorithms recommended scam sites that redirected visitors to unwanted Chrome extensions, fake iPhone giveaways, browser spam subscriptions, and tech support scams.

The problem with generative AI lies in the fact that these dangers are disguised in friendly and conversational language, catching users off guard. The majority of the fraudulent redirects seemed to target personal information, adware, or unwanted subscriptions to earn commission payments. Some of the links were even more perilous, promoting unwanted browser extensions that perform search hijacking and potentially engage in other malicious activities.

Google assured Bleeping Computer that it continues to update its advanced spam-fighting systems to prevent spam from appearing in search results. The company also stated that it has taken action to remove the examples shared, which were appearing for uncommon queries. Further comments from Google regarding these issues are currently being sought.

Although SGE has been an opt-in feature until now, it is expanding its reach. According to reports from 9to5Google, Google is starting to display SGE AI-powered overviews to users who haven't signed up for it. The test is being conducted on a small percentage of search traffic within certain categories, limited to users in the United States who are not logged into a Google account.

It is important to note that the examples provided were from an opt-in Search Labs user and not from a more general user experiencing AI test results. Hopefully, by the time this feature is widely released, any such issues will have been addressed.

The broader concern is that this introduces an entirely new threat landscape that can be exploited with new tricks, targeting an audience that is not yet knowledgeable about these threats. Despite these initial challenges, it is evident that AI search is the future. However, users must exercise caution when venturing into this new territory and remember that, despite the friendly language, all the usual rules of safe searching still apply.

These problems will only intensify as search becomes more integrated into generative AI chatbots, without the ability to view search results directly. Before that happens, significant improvements must be made to the filters and defenses to ensure user safety.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6602155031526c87ed877205/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3115,2027,x1040,y734,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 21:15:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/london-regtech-gss-raises-47m-to-help-banks-screen-for-global-sanctions/,London regtech GSS raises $47M to help banks screen for global sanctions,"Global Screening Services (GSS), a London-based regulatory compliance platform, has successfully raised $47 million in funding. The increase in economic sanctions, particularly from the U.S., against countries like Russia, China, and Iran, has led to a greater demand for services that assist financial institutions in meeting their global sanctions obligations.

GSS was founded by Tom Scampion, who previously served as the head of financial crime for Deloitte's EMEA arm. In 2020, Scampion became a general partner at consulting firm AlixPartner, where GSS was initially incubated before becoming an independent entity in 2021. Last year, GSS secured funding from prominent investors, including Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). In its latest funding round, the company has attracted support from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), along with Cynosure Group and AlixPartner.

Financial institutions often find themselves at the forefront of sanctions enforcement due to their role in overseeing global financial transactions. However, identifying the parties involved in these transactions can be challenging. In the past, banks such as Standard Chartered and BNP Paribas have faced significant fines for breaching sanctions and lacking adequate money-laundering controls.

As a result, investors have shown increasing interest in regulatory compliance businesses. Companies like Droit and SteelEye have also secured substantial funding to support their operations. GSS offers a sanctions-screening platform that assists banks and other financial institutions in complying with regulations. By inputting transaction data into GSS's cloud-based platform, these institutions can receive alerts if any matches are found against standardized sanctions lists from around the world. GSS also enriches these lists with additional data points, such as dates of birth and International Maritime Organization (IMO) numbers for ships. The company also provides enhanced lists for screening, which include companies partially owned by sanctioned entities.

With the recent funding, GSS is now transitioning from the development phase to becoming fully operational. The company is preparing to launch its services for its first set of customers.

In conclusion, GSS has successfully raised $47 million in funding to support its regulatory compliance platform. As economic sanctions increase, financial institutions require tools and services to meet their global sanctions obligations. GSS aims to address this need by providing a sanctions-screening platform that assists banks and other financial institutions in complying with regulations. With its latest round of funding, GSS is gearing up to go live with its services and serve its initial set of customers.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1770041999-e1711386339681.jpg?resize=1200,677",2024-03-25 18:36:37,Innovation,Innovation
