But before we dive into that, I have a confession to make. I've always wanted to make rabbit pot pies for Easter. The combination of the savory dish with the sweet irony seems too good to pass up. Maybe one day I'll give it a try. But for now, let's focus on Wordle.

If you're not familiar with Wordle, it's a fun word puzzle game that I've been writing about for a few weeks now. If you're interested, you can check out my latest Strands guide on it. But let's get down to business and solve today's Wordle puzzle.

The hint for today is ""Useful when dry, useless when wet."" And the clue is that the word begins with a consonant. Spoiler alert: the answer is ""towel."" 

Now, let's take a moment to analyze today's Wordle. Personally, I rely on Wordle Bot to see how I did. It's a great tool to check your Wordles. Today, my initial guess was ""chain,"" which left me with a massive 681 words. Thankfully, ""slope"" brought that number down to a more manageable 19. I ended up going with ""below"" as my final guess, and surprisingly, it was correct. It just felt like a good guess. Maybe it was due to the Strands puzzle I did earlier today. Who knows? It might have been a coincidence.

Unfortunately, my competitive Wordle score is a total wash. I got zero points for guessing in four and zero for tying the Bot. It's zeroes all around for me today. But that's how it goes sometimes.

Now, let's take a quick look at the etymology of the word ""towel."" It originated from the Old French term ""touaille,"" which entered the English language around the 13th century. This Old French word is believed to have derived from the Medieval Latin term ""tovaglia,"" which in turn likely came from the Latin word ""tubicula,"" meaning ""tube"" or ""cloth."" The evolution of the word reflects the item's purpose in daily life, initially being a piece of cloth used for drying or wiping.

The transformation from ""touaille"" in Old French to ""towel"" in English showcases the linguistic influences of Norman French on the English language following the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. Many words of French origin underwent pronunciation and spelling changes over time, leading to the modern English word ""towel"" that we use today. Throughout the centuries, towels have remained a household staple, evolving in materials and usage, but always serving the same fundamental purpose of drying or wiping.

That's all for now, folks. I hope you enjoyed today's Wordle adventure.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/23/google-upgrade-samsung-s24-s23-pixel-towards-apple-iphone-15-pro-max/,Google Suddenly Reveals Surprise Android Update That Beats iPhone,"Android and iPhone are becoming more similar than ever before, and Google is leading the charge with a groundbreaking new feature that is set to arrive on Android devices first. In this latest update, Google not only matches an existing iPhone feature but takes it a step further, surpassing Apple in its own game.

Previously, I mentioned Google's efforts to include an emergency satellite service on Android, which brings it on par with the satellite SOS functionality that Apple has had for a few years. However, Google's offering goes beyond just matching Apple. It also incorporates a ready-made Garmin rescue service, significantly enhancing the safety and security of its extensive user base.

One limitation of Apple's emergency SOS feature is that it is only designed for emergencies, making it irrelevant for everyday users who are not engaged in extreme activities like mountain climbing or sailing. It simply displays an SOS tag on the screen when there is no coverage, which is rarely used by most people.

Now, with the release of the latest Android 15 developer preview, Google is bridging this gap by allowing users to expand their cellular accounts to include a satellite add-on. This enables core messaging apps to utilize the satellite network, eliminating the issue of cellular black spots that leave users in a connectivity void.

According to Mishaal Rahman, Android 15 DP2 includes UI elements to ensure a consistent user experience for devices with satellite connectivity. The update also introduces a new API that apps can utilize to detect when a device is connected to a satellite, expanding platform support for satellite connectivity. Additionally, Android 15 allows SMS/MMS/RCS apps to use satellite connectivity for sending and receiving messages.

The real breakthrough lies in the messaging integration. Some networks have plans to offer low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite connectivity as an account option, which is an improvement from the initial expectation of a ""Satellite SOS"" feature on Pixel phones. Apple's satellite connectivity is more limited, only allowing users to text emergency services, request roadside assistance, and share their location with friends and family when there is no mobile or Wi-Fi coverage.

There were hopes that Android would go even further, with previous beta code suggesting a satellite messaging option in partnership with T-Mobile. Elon Musk's announcement that SpaceX achieved download speeds of 17mbps to an unmodified Galaxy S21 Ultra further fueled speculations about the potential of direct-to-phone satellite connectivity without the need for special hardware. While we wait for that future to become a reality, messaging integration is a significant step forward.

Based on current information, it appears that Android 15 will indeed feature satellite messaging integration. This development showcases Google's leadership in the race between Android and iPhone, with Apple likely to follow suit. This news comes shortly after reports that Gemini, a powerful AI technology, might be coming to the iPhone. It has been an interesting week, especially considering Apple's claim that a DOJ lawsuit would essentially turn the iPhone into an Android device.

Update 3/23: Exciting new details have emerged about Google's plans for satellite messaging. Coincidentally, this news broke just after reports that Gemini might be coming to Apple's iPhone, potentially powering many of iOS 18's AI updates. This development is significant not only because it brings Android and iPhone closer together but also because it strengthens Google's position within the iPhone ecosystem.

Overall, it is clear that Android is making significant strides ahead of iPhone, particularly with the deployment of Gemini on Android handsets. While iPhone users eagerly await details about the next OS release, Android continues to push boundaries and innovate in ways that benefit users. The future of satellite messaging and connectivity looks promising, and we can expect exciting developments in the coming months.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65d79ec3dadcd6b682668331/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-23 19:17:25,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/apple-sued-microsofts-ai-ambitions-and-nvidia-surprises/,"Apple sued, Microsoft's AI ambitions and Nvidia's surprises","Welcome to this edition of Week in Review, where we bring you the latest news and updates from the tech world. In today's edition, we'll be covering the Apple antitrust lawsuit, Microsoft's AI ambitions, and more.

The U.S. Department of Justice has joined forces with international regulators to accuse Apple of using monopolistic tactics to lock in iPhone users. In response, Apple argues that the DOJ's actions could undermine what its users love about its phones and ecosystem. While there are similarities between Apple and Microsoft in terms of customer retention efforts, there are also key differences. However, experts predict that it could take several years for the lawsuit to reach a resolution.

Moving on to other news, Microsoft has acquired the co-founders of AI startup Inflection AI. Mustafa Suleyman will now lead Microsoft AI's consumer-facing unit, while Karén Simonyan is the EVP and CEO of the same group. This acquisition comes after Inflection raised $1.3 billion, with Microsoft being the largest investor.

Nvidia made waves with its recent GTC developer conference. CEO Jensen Huang surprised attendees with his prediction that artificial general intelligence is just five years away. Additionally, Nvidia announced a new AI platform called GR00T, which is designed for humanoid robots.

In a surprising development, Google and Apple are reportedly in talks to deploy Google's AI model on upcoming iOS updates. It remains to be seen whether this will be a temporary solution or a long-term partnership.

In the realm of hacking and privacy, the Biden administration is rallying an international coalition to combat commercial spyware. Interestingly, some investors who are now part of this coalition were previously involved in the very business they're now fighting against. Additionally, a recent hack disrupted an Apex Legends tournament, with the hacker claiming it was done for fun and to bring attention to the exploit used.

Glassdoor users have reported that their real names are being added to their profiles without consent. The only solution provided to them is to delete their accounts altogether. It's important to be cautious when sharing information online, especially when it comes to reviews and personal details.

Turning to funding and IPOs, Reddit's IPO had a strong start, with the stock jumping 48% on its first day of trading. Astera Labs, a company that specializes in connectivity hardware for cloud computing data centers, also experienced success, with its stock closing at $62.03 on its debut.

In other news, The Browser Company, the startup behind the Arc browser, has raised $50 million at a valuation of $550 million. The company aims to replace PCs with browsers but faces challenges in terms of monetization.

To wrap up, we delve into the world of AI. Despite its massive potential, AI still struggles with spelling, as evidenced by the often incorrect words generated in AI-generated images. Additionally, Fisker, an EV manufacturer, has paused production due to financial difficulties. The company may need to secure more funding to continue operations.

As AI systems like ChatGPT and Gemini are impossible to review comprehensively, it is crucial to put them to the test to ensure their accuracy and reliability.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianmazique/2024/03/23/ufcs-dana-white-cuts-fighter-immediately-after-he-bit-an-opponent/,UFC’s Dana White Cuts Fighter Immediately After He Bit An Opponent,"Pressure and the intensity of combat sports can sometimes lead athletes to make irrational decisions. A recent incident at UFC Fight Night: Ribas vs. Namajunas serves as a prime example of this. During his UFC debut, Igor Severino, a young Brazilian fighter, resorted to biting his opponent, Andre Lima, in the second round of their preliminary bout.

This act of aggression resulted in Severino's disqualification from the fight. Visual evidence clearly displayed the bite marks on Lima's arm, leaving no room for doubt. The incident occurred while Severino had Lima in a standing grappling position.

Severino, who is only 20 years old, had the chance to establish himself within the UFC. However, his actions on Saturday have undoubtedly made it challenging for him to return to the promotion. This disqualification marked the first loss of Severino's career, bringing his record to 9-1. In contrast, Lima maintained his undefeated status at 8-0.

UFC CEO Dana White wasted no time in making the decision to cut Severino from the organization. In an interview with KevinIole.com, White expressed his disappointment, stating, ""Those were two up-and-coming undefeated fighters. If you get frustrated and want out of the fight, there are plenty of ways to do it, but the worst thing you can do is bite your opponent. Now, you get cut and lose the biggest opportunity of your life. Not to mention, he’s going to have real problems with the NSAC.""

Biting incidents in combat sports are not unprecedented, but they are always met with severe repercussions. Remarkably, Lima remained surprisingly composed despite being bitten during the fight. He calmly informed the referee about the incident, prompting a brief investigation into the foul play.

Now, Severino faces the arduous task of rebuilding his reputation with smaller promotions before he can even contemplate competing in the UFC, Professional Fighters League, or any other reputable mixed martial arts organization. The road to redemption will not be an easy one for Severino, as he must prove himself to be a disciplined and respectful fighter.

As Saturday's events at UFC Fight Night come to a close in Las Vegas, stay tuned for more traditional fight results. It is through these performances that we witness the true spirit and skill of the athletes who dedicate themselves to the world of mixed martial arts.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff92c285143669667fa59c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3188,1794,x0,y217,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-23 22:45:24,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/23/explained-the-difference-between-a-solar-eclipse-and-a-lunar-eclipse/,Explained: The Difference Between A Solar Eclipse And A Lunar Eclipse,"Do you understand the distinction between a solar eclipse and a lunar eclipse? Two celestial events are set to occur in the upcoming weeks—a lunar eclipse on March 25 and a solar eclipse on April 8. Despite their differences, both events stem from the same cosmic alignment.

A lunar eclipse occurs when Earth's shadow falls on the moon, while a solar eclipse happens when the moon obstructs the sun's light, casting a shadow on Earth. These rare occurrences are a result of the slight variance in the orbital planes of Earth and the moon around the sun.

The occurrence of a lunar eclipse is tied to a full moon when Earth comes between the sun and the moon, projecting its shadow into space. Although full moons happen approximately every 29 days, a lunar eclipse is infrequent due to the moon rarely passing through Earth's shadow during this phase.

Conversely, a solar eclipse can only take place during a new moon when the moon is positioned between the sun and Earth, casting a shadow on our planet. While new moons occur every 29 days, a solar eclipse is a rare event as the moon seldom blocks the sun from Earth's perspective during this phase.

A total lunar eclipse is the result of a precise alignment of the sun, Earth, and moon. Earth's shadows—the outer penumbral shadow and the central umbral shadow—play a crucial role in this phenomenon. When the moon enters Earth's umbra during a full moon, it is illuminated solely by sunlight refracted through our atmosphere, resulting in a captivating display of pinkish-red hues on its surface.

The upcoming penumbral lunar eclipse on March 25, also known as the ""Worm Moon,"" will see the moon passing through Earth's penumbra.

Similarly, a total solar eclipse occurs due to a perfect alignment of the sun, moon, and Earth, coupled with a celestial coincidence. The moon's umbra, projected onto Earth during a new moon, moves across the planet as a result of its orbiting motion. This creates a path of totality within the umbral shadow, where observers can witness the awe-inspiring spectacle of a total solar eclipse.

On April 8, the new ""Pink Moon"" will block the sun entirely, resulting in a total solar eclipse visible in North America.

Eclipses are considered rare occurrences due to the moon's tilted orbit of about 5 degrees relative to the sun's path. This tilt causes the moon's trajectory to intersect the sun's path twice in each orbit, leading to solar and lunar eclipses only during the new or full moon phases. These events happen twice yearly, forming ""eclipse seasons"" when eclipses are more likely to occur.

In 2024, there will be two eclipse seasons starting on March 25 and September 17, with notable events like a total solar eclipse and a partial lunar eclipse visible in North America.

Looking ahead to 2025, two eclipse seasons are expected to begin on March 13 and September 7, featuring events such as a total lunar eclipse and a partial solar eclipse visible in various regions.

Have you ever witnessed a total solar eclipse? If you think you have, chances are you're mistaken. This is a common misconception among people who have only seen partial solar eclipses, which occur twice a year in various parts of the world. True totality, when the moon completely blocks the sun, is an experience that leaves a lasting impression. Those lucky enough to have witnessed it never forget the awe-inspiring event.

To truly witness a total solar eclipse, one must be in the path of totality, where the moon's shadow falls on Earth. This requires effort and planning, as totality is a rare occurrence. In recent years, North America has been fortunate to experience a series of total solar eclipses, including the highly anticipated ""Great American Eclipse"" in 2017. This event brought totality to 12 U.S. states, captivating millions who were fortunate enough to be within its path.

If you were in the path of totality during the Great American Eclipse, you would remember the breathtaking beauty of the twilight-like sky, the moon's silhouette, and the stunning sight of the sun's corona shining all around. It is an experience that stays with you forever, etched in your memory as one of life's most cherished moments.

For those who are unsure if they have witnessed a total solar eclipse, there are ways to verify their experience. Often, memories of solar eclipses in school or at work involve the use of solar eclipse glasses or pinhole cameras. While these memories may be from the 2017 partial solar eclipse, there have been other eclipses in living memory. To confirm the authenticity of your experience, you can consult the Solar Eclipses Visibility Database, which provides information on the location and visibility of past eclipses.

To further clarify, here is a list of total solar eclipses that have occurred in North America in the last 70 years. If you were not within the designated ""stripes"" on these specific dates, you did not witness a total solar eclipse. If the dates are not listed, it was likely a partial solar eclipse.

- [List of total solar eclipses with interactive maps]

The opportunity to witness a total solar eclipse is indeed a rare occurrence. If you encounter someone who believes they have seen one, ask them to describe their experience and where it took place. Then, gently inform them about the upcoming total eclipse on April 8, 2024. This once-in-a-lifetime event will be visible to an astonishing 42 million people, including 32 million Americans, who reside in the path of totality.

On April 8, 2024, a narrow 115-mile path will cross parts of Mexico, 15 U.S. states, and Canada, allowing those within it to experience the awe-inspiring totality. This path will traverse five states in Mexico, 15 U.S. states, and six Canadian provinces. While everyone in North America will witness a partial solar eclipse on this day, only those within the path of totality will have the privilege of experiencing the full glory of totality.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2024/03/24/epa-didnt-ban-gas-cars-it-cut-air-pollution-so-we-can-breathe-easier/,EPA Didn’t Ban Gas Cars. It Cut Air Pollution So We Can Breathe Easier.,"On red air days, when pollution levels spike, the metallic taste of contaminated air lingers in our noses and lungs. It's a stark reminder of the toxic air we breathe, prompting caution for vulnerable groups like the elderly, children, pregnant women, and those with respiratory ailments.

The primary culprit behind this pervasive air pollution? Internal combustion engines powered by gasoline or diesel. These engines are major contributors to the dirty emissions that pollute our atmosphere. With over two-thirds of Americans relying on personal vehicles for daily transportation, it's no surprise that the transportation sector is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. Light-duty vehicles alone are responsible for nearly 60% of this pollution.

To combat this pressing issue, we must tackle tailpipe emissions from vehicles. The good news is that we have a powerful solution at our disposal: tailpipe emissions standards. Recently, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency took a significant step by introducing new multi-pollutant regulations for light-duty and smaller medium-duty vehicles. These rules aim to limit the harmful emissions that compromise our air quality and contribute to climate change. Automakers are now required to embrace cutting-edge clean technologies to ensure that new vehicles are cleaner than ever before.

Every individual should have the opportunity to choose a clean car for their next vehicle. Those who prioritize reducing pollution deserve the option to drive electric vehicles.

Despite the benefits of cleaner air, some entities are not as enthusiastic about these new standards. Corporations that profit from selling polluting vehicles and fossil fuels view these regulations as a hindrance. They argue that these standards impede consumer choice and infringe on American freedoms.

In reality, these updated pollution limits are long overdue and will have widespread benefits. They will enhance air quality, particularly benefiting the 36% of the U.S. population affected by air pollution. People living in areas with unhealthy air quality face various respiratory issues, with children's lung development particularly at risk. Moreover, individuals from marginalized communities are disproportionately impacted by air pollution.

It's crucial to debunk the misinformation spread by profit-driven corporations. They have launched campaigns to mislead the public, framing the standards as a ban on gas vehicles. However, the truth is that the EPA's standards are technology-neutral, performance-based, and grounded in scientific research.

The Clean Air Act, enacted in 1970, empowers the EPA to establish air quality standards to safeguard public health and regulate emissions from vehicles. Over the years, these standards have driven innovation in engine and emission control technologies, leading to significant reductions in harmful pollutants. Prior to the Clean Air Act, cities like New York and Los Angeles grappled with severe air pollution, posing serious health risks to residents.

As we reflect on the progress made in combatting air pollution, it's evident that stringent emissions standards play a vital role in safeguarding public health and the environment. By embracing cleaner technologies and advocating for sustainable transportation options, we can create a healthier future for all. Let's continue to support initiatives that prioritize clean air and empower individuals to make environmentally conscious choices.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fe401fc35aefb76700b52e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 07:45:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/anuradhavaranasi/2024/03/24/which-adhd-medications-could-lower-risk-of-suicide--hospitalization/,Which ADHD Medications Could Lower Risk Of Suicide & Hospitalization?,"ADHD medications are associated with a lower risk of suicidal behavior and psychiatric hospitalizations, according to a new study. The research, which included over 200,000 individuals with ADHD, found that those who were prescribed ADHD stimulant medications had a decreased risk of attempting suicide or dying by suicide. Additionally, the use of ADHD medications was linked to fewer psychiatric hospitalizations.

The study, conducted by researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, focused on four ADHD medications: amphetamine, lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate. The researchers found that these medications were associated with a decreased risk of being hospitalized due to psychiatric co-morbidities. However, a decreased risk of suicidal behavior was only observed with the use of lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate.

Previous studies have shown that individuals with ADHD are more likely to have psychiatric co-morbidities compared to those without ADHD. Conditions such as major depressive disorder, panic disorder, substance abuse, generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, PTSD, and psychotic symptoms are commonly seen in individuals with ADHD. The prevalence of psychiatric co-morbidity among those with ADHD was found to be 52%, while it was only 7% among individuals without ADHD. The presence of psychiatric co-morbidities also increased the risk of mortality, particularly when substance use disorder was involved.

The researchers noted that while atomoxetine, an ADHD medication, was not linked to a lower risk of psychiatric hospitalizations or suicidal behavior, it was associated with fewer hospitalizations for non-psychiatric co-morbidities. They emphasized the need for further investigation into the long-term effectiveness and safety of ADHD medications, as they have been found to have both beneficial psychiatric outcomes and possible adverse outcomes.

For this study, the researchers analyzed data from 221,714 individuals between the ages of 16 to 65 years old who had received an ADHD diagnosis in Sweden between 2006 and 2021. The study participants' healthcare data, including inpatient and outpatient records, were collected from the Swedish National Patient Register. The researchers also obtained data from the Prescribed Drug Register to track the purchase of prescribed ADHD medications. Methylphenidate was the most commonly used medication, followed by lisdexamphetamine and atomoxetine.

During the 15-year follow-up period, it was found that 56% of the study participants had a psychiatric co-morbidity, with anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and stress-related disorders being the most common. Approximately 26% of the participants had been hospitalized due to a psychiatric co-morbidity. Interestingly, the effectiveness of the medications varied based on age and gender. Lisdexamphetamine was associated with a decreased risk of psychiatric hospitalizations among adolescents, young adults, and adults aged 30 and older, while methylphenidate appeared to be less effective among older adults. Atomoxetine was linked to a decreased risk of hospitalization among women but not men.

The researchers acknowledged concerns about the long-term use of stimulant medications, such as increased blood pressure and heart rate, which could potentially increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, there are concerns about the risk of seizures and the possibility of psychosis or mania. However, overall, the study found that the use of ADHD medications had a beneficial effect on psychiatric outcomes and a decreased risk of non-psychiatric hospitalizations.

The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and safety of ADHD medications. While further research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects, this study highlights the potential benefits of these medications in reducing the risk of suicidal behavior and psychiatric hospitalizations among individuals with ADHD.
