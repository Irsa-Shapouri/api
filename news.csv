https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/apple-sued-microsofts-ai-ambitions-and-nvidia-surprises/,"Apple sued, Microsoft's AI ambitions and Nvidia's surprises","Welcome to the latest edition of Week in Review! This week, we have some exciting news about Apple's antitrust lawsuit and Microsoft's AI ambitions. So, let's get right into it.

The U.S. has joined international regulators in accusing Apple of using monopolistic tactics to lock in iPhone users. In response, Apple claims that the Department of Justice's actions could ruin exactly what its users enjoy about its phones and ecosystem.

The lawsuit draws a connection between Apple and Microsoft in the 1990s, highlighting some key differences between the two companies and their efforts to retain customers. However, experts predict that not much will come out of the lawsuit in the short-term, as it could take three to five years to reach a resolution.

Now, let's move on to other news. Microsoft recently acquired Inflection AI's co-founders, Mustafa Suleyman and Kar√©n Simonyan. Suleyman will lead Microsoft AI's consumer-facing unit, while Simonyan will serve as the EVP and CEO of the same group. This move comes after Inflection raised $1.3 billion, with Microsoft being its biggest investor.

Nvidia's GTC event also made headlines this week. In a surprising announcement, CEO Jensen Huang predicted that artificial general intelligence would be achievable within five years. Additionally, Nvidia unveiled a new AI platform for humanoid robots called GR00T.

Google and Apple are reportedly in talks that could lead to Google's AI model being deployed on iPhones for several upcoming iOS updates. It remains to be seen if this will be a temporary solution until Apple's own AI efforts catch up or if it will lead to a long-term partnership.

In the realm of hacking and privacy, the Biden administration is forming an international coalition to combat commercial spyware, with investors now joining the fight. However, it has come to light that one of these investors was previously involved in the very business they are now fighting against.

There was also an interesting hacking incident where a gaming tournament was disrupted by hackers who claimed they did it ""for fun."" Their intention was to highlight the exploit used to disrupt the tournament and bring attention to developers.

Glassdoor users have reported that their real names are being added to their profiles without their consent. Unfortunately, the only solution provided to them is to delete their accounts entirely. It's important to double-check your profile if you've left a negative review about a past employer.

Moving on to funding and IPOs, Reddit's IPO had a strong start, with the stock jumping 48% on its first day of trading. Astera Labs, a company that produces connectivity hardware for cloud computing data centers, also saw success, with its stock closing at $62.03 on day one.

Lastly, The Browser Company, the startup behind the Arc browser, raised $50 million at a valuation of $550 million. The company has an ambitious plan to replace PCs with browsers but is still unclear about its path to monetization.

In our bonus round, we explore why AI often struggles with spelling, despite its massive potential. We also discuss Fisker, a company that has paused production due to financial difficulties. If they can't raise more capital, they may cease operations altogether. Lastly, we delve into the importance of testing AI systems, even though they can't be fully reviewed.

That wraps up this edition of Week in Review. We hope you found it informative and engaging. Stay tuned for more updates in the world of technology and innovation!","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/apple-antitrust-doj-splash.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-23 20:15:37,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have more in common than you might think. Both companies experienced unexpected growth in their core businesses. AWS realized that it could sell the internal services it had created for itself, while Nvidia discovered that its GPU, originally designed for gaming, was well-suited for AI workloads. This led to explosive revenue growth for both companies, with Nvidia's revenue increasing from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024 to $22.1 billion in Q4 2024.

While AWS has consistently been a major revenue driver for Amazon, Nvidia's growth has been even more impressive. However, as the cloud market has become more competitive, both companies are facing challenges. Microsoft and Google have joined the market, and other chip makers are expected to gain market share in the future. Despite this, both Nvidia and AWS were in the right place at the right time. As web apps and mobile emerged, the cloud provided on-demand resources, and enterprises saw the value of moving workloads to the cloud. Similarly, the rise of AI and large language models coincided with the increased use of GPUs for processing these workloads.

AWS has grown into a highly profitable business, but its growth has started to slow down, while Nvidia's growth continues. The question is whether Nvidia can sustain this growth and become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS. While Nvidia does have other businesses, they are smaller revenue generators that are growing more slowly than the GPU data center business.

In terms of short-term financial outlook, Nvidia's revenue growth has been astronomical recently, and it is expected to continue. In its recent earnings report, Nvidia projected $24 billion in revenue for its current quarter, a growth rate of around 234% compared to the previous year's first quarter. However, as the company's revenue ramp slows, its growth rate is expected to decline. Analysts predict Nvidia to generate $110.5 billion in revenue for the current fiscal year, an 81% increase from the previous year, but lower than the 126% gain in the previous fiscal year.

Despite these growth declines, Nvidia is still expected to scale its revenue past the $100 billion annual run rate mark for the next several quarters. The company sees significant growth opportunities ahead, especially in AI, even as competition from AMD, Intel, and other chipmakers emerges. Nvidia currently controls a significant portion of the market and can afford to face stiffer competition. At the chip level, Nvidia remains dominant, although AMD is gaining ground at the board level.

In conclusion, Nvidia and AWS have experienced remarkable growth due to their ability to recognize and capitalize on market opportunities. While AWS growth has started to slow down, Nvidia's growth continues, and it has the potential to become a long-term revenue powerhouse. With its strong position in the market and the increasing demand for AI processing, Nvidia is well-positioned for continued growth in the coming years.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/24/new-whatsapp-warning-iphone-15-pro-max-samsung-s24-ultra-upgrade/,New WhatsApp Warning Suddenly Issued For 2 Billion Users,"WhatsApp has recently launched a significant upgrade, but there is one feature within the app that you should avoid at all costs, as it could have dangerous consequences. This year, 2024, is expected to bring about major changes in the global messaging landscape. From iMessage incorporating RCS, WhatsApp introducing a third-party chat hub, Gemini AI integrating with Google Messages, to the Department of Justice (DOJ) filing a lawsuit against Apple with iMessage playing a central role, these changes all revolve around a common theme - a misunderstanding of end-to-end encryption.

End-to-end encryption is a crucial aspect of messaging apps like iMessage, WhatsApp, and Signal, and it has now become the default setting for Google Messages and Facebook Messenger. The level of encryption provided by these apps is so important that WhatsApp has warned users that third-party chats are not as secure as chats within the app. The DOJ has also emphasized that Apple's denial of full iMessage security on Android makes iPhone users less secure. Despite pressure from various governments and security agencies, Facebook Messenger has also adopted end-to-end encryption by default.

Given the significance of end-to-end encryption, it is surprising to see media reports encouraging users to transfer their chats and chat history from WhatsApp to Telegram. While WhatsApp allows users to export their chats and select Telegram as the recipient, this move is alarming. Unlike WhatsApp, Telegram does not provide end-to-end encryption by default. Its ""secret chat"" option needs to be manually selected for each one-on-one chat. Kaspersky warned last year that Telegram is not as secure as it claims to be, as its chats do not use end-to-end encryption by default, and users are not informed about the secure chat option.

Therefore, moving chats from WhatsApp, which is end-to-end encrypted by default, to Telegram, which is not, poses a significant security risk. This is especially true for group chats that contain otherwise secure content from multiple users. Even though WhatsApp is part of Mark Zuckerberg's data-driven empire, it still prioritizes user privacy and security by providing end-to-end encryption without requiring any additional actions from the user.

When Telegram initially promoted the migration of WhatsApp chats, I warned users that this was a dangerous move, despite it happening amidst the backlash against WhatsApp when Meta (formerly Facebook) threatened to change user terms and conditions. ESET's Jake Moore advises against pulling content out of end-to-end encrypted messaging platforms, as doing so removes the protective barriers designed to safeguard messages. While accessibility is important in today's online world, it should not come at the cost of security and privacy. Telegram may boast about its cross-platform usability, but that is only possible because it taps into the content on its central servers, which would not be feasible with end-to-end encryption.

Telegram also promotes the reduction of smartphone storage by storing everything in its cloud. However, its architecture is designed for accessibility and simplicity, not full encryption. The security of your data is dependent on policy, rather than technology. Therefore, I strongly advise against following any advice to switch from WhatsApp to Telegram. It is a step backward, regardless of what the marketing may suggest. Additionally, there are other concerning issues associated with Telegram.

Telegram plays contrasting roles in the messaging world. On one hand, it aims to be an easy-to-use alternative to WhatsApp with a range of features, hence the option to migrate chats. On the other hand, it is known for its association with the dark web, and Spain's High Court recently suspended Telegram due to a lack of content controls. The Financial Times has also highlighted Telegram's use by organized criminals, describing it as ""social media for organized criminals."" However, it is not just criminals who use Telegram; it is also popular among campaigners and activists of various causes.

In conclusion, it is crucial to prioritize privacy and security when choosing a messaging app. While Telegram may offer certain conveniences, it falls short in terms of default end-to-end encryption. Therefore, I strongly recommend sticking with WhatsApp or other messaging apps that prioritize user privacy and provide end-to-end encryption by default.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65b41420a2b346798e66d370/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2207,1442,x681,y315,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 23:45:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-blocks-use-intel-amd-chips-government-computers-ft-reports-2024-03-24/,"China blocks use of Intel and AMD chips in government computers, FT reports","China's government has issued new procurement guidance that aims to reduce reliance on foreign technology and promote domestic options. The guidance encourages government agencies to prioritize ""safe and reliable"" processors and operating systems made by Chinese companies when making purchases. This move is seen as an effort to sideline foreign-made technology, particularly Microsoft's Windows operating system and foreign-made database software.

The Chinese industry ministry released a statement in late December that listed CPUs, operating systems, and centralized databases from Chinese companies that are considered ""safe and reliable"" for a period of three years. The intention behind this list is to provide government agencies with a clear reference when making technology procurement decisions.

While the specific criteria for determining what is considered ""safe and reliable"" have not been disclosed, the government's objective is to enhance cybersecurity and protect national interests. By promoting domestic technology, China aims to reduce potential vulnerabilities in its critical infrastructure and safeguard sensitive data.

This development comes amid increasing geopolitical tensions between China and the United States. The U.S. has been actively seeking to boost its domestic semiconductor industry and reduce reliance on China and Taiwan. In 2022, the Biden administration introduced the CHIPS and Science Act, which includes measures to support U.S. semiconductor production, such as financial aid and subsidies for the production of advanced chips.

The impact of China's procurement guidance extends beyond just the technology sector. It is also likely to have implications for global trade and the competitiveness of foreign companies operating in China. Foreign technology companies may face challenges in the Chinese market as the government encourages the use of domestic alternatives. This move could potentially lead to a bifurcation of the global technology industry, with separate ecosystems developing in China and the rest of the world.

It is worth noting that China is not the only country taking steps to promote domestic technology. Other countries, including the U.S., have implemented policies to strengthen their domestic semiconductor industries and reduce reliance on foreign suppliers. As technology becomes increasingly intertwined with national security and economic interests, governments are prioritizing strategies that enhance their technological sovereignty.

In conclusion, China's new procurement guidance reflects its efforts to reduce reliance on foreign technology and promote domestic options. By encouraging government agencies to prioritize ""safe and reliable"" processors and operating systems made by Chinese companies, China aims to enhance cybersecurity and protect national interests. This move has potential implications for global trade and the competitiveness of foreign technology companies operating in China. As geopolitical tensions continue to shape the global technology landscape, governments around the world are taking steps to strengthen their domestic technology industries.",https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5R35K5J7YFJ3DDUQRVT67HNQO4.jpg?auth=c9bfe9c0c45eee5aac0a97b1b99463106991b2c492d5cabc2908225e306ec967&width=1920&height=1005&smart=true,2024-03-24 05:11:17,Innovation,Innovation

https://venturebeat.com/ai/companies-are-about-to-waste-billions-on-ai-heres-how-not-to-become-one-of-them/,Companies are about to waste billions on AI - here's how not to become one of them,"Join us in Boston on March 27 for an exclusive networking event focused on data integrity. This event, hosted by Gen AI enterprise leaders, promises to offer valuable insights and engaging conversations. Request your invite now to secure your spot.

When it comes to new technologies, caution often goes out the window during the hype cycle phase. Venture capitalists (VCs) feel the pressure to invest their raised capital and don't want to miss out on the next big thing. The same pressure is felt within companies, especially when it comes to AI and related technologies. Everything from large language models (LLMs) to machine learning (ML) falls under the AI umbrella. Suddenly, projects that were previously denied funding get a second chance when labeled as AI initiatives.

However, this excitement and rush to invest in AI can lead to billions of wasted dollars over the next decade. While previous technology waves like search, social, and mobile have had a lasting impact, others like virtual reality (VR) and crypto have been more limited. Despite this, the headlines from five years ago would have made you believe otherwise. Currently, everyone is eager to show their AI investments and how it will revolutionize everything. But this shotgun approach to investing results in a few successful hits and many misses. It's a gamble driven by the fear of missing out rather than a well-thought-out strategy.

That being said, LLMs are undeniably a game-changing technology. Just look at how quickly ChatGPT gained 100 million users compared to other transformative companies. Almost every enterprise company is exploring ways to leverage LLMs and AI. The question is, how do you decide where to invest and where you have a realistic chance of success?

To make informed decisions and avoid wasted spend, there are three key factors to consider:

1. Understand the total cost over time: Before saying yes to an AI project, evaluate the resources required to sustain it. Often, the work of a data science team is just the tip of the iceberg. Engineering, DevOps, QA, product development, and SysOps all add significant costs. Many companies have abandoned projects that were initially promising but lacked ongoing investment. Saying no to an AI initiative is challenging, but frequent yeses can hinder future support for truly worthwhile endeavors.

Additionally, AI comes with increasing marginal costs. Training, running, and maintaining large models is expensive. Overusing AI without a corresponding increase in value erodes profit margins. Moreover, retracting promised functionality can damage customer satisfaction and harm a company's reputation. Look at how a few missteps affected Google's image as an AI leader and recall the early days of IBM's Watson.

2. Ask why no one else can do it: The concept of commoditization is easy to forget when reading textbooks. However, experiencing it firsthand leaves a lasting impression. In the tech industry, there are monopolies and commodities. When considering an AI initiative, ask yourself, ""Why us?"" If what you're working on is destined to become a commodity, it won't be enjoyable, especially if you lack scale or cost advantages. Nvidia and AWS/Azure are the ones who will benefit the most. To overcome this, focus on areas where you have a defensive moat, such as preferential access to data, proprietary insights, or a head start in an application with strong network effects.

3. Make a few strategic bets: The simplest and most effective bets are the ones that enhance your existing business. As the old BASF commercial says, ""We don't make the things you buy, we make the things you buy better."" If applying AI can provide momentum to your products or services, it's a worthwhile investment. However, it's important to commit fully to these bets and see them through. Half-hearted attempts won't yield the desired results.

In conclusion, while there is a lot of excitement around AI, it's crucial to approach it with a clear-eyed perspective. Understanding the total cost, evaluating why your company is uniquely positioned to succeed, and making strategic bets are key to avoiding wasted spend. LLMs and AI have the potential to transform businesses, but it's essential to navigate this technology wave with caution and strategic foresight.",https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/An_AI_sitting_in_a_corner_curled_up_looking_sa-transformed.jpeg?w=1200&strip=all,2024-03-24 18:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.reuters.com/technology/binance-end-support-usdc-stablecoin-tron-blockchain-2024-03-25/,Binance to end support for USDC stablecoin on Tron blockchain network,"Cryptocurrency exchange Binance has announced that it will no longer support deposits and withdrawals via the Tron blockchain network for a digital stablecoin tied to the U.S. dollar.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/techcrunch-mobility-the-wheels-are-starting-to-come-off-the-fisker-ev-bus/,TechCrunch Mobility: The wheels are starting to come off the Fisker EV bus,"Welcome to TechCrunch Mobility, your source for all things transportation. In this edition, we'll discuss the latest developments in the automotive industry and beyond. But before we dive in, let's touch on some recent activity on Capitol Hill. The Biden Administration has proposed two new standards through the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency that will have a significant impact on U.S. automakers and consumers.

The DOE has introduced a more lenient ""petroleum equivalency factor"" that assigns a score to electric vehicles (EVs) under the government's corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. This change aims to avoid hefty fines for automakers who struggle to meet the CAFE standards. The EPA, on the other hand, has released tailpipe standards for model year cars and light-duty trucks from 2027 to 2032. These standards impose stricter requirements on automakers but offer flexibility in meeting them through various powertrain technologies. This move is a step back from the original proposal that mandated EV sales to make up 67% of the U.S. passenger vehicle market by 2032.

While these standards have little impact on EV startups like Rivian, Tesla, and Lucid, they pose challenges for legacy automakers who are investing billions in EV development while still profiting from internal combustion engine vehicles. Plug-in hybrids may emerge as the winners in this scenario.

Moving on to the news of the week, we have several exciting articles to share. First up, Rivian has announced a partnership with Tesla, which could lead to significant advancements in the EV space. We also have a spotlight on Candela, an electric boat startup that recently raised $25 million in funding. Additionally, we'll discuss the financial struggles faced by Fisker and a startup tackling extended warranties.

In other news, Clevon, a company working on autonomous delivery technology, was rumored to be shutting down. However, the company's CEO has confirmed that it is still operational and is in the process of finalizing a merger agreement with an American EV company. Unfortunately, this merger has resulted in some layoffs.

Lastly, we have a noteworthy deal of the week. Uber, known for its global presence, has made its first investment in an Africa-founded startup. Moove, a mobility fintech company that provides vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers, raised $100 million in a Series B funding round led by Uber. This investment aligns with Uber's commitment to transitioning to a fully zero-emission fleet by 2040.

That's all for this week's edition of TechCrunch Mobility. Stay tuned for more updates on the future of transportation.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1363022906.jpg?resize=1200,730",2024-03-24 19:00:33,Innovation,Innovation
