A total solar eclipse is a captivating event that requires a few specific conditions to fully experience. First, you must position yourself within the narrow path of totality, which is only 115 miles wide. Secondly, you need to be in a location with a clear sky. Lastly, you must remove your eclipse glasses at the precise moment to witness the sun's magnificent corona.

Although these requirements may sound overwhelming, most people do not fulfill them all. However, it is the act of removing the eclipse glasses that tends to cause the most anxiety among potential eclipse chasers.

The answer is quite simple: remove your eclipse glasses when it becomes dark. That's it. If you are within the path of totality, darkness will descend rapidly as the moon's shadow engulfs your surroundings. This moment is unmistakable and impossible to miss. Conversely, if you are not within the path of totality, it will not become dark, so you should continue wearing your eclipse glasses.

Interestingly, there are now smartphone apps available that provide an immersive audio experience during a solar eclipse. These apps guide you through the entire process, including when to remove your eclipse glasses as totality commences. They also offer instructions on observing various phenomena, such as shadow bands (wavy lines on the ground caused by Earth's turbulent atmosphere when the sun is a small crescent), Baily's beads (the last remnants of sunlight), and the diamond ring effect (a dazzling bead resembling a halo as the corona emerges).

As these apps primarily rely on audio instructions and narration, it is advisable to use them with earphones. Instead of opting for earbuds that isolate you from your surroundings, choose over-the-ear bone conduction earphones for a more comfortable and inclusive experience.

Let's take a look at some of the available apps:

1. The Eclipse Company
- Platforms: iOS and Android
- Cost: Additional fee for the Pro version (exact price to be confirmed)
The Pro version of The Eclipse Company's app offers real-time weather updates, cloud forecasts for totality, a countdown timer with a vibration alert to safely remove your solar eclipse glasses, and detailed information about local eclipse events. It also provides alerts for observing eclipse phenomena, creating an immersive audio experience. However, it remains silent during totality.

2. Solar Eclipse Timer App
- Platforms: iOS and Android
- Cost: $1.99 per eclipse
The Solar Eclipse Timer app utilizes your device's geolocation to confirm whether you are within or outside the path of totality. It then guides you through the contact times and explains the various eclipse phenomena. Developed by eclipse chaser and educator Gordon Telepun, author of ""Eclipse Day: 2024 and More"" on Apple Books, this app is particularly suitable for photographers. It even offers a ""Photographer's Mode"" developed with the assistance of ex-NASA eclipse calculator and photographer Fred Espenak, also known as ""Mr. Eclipse.""

3. One Eclipse
- Platforms: iOS (no Android version available)
- Cost: $1.99
Created by the non-profit organizations Astronomers Without Borders and Simulation Curriculum (developers of the SkySafari planetarium app), One Eclipse supports a recycling program for eclipse glasses in underserved communities worldwide. Alongside allowing you to simulate the eclipse from your current location or any other spot on Earth, the app includes an interactive map with precise eclipse event times. It also features a dynamic Eclipse Countdown clock with a simple audio timer for each phase of the eclipse.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/krisholt/2024/03/24/nyt-connections-hints-and-answers-for-monday-march-25/,"NYT ‘Connections’ Hints And Answers For Monday, March 25","Welcome to today's game of Connections! Are you ready to put your word skills to the test? In this game, you will be presented with a grid of 16 words, and your goal is to arrange them into four groups of four by finding the links between them. These links could be anything from horror movie franchises to types of verbs or even rappers.

Remember, there is only one solution for each puzzle, so be careful when considering words that might fit into multiple categories. If you're stuck, you can shuffle the words to see if any connections become clearer.

Each group is color coded, with yellow being the easiest, blue and green falling in the middle, and purple being the most challenging. The purple group often involves wordplay, so keep that in mind as you work through the puzzle.

To play, simply select four words that you believe go together and press Submit. If your guess is incorrect, you will lose a life. If you're close to having a correct group, you may receive a message indicating that you're only one word away from getting it right, but you'll still need to figure out which word to swap.

Be careful not to make four mistakes, as that will result in a game over. But don't worry, I'm here to help with some hints, and if you're really struggling, I'll provide you with the answers.

Now, let's dive into today's puzzle. Here are the 16 words you'll be working with:

- PACE
- CLIPPER
- MOVE
- MEDICINE
- FASTER
- PROMPTER
- ROCKET
- SPEED
- GO
- SPUR
- COMMUTE
- HURRY
- RATE
- VISION
- CLIP
- PACER

Before we jump into the puzzle, here are some hints for each of today's groups:

Yellow group: This group is all about something's swiftness.
Green group: These words are all about speeding up!
Blue group: Can you find the NBA team player in this group?
Purple group: These words are linked by a term meaning ""over a long distance.""

Now it's time to reveal the groups without immediately telling you which words go into them. Remember, scroll slowly if you don't want any spoilers.

Today's groups are:

Yellow group: how fast something is going
Green group: ""step on it!""
Blue group: NBA team player
Purple group: tele____

And now, it's time for the answers. But beware, spoilers ahead! Only continue reading if you're ready to uncover today's Connections answers.

Today's Connections answers are:

Yellow group: how fast something is going - CLIP, PACE, RATE, SPEED
Green group: ""step on it!"" - FASTER, GO, HURRY, MOVE
Blue group: NBA team player - CLIPPER, PACER, ROCKET, SPUR
Purple group: tele____ - COMMUTE, MEDICINE, PROMPTER, VISION

While there may not be a perfect game today, I have managed to maintain my streak of five games in a row. The blue group was a bit tricky, but I quickly realized they were not a red herring. The green and yellow groups were interesting because they seemed to represent the noun and verb versions of the same concept. Finally, after correcting my mistake of including COMMUTE with the greens instead of FASTER, I was able to figure out the connection for the purples and secure a victory.

That's all for today's Connections clues and answers. If you need hints or the solution for Tuesday's game, be sure to check my blog. And before I go, here's a quick life tip: make it a point to dine at the best restaurant in your area at least once. Save up each month if you have to. Trust me, the experience will be worth it. While takeout is nice, there's something special about dining at the consensus best place nearby that will create lasting memories.

Now go out there and conquer the day!",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/64dbcee7d64da3663d88000e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 17:30:02,Innovation,Innovation
