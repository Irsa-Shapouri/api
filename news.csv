https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-co8322-sustainable-fuel.html,Research lights up process for turning COâ‚‚ into sustainable fuel,"Scientists have made a breakthrough in the field of renewable energy by successfully converting carbon dioxide (CO2) into methanol using sunlight and copper atoms. This discovery has significant implications for the development of green fuels and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

A collaborative effort between researchers from the University of Nottingham's School of Chemistry, University of Birmingham, University of Queensland, and University of Ulm led to the creation of a material composed of copper anchored on nanocrystalline carbon nitride. By embedding copper atoms within the nanocrystalline structure, electrons were able to move from carbon nitride to CO2, a crucial step in the production of methanol under the influence of solar irradiation. The findings of this research have been published in the Sustainable Energy & Fuels journal.

Photocatalysis, the process of using light to excite electrons in a semiconductor material, has been employed to react with CO2 and water, resulting in the production of various useful products, including methanol. However, this process has been hindered by low efficiency and selectivity. This breakthrough addresses these challenges and offers a promising solution for the conversion of CO2 into valuable fuels.

Carbon dioxide is a major contributor to global warming, making it imperative to find methods to convert it into useful products. Traditional thermal methods rely on hydrogen sourced from fossil fuels, which is not sustainable in the long run. The development of alternative methods based on photo- and electrocatalysis, utilizing solar energy and abundant water, is crucial for a sustainable future.

Dr. Madasamy Thangamuthu, a research fellow at the University of Nottingham, emphasized the importance of selecting the right materials for photocatalysis. Their approach involved controlling the material at the nanoscale, resulting in a new form of carbon nitride with crystalline nanoscale domains that enhance light absorption and charge separation.

To maximize the functional properties of carbon nitride for photocatalysis, the researchers developed a process of heating the material to achieve the desired crystallinity. They then deposited atomic copper onto the carbon nitride using magnetron sputtering, allowing for close contact between the semiconductor and metal atoms.

The experimental results were promising. Even without copper, the new form of carbon nitride exhibited 44 times more activity than traditional carbon nitride. However, the addition of just 1 mg of copper per 1 g of carbon nitride quadrupled the efficiency and significantly altered the selectivity of the reaction. Instead of producing methane, another greenhouse gas, methanol, a valuable green fuel, was generated.

Professor Andrei Khlobystov from the University of Nottingham emphasized the importance of sustainable catalyst materials for carbon dioxide valorization. The new catalyst consists of carbon, nitrogen, and copper, all of which are abundant on Earth. This makes it a more environmentally friendly option for CO2 conversion and aligns with the UK's goal of achieving a net-zero carbon footprint.

This breakthrough represents a significant advancement in the field of photocatalytic CO2 conversion. It provides insights into the design of highly selective and tunable catalysts, where the desired product can be controlled by manipulating the catalyst at the nanoscale.

In conclusion, the successful conversion of carbon dioxide into methanol using sunlight and copper atoms is a major step forward in the development of green fuels. This discovery offers a more sustainable and efficient method for harnessing solar energy and addressing the challenges posed by global warming. By utilizing abundant and environmentally friendly catalyst materials, scientists have paved the way for a cleaner and greener future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/research-lights-up-pro.jpg,2024-03-25 20:10:01,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.forbes.com/sites/timtreadgold/2024/03/25/us-and-australia-get-cosy-over-critical-metals/,U.S. And Australia Get Cosy Over Critical Metals,"The global pursuit of critical metals for innovative technologies and renewable energy is strengthening the relationship between the U.S. and Australia, while creating a divide with China. Two recent deals highlight this trend, one involving lithium, a key battery metal, and the other concerning rare earths, which are crucial in various applications including wind turbines.

Pilbara Minerals, a successful lithium miner in Australia, has expressed its interest in forging closer ties with the U.S. and taking advantage of the investment incentives offered, even while partnering with a Chinese company in an expansion project. The plan is to construct a lithium conversion plant outside of China in collaboration with China's Ganfeng Lithium Group, while utilizing the U.S. Government's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Although the success of this plan is yet to be determined, Pilbara's management believes it can work. The aim is to explore new battery materials markets outside of China and capitalize on the subsidies provided by the U.S.

The Australian Financial Review recently summarized Pilbara Minerals' plan with the headline: ""Pilbara Minerals mulls building a lithium processing plant anywhere but China."" The specifics of how Pilbara will structure a joint venture with a Chinese partner while still accessing the incentives offered by the IRA are not yet clear.

The second significant deal between Australia and the U.S. involves finding a solution to a long-standing challenge of monetizing a unique geological structure rich in rare earths and other critical minerals. The Export-Import Bank (EXIM), a trade finance arm of the U.S. Government, has issued a $600 million letter of interest to Australian Strategic Minerals (ASM) to assist with funding the final design and development of the Dubbo project in the Australian state of New South Wales. Shortly after the EXIM announcement, ASM awarded a contract to Bechtel, one of the largest U.S. engineering and construction firms, for ore processing and infrastructure technical services. This partnership between a government financing agency and a major engineering company solidifies U.S. involvement in the Dubbo project, which has undergone a 30-year evaluation process to find a profitable way to extract minerals from a complex orebody.

Ailie MacAdam, president of Bechtel Mining and Metals, emphasized the global strategic importance of the Dubbo project in the rare earths and critical mineral sector. The minerals to be extracted at Dubbo include high-value rare earths such as neodymium and praseodymium, as well as tantalum, niobium, hafnium, and zirconium. The challenge for ASM lies in separating these different metals and producing materials that meet customer requirements at a competitive price.

The Australia-U.S. Taskforce on Critical Minerals has prioritized the development of the Dubbo project to leverage Australia's geological resources for the benefit of U.S. industry. Rowena Smith, CEO of ASM, believes that the Dubbo project is well-positioned to support the joint objectives of Australia and the U.S.

In conclusion, the global pursuit of critical metals is driving closer ties between the U.S. and Australia, while creating a gap with China. Deals involving lithium and rare earths demonstrate the efforts made by both countries to secure a stable supply of these essential materials. The partnerships formed and the government support received signify the strategic importance of these metals in the development of innovative technologies and renewable energy.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660204347dcbbcbc0ad19587/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 21:27:14,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/christianmiller/2024/03/25/getting-more-impatient-when-the-end-is-in-sight-taylor-swifts-new-album-covid-vaccines-and-the-2020-presidential-election/,Getting More Impatient When the End Is in Sight,"Are you eagerly awaiting Taylor Swift's highly anticipated new album, The Tortured Poets Department? As the release date approaches, you might find yourself feeling increasingly impatient. But have you ever wondered why this is the case? A recent study conducted by Annabelle Roberts from the University of Texas and Ayelet Fishbach from the University of Chicago sheds light on this phenomenon.

While it may seem logical to assume that impatience grows as the wait becomes longer, the researchers found that the opposite is often true. Their study revealed that people experience heightened impatience towards the end of their wait, not because of the time and energy invested but due to their desire for closure in that particular area of their lives.

To explore this further, the researchers conducted various studies. In one study, they focused on the COVID-19 pandemic and the release of the first vaccines in the United States in the spring of 2021. They surveyed 161 participants at different intervals, starting from the announcement of the successful Pfizer trial. The results showed that participants' impatience for the vaccine increased over time, while their impatience for the pandemic to end remained relatively stable. This suggests that impatience rises as the end draws near.

Another study examined the 2020 U.S. presidential race between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. The researchers surveyed 215 participants in the days leading up to Election Day, including an extra day in their data set when the results were not yet settled. The findings revealed that impatience grew as the election approached its conclusion, regardless of whether participants supported Biden or Trump. This indicates a common desire for closure regarding the election outcome.

Additional studies conducted by Roberts and Fishbach explored impatience in various scenarios. Participants were asked about their impatience while waiting for a bus, receiving a package, tracking a delivery truck's progress, or enduring a traffic delay. In all cases, impatience increased as the remaining time decreased. The total waiting time was not the primary factor; rather, it was the proximity to the end that fueled impatience.

The implications of this research are significant. Those responsible for managing situations with waiting periods, such as government officials, nurses, or customer service representatives, should inform people about delays as early as possible and potentially overestimate the waiting time. Additionally, individuals anticipating long-awaited events can benefit from planning activities, such as reading or listening to podcasts, to help cope with escalating impatience.

So, for all the devoted Swifties eagerly counting down the days until the release of Taylor Swift's new album (April 19th!), rest assured that your impatience will likely intensify as the remaining time dwindles. However, take solace in the knowledge that closure is just around the corner.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65f253e5f8f81a9d16371132/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1350,759,x0,y0,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 20:53:11,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/large-language-models-can-help-home-robots-recover-from-errors-without-human-help/,Large language models can help home robots recover from errors without human help,"Home robots have struggled to gain popularity beyond the Roomba due to various factors such as pricing, practicality, form factor, and mapping. Even when these issues are addressed, there is still the challenge of dealing with mistakes that the robots inevitably make. This is a problem not only on an industrial level but also for consumers who may not have the programming skills or resources to fix these mistakes. However, MIT researchers have found a solution to this problem using large language models (LLMs).

According to a study to be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations, MIT researchers have developed a method to bring ""common sense"" into the process of correcting robot mistakes. Robots are excellent mimics, but they lack the ability to adjust to unexpected situations without being explicitly programmed to do so. Traditionally, when a robot encounters an issue, it exhausts its pre-programmed options before requiring human intervention. This becomes a challenge in unstructured environments like homes, where changes to the environment can affect the robot's ability to function.

Imitation learning, which involves learning to perform tasks through observation, is popular in the field of home robotics. However, it cannot account for the small environmental variations that can interfere with regular operation. The new research addresses this by breaking demonstrations into smaller subsets, rather than treating them as part of a continuous action.

This is where LLMs come in. They eliminate the need for programmers to manually label and assign subactions, as they have the ability to provide instructions for each step of a task in natural language. Grad student Tsun-Hsuan Wang explains, ""A human's continuous demonstration is the embodiment of those steps, in physical space. And we wanted to connect the two, so that a robot would automatically know what stage it is in a task, and be able to replan and recover on its own.""

In the study, the researchers trained a robot to scoop marbles and pour them into an empty bowl. While this task may seem simple for humans, it involves various small tasks for a robot. The LLMs are capable of listing and labeling these subtasks. During the demonstrations, the researchers purposely sabotaged the activity by bumping the robot off course and knocking marbles out of its spoon. However, instead of starting from scratch, the system self-corrected the small tasks.

This method eliminates the need for humans to program or provide additional demonstrations to recover from failures. It allows the robot to learn from its mistakes and continue the task without human intervention. This breakthrough has the potential to make home robots more capable and adaptable in unstructured environments.

In conclusion, MIT researchers have found that using large language models can help robots correct mistakes and adapt to unstructured environments. By breaking tasks into smaller subsets and utilizing natural language instructions, robots can learn to self-correct and continue tasks without human intervention. This research brings us closer to having more capable and efficient home robots that can handle unexpected situations.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/CommonSense-01-press_0.jpg?w=900,2024-03-25 20:01:06,Innovation,Innovation

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-household-robots-common.html,Engineering household robots to have a little common sense,"Robots are becoming increasingly skilled at performing household tasks, from cleaning up spills to serving food. Many of these robots learn through imitation, copying the movements guided by a human. However, robots often struggle to handle unexpected situations unless they are explicitly programmed for every possible scenario. To address this issue, engineers at MIT have developed a method that combines robot motion data with the ""common sense knowledge"" of large language models (LLMs).

The MIT engineers' approach allows robots to logically break down complex tasks into subtasks and adapt to disruptions within those subtasks. This means that robots can continue their tasks without having to start from scratch or rely on engineers to program fixes for every failure. It provides robots with the ability to self-correct errors and improve overall task success.

Yanwei Wang, a graduate student at MIT, explains that blindly mimicking a human's motion trajectories can lead to errors accumulating and derailing the robot's execution. With their new method, robots can adjust their execution based on self-correction, leading to improved task performance.

The researchers will present their approach at the International Conference on Learning Representations in May. The study's co-authors include Tsun-Hsuan Wang, Jiayuan Mao, Michael Hagenow, and Julie Shah.

To illustrate their method, the researchers use the example of scooping marbles from one bowl and pouring them into another. Typically, engineers would demonstrate the task in one continuous motion for the robot to mimic. However, the MIT team realized that tasks actually consist of a sequence of subtasks. For example, the robot needs to reach into the bowl before scooping, scoop up marbles before moving to the empty bowl, and so on.

If a robot makes a mistake during any of these subtasks, it would typically need to start from the beginning unless engineers explicitly label each subtask and program new demonstrations. This level of planning is time-consuming and tedious. Instead, the researchers found that large language models (LLMs) can automatically generate a logical list of subtasks based on their understanding of language.

LLMs are deep learning models that process extensive text libraries. They establish connections between words, sentences, and paragraphs, enabling them to generate new sentences based on what they have learned. The researchers discovered that LLMs can also create a logical list of subtasks for a given task. For example, if asked to list the actions involved in scooping marbles, an LLM might produce a sequence of verbs such as ""reach,"" ""scoop,"" ""transport,"" and ""pour.""

By connecting the natural language labels generated by LLMs with the robot's physical position or state, the MIT team developed an algorithm for grounding. Grounding involves mapping the robot's physical coordinates or image to the natural language label. This algorithm allows the robot to automatically know its stage in a task and replan and recover on its own.

The researchers' new approach provides robots with a form of common sense knowledge that helps them navigate unexpected situations and adjust their actions accordingly. It reduces the need for explicit programming for every possible failure, making robot learning more efficient and adaptable.

In conclusion, MIT engineers have developed a method that combines robot motion data with large language models (LLMs) to enhance robots' ability to handle unexpected situations. By breaking down tasks into subtasks and connecting them with natural language labels, robots can self-correct errors and improve overall task success. This approach reduces the need for explicit programming and enhances the efficiency and adaptability of robot learning.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/engineering-household.jpg,2024-03-25 09:48:20,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/fisker-trading-suspended-by-nyse/,Fisker trading suspended by NYSE,"The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) announced on Monday that it will suspend trading shares of electric vehicle (EV) startup Fisker and is taking steps to remove the company from its stock exchange. The NYSE stated that Fisker's stock is no longer suitable for listing due to abnormally low price levels. This decision comes after Fisker received a warning from the NYSE last month that its stock price had traded below $1 for 30 consecutive days, violating the exchange's rules.

Fisker has the opportunity to review the NYSE's determination, but in a filing made on Monday afternoon, the company stated that it anticipates its stock will be moved to an over-the-counter market, such as OTC Pink. Additionally, Fisker revealed that the delisting has triggered repayment clauses in two outstanding loans, which it is currently unable to afford. This could potentially have a significant negative impact on the business.

The suspension of trading marks the end of a tumultuous day for Fisker, as its shares fell more than 28% before trading was halted. Earlier in the day, Fisker announced the loss of a potential deal with a large automaker, rumored to be Nissan. This development has also jeopardized the company's recent attempt to secure emergency funding.

Fisker did not provide an explanation for why the automaker terminated negotiations, despite it being a critical closing condition for a potential $150 million convertible note that was announced just last week. Fisker stated in its filing that it will request the unnamed investor to waive the closing condition.

Fisker has been facing increasing problems for several months, including customer complaints, lawsuits, and federal investigations. The struggling EV startup has encountered difficulties in selling its Ocean SUV, falling short of its internal sales goals. In an attempt to boost sales, Fisker shifted from a direct sales model to relying on dealerships. However, the company has also faced challenges with quality issues that it has struggled to resolve, according to internal documents.

In February, Fisker laid off 15% of its workforce, which equated to around 200 employees, and recently reported having only $121 million in its bank account. The company has halted production and cautioned investors that it would not survive another year without a fresh injection of capital.

Please note that this story has been updated to include additional details from Fisker's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday afternoon.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fisker-GettyImages.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-25 21:06:18,Innovation,Innovation

When we think of Amazon, we often associate it with package deliveries. However, Amazon is not just a delivery company. It is one of the most innovative companies in the world, investing heavily in infrastructure, supply chain, IT, and transportation.

What many people may not know is that Amazon has been using AI and machine learning in its processes for a long time, even before ""generative AI"" became a popular term. Now, Amazon is taking its AI expertise and bringing it into classrooms and virtual learning experiences.

We had the opportunity to speak with Victor Reinoso, the global director of education philanthropy at Amazon, about the future of education and AI. Reinoso, who previously served as the deputy mayor of Washington D.C., brings a wealth of experience in education and is passionate about preparing students for the careers of the future.

One of the challenges schools face in integrating AI education into their curriculums is the lack of resources and training for teachers. According to a recent survey conducted by Amazon and Access Partnership, 70% of educators lack the resources to teach AI skills, despite 60% believing that these skills should be taught from Grade 6 through university.

To address this education gap, Amazon is funding professional development for teachers and providing free AI tools and curriculum. They have launched initiatives like Hour of Code Dance Party: AI Edition, which introduces coding and generative AI to K-12 students, and AWS Generative AI Scholarships, which provide scholarships for high school and university students to access a new generative AI course on Udacity for free. They are also offering free AI courses for professionals in the workplace.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-semiconductors-scale-processor-remarkable-speedup.html,Semiconductors at scale: New processor achieves remarkable speedup in problem solving,"Annealing processors are a type of technology specifically designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems. These processors are used to find the best solution from a finite set of possibilities, and they have practical implications in various fields such as logistics, resource allocation, and drug discovery.

In a recent study published in IEEE Access, Professor Takayuki Kawahara from Tokyo University of Science and his team have developed a scalable annealing processor that can divide calculations into multiple LSI (Large Scale Integration) chips. This innovative processor was successfully tested and presented at the IEEE 22nd World Symposium on Applied Machine Intelligence and Informatics.

The researchers aimed to achieve advanced information processing directly at the edge, rather than relying on cloud computing or performing preprocessing at the edge. They used a unique processing architecture developed by Tokyo University of Science in 2020 to create a fully coupled LSI on one chip using 28nm CMOS technology. They also devised a scalable method with parallel-operating chips and demonstrated its feasibility using FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) in 2022.

The team's scalable annealing processor consists of 36 22nm CMOS calculation LSI chips and one control FPGA. This technology allows for the construction of large-scale, fully coupled semiconductor systems based on the Ising model, which is a mathematical model of magnetic systems. The processor has 4096 spins and possesses parallelized capabilities for accelerated problem-solving.

One of the key technologies incorporated into the processor is the ""spin thread method,"" which enables eight parallel solution searches. The team also developed a technique that reduces chip requirements by about half compared to conventional methods. In terms of power consumption, the processor operates at 10MHz with a power consumption of 2.9W (1.3W for the core part). The team practically confirmed its performance using a vertex cover problem with 4096 vertices.

In terms of power performance ratio, the processor outperforms simulating a fully coupled Ising system on a PC using annealing emulation by 2,306 times. It also surpasses the core CPU and arithmetic chip by 2,186 times.

The successful machine verification of this scalable annealing processor suggests the possibility of enhanced capacity. Prof. Kawahara envisions the social implementation of this technology, including initiating a business, joint research, and technology transfer. He aims to develop this technology for an LSI system with the computing power of a 2050-level quantum computer for solving combinatorial optimization problems. The goal is to achieve this without the need for air conditioning, large equipment, or cloud infrastructure using current semiconductor processes. The team aims to achieve 2 million spins by 2030 and explore the creation of new digital industries using this technology.

To summarize, the researchers have developed a scalable, fully coupled annealing processor with 4096 spins on a single board using 36 CMOS chips. Key innovations, including chip reduction and parallel operations for simultaneous solution searches, have played a crucial role in this development.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/profluent-spurred-by-salesforce-research-and-backed-by-jeff-dean-uses-ai-to-discover-medicines/,"Profluent, spurred by Salesforce research and backed by Jeff Dean, uses AI to discover medicines","Last year, Salesforce embarked on a project called ProGen, utilizing generative AI to design proteins. The goal was to uncover medical treatments more efficiently and cost-effectively than traditional methods. While the project showed promise in creating artificial protein structures, it didn't progress much commercially. However, one of the researchers, Ali Madani, has now launched a company called Profluent to bring this protein-generating technology to pharmaceutical companies.

Madani's mission with Profluent is to reverse the drug development paradigm by starting with patient and therapeutic needs and working backward to create customized treatments. Proteins, such as enzymes and antibodies, play a crucial role in many drugs. By using generative AI models, data about proteins can be used to predict entirely new proteins with novel functions. Profluent aims to take this concept further by applying it to gene editing, particularly for genetic diseases that can't be fixed by proteins lifted directly from nature.

Other companies and research groups have also demonstrated the potential of generative AI in predicting proteins. Nvidia released a generative AI model called MegaMolBART, which searches for potential drug targets and forecasts chemical reactions. Meta trained a model called ESM-2 on protein sequences to predict sequences for millions of proteins. Additionally, DeepMind's AlphaFold system predicts complete protein structures with remarkable speed and accuracy.

Profluent is training AI models on massive datasets containing over 40 billion protein sequences to create and fine-tune gene-editing and protein-producing systems. Rather than developing treatments itself, the startup plans to collaborate with external partners to produce genetic medicines with the highest chances of approval. This approach has the potential to significantly reduce the time and capital typically required for treatment development, which currently takes an average of 10-15 years and costs several hundred million to billions of dollars.

Profluent, based in Berkeley and consisting of 20 employees, has received backing from prominent venture capitalists such as Spark Capital, Insight Partners, Air Street Capital, AIX Ventures, and Convergent Ventures. Google's chief scientist, Jeff Dean, has also contributed to the platform, adding credibility to the company. Profluent's immediate focus is on upgrading its AI models by expanding the training data sets and acquiring customers and partners. As competitors like EvolutionaryScale and Basecamp Research also develop their own protein-generating models, Profluent aims to scale and collaborate with partners to achieve its ambitious goals for the future.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1288172035.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-25 22:08:51,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/03/25/3-motivations-behind-cosplaying-according-to-a-psychologist/,"3 Motivations Behind â€˜Cosplaying,â€™ According To A Psychologist","Cosplay: Discovering Identity, Escaping Reality, and Building Community

If you've ever donned a costume for Halloween, you've likely experienced the thrill of temporarily becoming someone else, even if just for a night. However, for some people, dressing up as fictional characters is more than just a once-a-year event. It's a lifestyle, a passion, and an art form. Welcome to the world of cosplay.

Cosplay, short for ""costume play,"" is a vibrant subculture where individuals immerse themselves in the worlds of their favorite media franchises. From comic books and anime to movies and video games, cosplayers bring their beloved characters to life through elaborate costumes, makeup, and accessories. But what drives people to embrace this captivating form of self-expression? Let's explore three compelling reasons based on research.

1. Creative Self-Expression: Unleashing Your Inner Superhero

Authentic self-expression is closely linked to life satisfaction, and cosplay provides a unique outlet for creative expression. It allows individuals to celebrate their favorite fandoms, express their passion for fictional characters, and explore different facets of their identity. By embodying various characters, cosplayers can experiment with personas and aspects of themselves that they may not feel comfortable expressing in their everyday lives.

A study published in the journal Fashion Theory delved into the cosplay subculture in Hong Kong and found that the ability to shift identities plays a key role in pursuing cosplay. Cosplay enthusiasts described the experience as transforming from an ordinary person to a superhero or from adulthood to childhood. It's a chance to recapture a sense of innocent joy from their childhoods.

For cosplayers like Po Yin, the experience is empowering. ""Being a cosplayer, I can transform myself into many different charactersâ€”a heroine, a cute little girl, or even a beautiful boy,"" Yin explains. It's an opportunity to take on new roles, boost confidence, and fulfill dreams.

2. Escaping Reality: Stepping into a World of Wonder

In a world filled with stress and uncertainty, the allure of escaping reality is undeniable. Cosplay offers a temporary reprieve from everyday life, allowing cosplayers to immerse themselves in the shoes of beloved characters. By transporting themselves to fantastical worlds, cosplayers experience a sense of adventure, excitement, and wonder that may be lacking in their mundane routines.

A 2018 study found that escapism was one of the strongest motivations behind cosplay. It provides an avenue for young people to dream, find pleasure, romance, and indulge in fantasies that may not be fulfilled in their daily lives. For a brief moment, cosplayers can feel like stars or celebrities. They seek recognition, admiration, and the opportunity to be photographed.

3. A Sense of Community: Finding Belonging

Beyond the allure of escapism, cosplay fosters a sense of community. The need to belong is a fundamental human desire, and cosplay conventions and gatherings serve as communal spaces where like-minded individuals can come together to share their passion. These events create opportunities for lasting friendships to form and provide a sense of acceptance and belonging.

In the same 2018 study, researchers discovered that ""belongingness"" was one of the strongest motivations behind cosplaying. Cosplayers find solace in connecting with others who understand their unique interests and experiences. They revel in the chance to meet fellow enthusiasts, exchange ideas, showcase their creativity, and celebrate their shared love for the art of cosplay.

In Conclusion: Embracing the Power of Cosplay

Cosplay is more than just dressing up in elaborate costumes. It's a powerful form of self-expression, a means of escaping reality, and an avenue for building connections with others. Through cosplay, individuals can explore different facets of their identity, experience the thrill of embodying beloved characters, and find a community that embraces and celebrates their passion.

So, whether you're a fan of superheroes, anime, or video games, consider taking that step into the world of cosplay. Embrace your favorite character, unleash your creativity, and discover the best version of yourself by becoming someone else, if only for a little while.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6601ac3a0b7231e5ced958f7/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2613,1224,x0,y80,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 19:30:41,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/bankrupt-ev-startup-arrival-sold-its-assets-to-canoo/,Bankrupt EV startup Arrival sold its assets to Canoo,"Bankrupt electric vehicle (EV) startup Arrival has sold some of its assets, including advanced manufacturing equipment, to struggling startup Canoo. This acquisition is seen as a cost-saving measure for Canoo, as it aims to move beyond prototypes and into commercial production. Canoo plans to send the purchased assets to its facility in Oklahoma. It is unclear if Canoo also acquired any of Arrival's intellectual property (IP).

Arrival, once valued at over $13 billion and backed by Hyundai and UPS, announced in January that it would sell off assets and IP from its U.K. division after filing for bankruptcy protection. The company had ambitious plans to revolutionize EV production with compact ""microfactories"" located in city centers. However, these plans fell apart as Arrival faced financial difficulties and underwent multiple restructurings.

Canoo, on the other hand, faced its own struggles after going public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company. The company's unique EV design, based on a ""skateboard"" architecture, garnered attention but production challenges hindered progress. Although Canoo reported having more than $1 billion in its sales pipeline, it has struggled to convert these sales into deliveries. The company has had to resort to stock splits and issuing more shares to stay afloat.

Despite their challenges, both Arrival and Canoo continue to navigate the EV industry. The sale of assets from Arrival to Canoo provides an opportunity for Canoo to bolster its production capabilities and potentially accelerate its path to commercialization. However, the success of these efforts remains uncertain.

As the EV market continues to evolve and competition increases, startups like Arrival and Canoo face significant hurdles. Financial stability, production scalability, and delivery reliability are crucial factors that will determine their long-term success. Only time will tell if these companies can overcome their respective challenges and establish themselves as key players in the electric vehicle industry.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/canoo-walmart-arkansas.jpg?resize=1200,670",2024-03-25 22:15:20,Innovation,Innovation
