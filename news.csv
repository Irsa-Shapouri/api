However, despite its planned end-of-life date in February 2024, the app has continued to function. In a surprising turn of events, Systrom and Krieger have decided to keep Artifact alive for the time being and are exploring options to maintain the app in the future.

Systrom revealed that running the app requires fewer resources than they initially anticipated. Currently, it is being managed solely by Systrom and Krieger. While Artifact may still eventually disappear, the founders are considering all possible routes for its future. This news brings hope to fans of the news discovery app, who may see a potential for the app to be saved through an exit deal.

Artifact made a significant impact upon its launch, not only because it was the first major effort from Instagram's co-founders but also due to its innovative use of AI. The app utilized AI to help users discover news tailored to their interests from a range of trusted sources. It also offered features that summarized news in different styles, such as ""Gen Z"" or ""Explain Like I'm Five."" Additionally, it had the ability to rewrite clickbait headlines for better clarity.

After Artifact announced its impending closure, interest in AI-powered news summarization grew. Arc, a browser startup, incorporated an AI-powered ""pinch to summarize"" feature before raising $50 million in funding. Other startups, including Feeeed, Bulletin, and Particle, have also utilized AI to enhance the news reading experience. The fact that Particle recently secured $4.4 million in seed funding indicates the increasing interest from investors in this field.

Unlike its early version, the current iteration of Artifact has removed its social features, such as commenting and posting. However, it still offers news reading and AI summarization features.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Product_Shot.jpeg?w=1200,2024-03-26 16:42:39,Innovation,Innovation
