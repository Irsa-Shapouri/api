https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-liquid-iron-battery-grid-energy.html,New all-liquid iron flow battery for grid energy storage,"A Battery Made with Common Chemicals Could Revolutionize Large-Scale Energy Storage

Researchers at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have developed a new battery design that repurposes a commonplace chemical used in water treatment facilities. This design offers a safe, economical, and water-based solution for large-scale energy storage, providing another avenue for incorporating intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar power into the electric grid.

The team reported in Nature Communications that their lab-scale, iron-based battery demonstrated exceptional cycling stability, maintaining 98.7% of its maximum capacity over one thousand consecutive charging cycles. In comparison, previous studies on similar batteries reported a degradation of charge capacity two orders of magnitude higher over fewer charging cycles.

While iron-based flow batteries have been in existence since the 1980s, this battery stands out due to its unique liquid chemical formula. It combines charged iron with a neutral-pH phosphate-based liquid electrolyte called nitrogenous triphosphonate, or NTMPA. What makes NTMPA particularly promising is its availability in industrial quantities, as it is commonly used to inhibit corrosion in water treatment plants.

Phosphonates, including NTMPA, are a broad chemical family based on phosphorus. Many phosphonates dissolve well in water and are widely used in fertilizers and detergents. NTMPA's availability and water solubility make it an ideal candidate for large-scale energy storage.

Flow batteries, as the name suggests, consist of two chambers filled with different liquids. These batteries charge through an electrochemical reaction and store energy in chemical bonds. When connected to an external circuit, they release that energy to power electrical devices. Unlike conventional batteries, flow batteries feature two external supply tanks of liquid that constantly circulate through them, serving as the battery system's ""blood supply."" The larger the electrolyte supply tank, the more energy the flow battery can store.

Flow batteries are vital for modernizing the U.S. electric grid and enabling the storage of energy from renewable sources. They can serve as backup generators and are a key component of decarbonization strategies. One of their advantages is scalability, as they can be built at any scale, from small lab-bench experiments to city block-sized systems.

In the short term, grid operators are seeking to deploy battery energy storage systems (BESS) in urban or suburban areas close to energy consumers. However, safety concerns often arise when constructing these facilities. The aqueous flow battery developed by the research team could help address these concerns.

""A BESS facility using the chemistry similar to what we have developed here would have the advantage of operating in water at neutral pH,"" said Aaron Hollas, a study author and team leader in PNNL's Battery Materials and Systems Group. ""In addition, our system uses commercially available reagents that haven't been previously investigated for use in flow batteries.""

The team reported that their initial design can achieve an energy density of up to 9 watt-hours per liter (Wh/L). While commercialized vanadium-based systems are more than twice as energy dense at 25 Wh/L, a battery built with Earth-abundant materials could be scaled to provide the same energy output in a smaller footprint.

This breakthrough in battery design opens up exciting possibilities for large-scale energy storage. By repurposing a common chemical and utilizing Earth-abundant materials, researchers have developed a safe, economical, and water-based solution that can help integrate renewable energy sources into the electric grid. With further development and optimization, flow batteries could play a crucial role in modernizing our energy infrastructure and transitioning to a greener future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/new-all-liquid-iron-fl.jpg,2024-03-25 07:22:25,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/techcrunch-mobility-the-wheels-are-starting-to-come-off-the-fisker-ev-bus/,TechCrunch Mobility: The wheels are starting to come off the Fisker EV bus,"TechCrunch Mobility is a newsletter focused on transportation news and insights. In this week's edition, we discuss the recent proposed standards from the Biden Administration, Uber's first investment in Africa, Apple's antitrust suit extending to cars, and DoorDash's partnership with Wing for drone delivery. Let's dive in!

The Biden Administration has released two new proposed standards that will impact U.S. automakers and consumers. The Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have both issued regulations that are stricter than previous standards but have been softened to address concerns from the automotive industry. The DOE's proposal introduces a ""petroleum equivalency factor"" to the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards, making it easier for automakers to meet the requirements. The EPA's proposal sets stiffer tailpipe standards for 2027 to 2032 model year vehicles but allows automakers to meet them using various powertrains. This technology-agnostic approach provides flexibility and is less stringent than the original proposal. While these standards have implications for legacy automakers, they have little impact on EV startups like Rivian, Tesla, and Lucid, whose vehicles already meet the clean car standards.

In other news, Uber has made its first investment in an Africa-founded startup. Moove, a mobility fintech company based in Africa, raised $100 million in a Series B funding round led by Uber. Moove offers vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers and is valued at $750 million. This investment aligns with Uber's commitment to a fully zero-emission fleet by 2040, as Moove has made EVs a significant part of its business strategy.

Additionally, Apple's antitrust lawsuit has extended to the automotive industry. The lawsuit alleges that Apple has engaged in anti-competitive behavior by restricting third-party apps on its devices, including CarPlay. This development highlights the increasing importance of software and digital services in the automotive sector.

In the world of delivery services, DoorDash has partnered with Wing for drone delivery. Wing, a subsidiary of Alphabet, will use its autonomous delivery drones to transport orders from DoorDash. This partnership aims to enhance the efficiency and speed of food delivery, especially in areas with challenging traffic conditions.

Now, let's move on to some exciting startup news. Clevon, a company specializing in autonomous delivery technology, was rumored to be on the verge of shutting down. However, the company's CEO, Sander Sebastian Agur, has confirmed that Clevon is still operational and has entered into an exclusivity agreement for a merger with an American electric vehicle company. While details are scarce, this development indicates a potential positive outcome for Clevon.

In the deal of the week, Amber, a startup that offers aftermarket Tesla extended warranties, raised $3.18 million in a seed round. The funding will support the expansion of Amber's warranty product and further develop its business.

Another notable deal is Candela, an electric boat maker that raised $25 million in a funding round led by Groupe Beneteau. Candela aims to revolutionize the boating industry with its electric hydrofoiling boats, which offer a quiet and eco-friendly boating experience.

Lastly, Pelikan Mobility, a French startup developing electric mobility solutions, has raised €5 million in funding. The company focuses on providing sustainable transportation options for businesses and individuals.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-deep-geothermal-renewable-powerhouse.html,Dig deep: US bets on geothermal to become renewable powerhouse,"Geothermal energy has the potential to become a major player in the green energy transition, despite currently accounting for a small fraction of US energy production. The US government, along with various businesses and President Joe Biden's administration, is investing in technological advancements to harness the power of geothermal energy and make it more accessible and reliable.

Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm emphasized the benefits of geothermal energy at the CERAWeek conference in Houston. By utilizing the heat beneath our feet, geothermal energy can provide clean and scalable power to industries and households alike. Granholm's department predicts that geothermal energy could surpass hydroelectric and solar power in the US by 2050.

In 2022, geothermal energy accounted for only 1.6 percent of US energy consumption. To boost production, the US government has invested over $200 million since 2018 in an experimental site in Utah. This site focuses on Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), a technology that involves drilling exceptionally deep wells and injecting water into naturally hot rocks. This approach differs from traditional geothermal methods, which rely on hot springs or underground reservoirs.

EGS offers several advantages. It reduces the upfront risk associated with drilling, as it can be done anywhere and does not require the presence of a nearby hot spring. Additionally, the US government is simplifying the permit conversion process, allowing companies to convert permits for oil or gas exploration into geothermal licenses, which streamlines the transition process.

Furthermore, geothermal drilling has environmental benefits compared to hydraulic fracturing (fracking) for oil and gas extraction. Geothermal drilling uses fewer chemical additives and does not release hydrocarbons. Unlike solar and wind power, geothermal energy provides a consistent flow of energy regardless of weather conditions or the time of day.

Cost-wise, the US government estimates that geothermal energy will become more affordable, dropping from $70 to $100 per megawatt hour (MWh) to $45 by 2035. The use of existing drilling technology makes geothermal development quicker and cheaper. This new application of drilling technology has unlocked the potential of geothermal energy and positioned the US as a leader in the field.

While the US has been at the forefront of geothermal technology, other countries, including France, have also experimented with EGS. However, the risk of inducing seismic activity, similar to fracking, remains a concern. The US Energy Department mandates mitigation protocols for all funded projects to address induced seismicity and is actively funding research on the issue.

The geothermal energy market is attracting significant interest from start-ups in the US and Canada, with substantial investments from various investors. Fervo Energy, for example, partnered with Google to develop a geothermal site in Nevada. As demand for geothermal energy grows, major companies like Google, Microsoft, and Nucor are committing to purchasing geothermal energy, signaling the private sector's enthusiasm for this renewable energy source.

Cindy Taff, CEO of Sage Geosystems, believes that the geothermal energy market is still open for new or next-generation players. The industry needs its first successful commercial facility to demonstrate the viability of geothermal energy and encourage further investment and development.

In conclusion, geothermal energy has the potential to play a significant role in the green energy transition. The US government's investments and technological advancements in Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) are paving the way for increased geothermal energy production. With its environmental benefits, reliability, and scalability, geothermal energy can become a key contributor to the US energy mix in the coming decades. By unlocking the potential of geothermal energy, we can move closer to a cleaner and more sustainable future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/a-worker-operates-a-dr.jpg,2024-03-25 04:59:03,Innovation,Innovation

The company, which helps other companies launch and manage credit cards, has been impacted by the turmoil in the crypto industry. Despite being valued at $500 million in 2021 and having high-profile investors like Goldman Sachs, Visa, Mastercard, and Accel, Deserve is now exploring options, including selling itself, as it grapples with financial difficulties.

Deserve, founded in 2013, has raised $150 million in equity funding but is not yet profitable. It reportedly burned through $15 million to $20 million in 2023. However, the company's founder and CEO, Kalpesh Kapadia, remains optimistic about the future and expects strong growth this year. Deserve aims to become a self-sustaining and profitable business by reducing its burn rate and focusing on building partnerships, investments, and mergers and acquisitions.

If Deserve is sold, industry insiders anticipate that it will be for less than half of its peak valuation in 2021. The decline in fintech valuations and the company's specific challenges, such as the bankruptcy of its largest customer, crypto lender BlockFi, have contributed to the expected decrease in value.

Kapadia, who immigrated to the US from India in the mid-1990s, founded Deserve after working in finance for 15 years. Originally, he envisioned the company as a consumer credit card provider targeting immigrants and students, aiming to make credit more accessible to underserved populations. However, consumer lending proved to be a difficult and capital-intensive business. In 2018, Deserve pivoted to focus on helping other companies launch credit cards. This shift allowed Deserve to simplify the process for customers by handling various aspects, such as assessing borrower risk, processing transactions, and providing customer service.

Deserve has worked with a range of customers, including student loan bank Sallie Mae and the University of Notre Dame. It has also collaborated with fintech companies like Vertical Finance and M1, as well as traditional banks like Customers Bank. However, the challenges faced by its customers, such as GloriFi, have impacted Deserve's business. The closure of startups and the freeze in the funding market have added to the company's difficulties.

Competition in the tech-enabled credit card issuing space has intensified over the past year. Marqeta, a publicly traded payments company, announced its acquisition of Power Finance, indicating the growing competition in the market.

These investigations were announced less than three weeks after the compliance deadline for these companies. The three gatekeepers were designated under the pan-EU market power and contestability regulation last fall and now face formal investigation to determine if they are breaching the rulebook.

Violations of the DMA can result in fines of up to 10% of global annual turnover, or even 20% for repeat offenses. The EU will have up to 12 months to conclude the investigations, with a preliminary report expected within six months.

This enforcement action by the EU comes as antitrust scrutiny on these three US firms continues to increase on their home turf as well. There has been criticism that their compliance plans do not fully comply with the new EU law.

Google has been accused of circumventing the regulation's ban on self-preferencing by introducing new rich features in search results that unfairly compete with rivals. Apple's use of notifications to warn users of risks outside its ecosystem has been criticized as ""scare screens"" by developers. Meta's ""pay or be tracked"" tactic has also faced condemnation from privacy and consumer rights groups.

The Commission has opened proceedings to assess whether Alphabet and Apple's measures regarding their app stores are in breach of the DMA. The Commission is concerned that these companies' steering measures impose various restrictions and limitations on app developers' ability to freely communicate and promote offers.

Concerning Google's self-preferencing, the investigation will focus on Google's vertical search services and the potential impact on similar rival services. The Commission is concerned that Alphabet's measures may not ensure fair treatment of third-party services in comparison to its own services.

On Apple, the EU will examine whether the company is complying with user choice obligations on iOS, such as enabling easy uninstallation of apps and changing default settings. The EU will also assess the effectiveness of choice screens that allow users to select alternative default services.

Regarding Meta, the proceedings will investigate whether its ""pay or consent"" model for EU users complies with the DMA. The Commission is concerned that this model may not provide a real alternative for users who do not consent, thereby failing to prevent the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers.

In response to questions about these investigations, the EU's internal market commissioner emphasized the DMA's requirement for gatekeepers to offer free, non-discriminatory access to their services.

These investigations mark a significant step in the EU's efforts to regulate Big Tech companies and ensure fair competition in the digital market. The outcomes of these probes will have far-reaching implications for the future of these companies and the digital landscape as a whole.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1031626648.jpg?resize=1200,799",2024-03-25 12:10:10,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/gostudent-tutoring-profitability/,"GoStudent, the online learning platform, says it's now profitable","GoStudent, an online tutoring marketplace based in Vienna, Austria, has established itself as one of the leading startups in the country. With a valuation of $3.2 billion, GoStudent boasts 11 million families and 23,000 tutors on its platform. In addition to this achievement, the company has recently announced its profitability. CEO Felix Ohswald revealed that GoStudent is not only EBITDA positive but also has positive operating cash flow globally.

GoStudent's success is noteworthy, considering the challenges it faced along the way. The online learning market experienced a crash, affecting many technology companies, including GoStudent. Despite years of aggressive scaling, the company encountered a significant decline in customer demand, resulting in a critical situation. In 2021, GoStudent recorded a loss of €89 million, which increased to €220 million in 2022. Consequently, the company had to implement cost-cutting measures and undergo several rounds of layoffs.

GoStudent's CEO, Felix Ohswald, described the company's growth as ""crazy"" hyperscaling. Within a span of two years, GoStudent achieved over €100 million in revenue, but it also incurred a cash burn of over €150 million in 2022 alone. As the market conditions changed, GoStudent realized that it could not sustain this level of expenditure. In 2023, the company reduced its burn rate by 70%, but it was still insufficient. Ohswald acknowledged the need for restructuring and the importance of scaling strategically.

The COVID-19 pandemic brought about a digital transformation, and edtech companies like GoStudent thrived in this environment. Initially, GoStudent had to convince parents of the benefits of online tutoring. However, it quickly became a go-to solution for schoolchildren in need of educational assistance. Despite this favorable sentiment, GoStudent had to address its financial challenges. The company implemented various cost-cutting measures, such as eliminating extravagant parties, halting acquisitions, and refraining from entering new markets where online tutoring was not well-established.

To achieve sustainable growth, GoStudent decided to refocus on Europe instead of aiming to expand to 20 countries. The company adopted a more organic growth strategy outside of German-speaking countries. GoStudent's former chief growth officer, Laura Warnier, was replaced by a chief marketing officer, Dan Zbijowski, signaling a shift from top-line growth to bottom-line growth.

Balancing cost reduction and growth will be a challenge for GoStudent. The company's mission is to become the number one global school and provide personalized tutoring to every student. While scaling at lower costs may pose difficulties in maintaining a personalized approach, GoStudent aims to evolve its offering. The acquisition of StudienKreis in 2022, a company with physical learning centers in Germany, allows GoStudent to expand its hybrid learning approach. CEO Felix Ohswald believes that the future of education is hybrid, combining technology with physical learning centers.

GoStudent's tutors primarily consist of university students, making it easier for them to connect with their pupils. This younger demographic enhances the tutoring experience and allows for personalized interactions. GoStudent's goal is to leverage technology to match each student with the most suitable tutor, regardless of their location.

In conclusion, GoStudent has overcome significant challenges to achieve profitability. The company has adapted its strategy to focus on organic growth in Europe and is embracing hybrid learning through the acquisition of StudienKreis. With its mission to provide personalized tutoring to students worldwide, GoStudent aims to strike a balance between cost reduction and growth. As the online tutoring market continues to evolve, GoStudent remains committed to unlocking the potential of every student.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Founders-of-GoStudent-Gregor-Muller-I-Felix-Ohswald-2.jpg?w=1024,2024-03-25 11:00:36,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelicamarideoliveira/2024/03/25/felipe-meneses-is-the-first-brazilian-thiel-fellow/,Felipe Meneses Is The First Brazilian Thiel Fellow,"Felipe Meneses, a young tech entrepreneur from Brazil, is making waves as the first Latin Thiel Fellow to join the prestigious program. Established by billionaire Peter Thiel in 2011, the Thiel Fellowship awards $100,000 to individuals who choose to forgo college and instead start their own companies. Meneses, hailing from the northeastern state of Sergipe, made the bold decision to abandon his undergraduate studies at Stanford University and has now been selected for the 2024 intake of the two-year acceleration program.

Meneses, at just 23 years old, co-founded Hyperplane in 2022 alongside Felipe Lamounier, Daniel Silva, and Rohan Ramanath. Hyperplane is a data intelligence firm that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to assist banks in utilizing their data to enhance customer experiences through a hyper-personalization approach. With its headquarters in Silicon Valley, the company originated in Brazil and boasts contracts with 12 of the country's leading financial institutions. Hyperplane has already secured a substantial investment of 30 million reais ($6 million) from notable backers such as Lachy Groom, SV Angel, Clocktower Technology Ventures, Liquid2 Ventures, Soma Capital, Latitud, Atman Capital, Crestone VC, and Norte. In addition, the company has been selected to participate in Endeavor's Scale-UP acceleration program in the first half of 2024.

Meneses's achievement is particularly noteworthy as he is the sole Latin American founder to be selected for the Thiel Fellowship this year. In fact, in 2023, there were no entrepreneurs from the region included in the fellowship either. However, Latin names have made appearances in the list of previous Thiel Fellows. For instance, the 2022 cohort featured Ian Lee, the founder of Examedi, a healthtech startup based in Chile. Examedi facilitates patient access to healthcare by connecting them with available healthcare providers. Another Latin founder from the 2022 cohort is Tamara Chaya Romo, a Mexican entrepreneur leading MEDU, a company focused on developing reusable personal protective equipment.

The Thiel Fellowship has become a renowned platform for young innovators to pursue their entrepreneurial dreams without the traditional college path. By providing financial support and mentorship, the fellowship empowers these individuals to take risks and create impactful companies. Meneses's inclusion as a Thiel Fellow not only highlights his individual achievement but also showcases the growing potential of Latin American entrepreneurs in the global tech landscape.

As the only Latin Thiel Fellow in 2024, Meneses exemplifies the spirit of innovation and determination that the fellowship fosters. His story serves as an inspiration to aspiring entrepreneurs, proving that with passion, tenacity, and a unique vision, anyone can make their mark in the startup world. With Hyperplane's success and the recognition it has garnered from both the Brazilian and international investment communities, Meneses is poised to make a significant impact on the future of data intelligence and AI-driven solutions.

The Thiel Fellowship continues to shape the future of entrepreneurship by supporting individuals who dare to challenge the status quo. As the program evolves and attracts talent from diverse backgrounds, it is becoming an even more influential force in the startup ecosystem. Meneses's journey from abandoning his college education to becoming a Thiel Fellow is a testament to the possibilities that await those who are willing to take risks and pursue their passions. We are excited to see what lies ahead for Meneses, Hyperplane, and the entire Latin American tech community as they continue to push boundaries and drive innovation on a global scale.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66019447ce2364c0c92ae041/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 11:13:47,Innovation,Innovation
