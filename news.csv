Previously, Grok was only available to Premium+ subscribers, but now it will be accessible to all Premium subscribers as well. This move could be seen as an attempt to compete with other popular chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude. However, it may also be a strategy to boost the number of subscribers on the platform. Recent data shows a decline in X usage in the US, with a decrease of 18% year-over-year as of February. Additionally, Musk's decision to remove advertisements from the platform seems to have affected its revenue potential, as many top advertisers have stopped spending their budget on X.

By offering access to an AI chatbot like Grok, X hopes to retain its users and prevent them from migrating to other platforms such as Mastodon, Bluesky, or Instagram's Threads. These platforms have gained popularity, especially Threads, which has benefited from Meta's resources and has reached over 130 million monthly users as of the fourth quarter of 2023.

While Musk did not provide a specific date for when Grok will be available to X users, he mentioned that it will be enabled for all Premium subscribers later this week. X Premium is the mid-tier subscription option, priced at $8 per month or $84 per year on the web. Previously, Grok was only accessible to Premium+ subscribers, who paid $16 per month or $168 per year.

Grok's chatbot is expected to appeal to Musk's followers and avid X users. It will be able to respond to questions about topics that are typically off-limits to other AI chatbots, such as conspiracies or controversial political ideas. One of Grok's distinguishing features is its ability to access real-time X data, which sets it apart from its competitors.

However, the value of this data could be diminishing if X continues to lose users. It remains to be seen whether offering Grok to more subscribers will be enough to reverse the decline in X's user base.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/xAI-Grok-GettyImages-1765893916.jpeg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-26 22:19:50,Innovation,Innovation
