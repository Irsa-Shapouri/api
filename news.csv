Valorant Masters Madrid recently showcased Riot Games' newest addition to the game, Clove, a remarkable agent with unique abilities. As the 25th agent to join the Valorant roster, Clove brings a fresh perspective to the game and promises an exciting gameplay experience. Let's delve into Clove's abilities and discover what makes them stand out from the rest.

Clove, classified as a controller, excels in disrupting enemies and providing utility for their team. However, what truly sets them apart is their ability to come back from the dead, making them a force to be reckoned with. With their upcoming release in the next Valorant patch on March 26, players can look forward to exploring the full potential of this intriguing agent.

One of Clove's abilities is Ruse, activated by pressing the E key. Ruse is a smoke ability similar to that of Brimstone's. By bringing up a small window on the screen, players can select a top-down view of their current location on the map. From there, they can strategically drop smoke to obstruct enemy vision. What makes Ruse even more unique is its usability even after Clove's demise, adding an unexpected dimension to their gameplay.

Next up is Clove's Q ability, Meddle, a throwable grenade-like weapon. Upon impact, Meddle inflicts decay on all enemies hit by it. While this ability may seem less impactful compared to others, it should not be underestimated as its potential to disrupt enemy movements can prove invaluable in certain situations.

Clove's C ability, Pick-Me-Up, bears similarities to Reyna's kit. After eliminating an enemy, Clove can absorb their life essence, granting them haste and a temporary health boost. Although not the most groundbreaking ability, it adds to Clove's versatility and survivability in intense confrontations.

However, it is Clove's ultimate ability that truly steals the show. When Clove dies with their ultimate ability ready, they have the opportunity to quickly cast it and come back to life for a short period. If Clove manages to secure a kill or contribute to damaging an opponent during this resurrection phase, they will be fully revived, as though they never perished. However, failure to achieve this will result in returning to the grave once the resurrection timer expires.

What makes Clove particularly appealing is their ability to remain useful even after being taken down. Their ultimate allows them to return to the battlefield with renewed vigor, while their C ability provides additional health upon revival. Furthermore, the smokes that can be deployed even after death make Clove an excellent entry fragger, significantly reducing the risk of dying.

Dan Hardison, the agent gameplay designer on Valorant, emphasizes the importance of playing with fire when using Clove. Taking risks and sacrificing one's life for the greater good is a fundamental aspect of optimal Clove gameplay. By eliminating opponents and removing enemy utility from the round, players can achieve success with Clove. Unlike other controllers, Clove's raw execute utility may be weaker, but their ability to contribute post-death sets them apart. Players should embrace the idea of fighting to the death rather than retreating. In fact, Clove can even benefit from trading their life for that of an opponent. A 1-for-1 exchange works in Clove's favor, showcasing the agent's unique playstyle. To truly excel with Clove, players must be prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice for the team.

In conclusion, Clove brings an exciting and innovative gameplay experience to Valorant. With their disruptive abilities and the ability to come back from the dead, Clove is a formidable agent that demands attention. Whether you choose to utilize their smoke abilities, inflict decay on enemies, or strategically revive yourself, Clove is undoubtedly a force to be reckoned with. So, embrace the thrill of playing with fire and unleash the full potential of Clove!",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff3fefa4d4cfc35a9fc1fe/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 11:15:00,Innovation,Innovation

She and I were invited to speak to a group of students by the East Suburban Atlanta Chapter of Jack and Jill of America, Inc. The purpose of the event was to inspire and encourage young Black students to pursue careers in STEM fields.

As an atmospheric scientist, I have always been passionate about weather and climate. Growing up as an only child with a single mother, I spent a lot of time exploring nature and observing the weather. My early interests in entomology and stream ecology eventually led me to focus on weather and meteorology. I remember doing my sixth-grade science project on weather and being fascinated by the ""how's and why's"" of it all.

Although there were no scientists in my immediate circle, I was inspired by the work of Dr. George Washington Carver. My mother, an alumna of Tuskegee Institute (now University), introduced me to his accomplishments as an agricultural scientist. Reading about his innovative work with peanuts sparked my curiosity and motivated me to understand the scientific aspects of weather. Dr. Carver became my first mentor, even though I never had the opportunity to meet him in person.

During my youth, it was uncommon to see Black students pursuing STEM careers. Sadly, this is still the case today. A recent study by the Pew Center revealed that positive perceptions about STEM within the Black American community are low. The study also highlighted the lack of visible examples of Black achievement in STEM fields as a deterrent for aspiring Black scientists.

Furthermore, the study found that STEM fields can feel unwelcoming for certain racial groups and women. As the former president of the American Meteorological Society, I have personally witnessed and experienced this lack of inclusivity. It is crucial to address these barriers and create a more welcoming environment for underrepresented groups in STEM.

To strengthen inclusivity in the STEM ecosystem, we must increase the visibility of achievements from diverse groups. Encouraging and sustaining mentorship programs can also play a significant role in inspiring and supporting aspiring scientists. Additionally, we need to challenge cultural perceptions of successful careers and highlight the opportunities and impact of STEM professions. Retention efforts are equally important to ensure that students and professionals feel supported and motivated to continue their STEM journeys. Finally, it is essential to emphasize that diversity in ideas and perspectives leads to better scientific research and development.

The event I attended this weekend was a powerful reminder of the importance of engaging with young students and inspiring them to pursue their passions in STEM. Dr. Pearl Dowe and I had the opportunity to share our experiences and encourage the students to explore the vast possibilities within the field of science. By nurturing their interests and providing them with guidance and support, we hope to contribute to a future where Black scientists are not the exception, but the norm.

In conclusion, as an atmospheric scientist, I am passionate about promoting diversity and inclusivity in STEM fields. My own journey in science has been shaped by mentors and role models who inspired me to pursue my dreams. By increasing visibility, fostering mentorship, challenging cultural perceptions, and prioritizing inclusivity, we can create a more equitable and thriving STEM ecosystem. It is my hope that more young Black students will be encouraged to explore the wonders of science and contribute their unique perspectives to the scientific community.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660034c3235190ae18aa9cf0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 11:18:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/technology/article/what-are-rpg-games/,What Is A Role-Playing Game? RPG Types Explained,"Role-playing games (RPGs) hold different meanings for different people. Some envision RPGs as tabletop games where friends gather to roll dice and weave stories together. Others see RPGs as interactive experiences with character development, intricate storylines, and discussions about different game outcomes. Whether you're a seasoned RPG player or someone new to the genre, this guide will introduce you to the most common types of RPGs, helping you find the right game to explore or expand your horizons.

What Are Role-Playing Games?

RPGs allow players to assume the role of a character within a game that unfolds like a story. The choices players make throughout the game influence their character's development and shape the direction of the story. Sometimes, the story is controlled by a computer, while other times, it's controlled by another player.

The typical structure of an RPG involves players embodying a single character. They have the freedom to customize their character's appearance, behavior, and abilities within the context of the story. Characters remain integral to the story until they die, are removed by a game element, or when a player wishes to switch to a different character.

In this traditional setup, one player takes on the role of the Game Master, Dungeon Master, Judge, Referee, or Keeper, depending on the game. The Game Master ensures the story's progression, responds to player actions, portrays supporting or antagonist characters, and resolves rules disputes. Mastering the role of Game Master can be challenging yet rewarding for players who seek to be at the heart of every game session.

Alternatively, some RPGs offer a more collaborative structure, where everyone has an equal say in shaping the narrative. The game's rules dictate who controls the story at any given time. These games often aim to emulate various forms of media, such as film or television, or specific genres of fiction.

Dungeons & Dragons, released in 1974, is widely recognized as the earliest and most influential tabletop role-playing game. While other RPGs may have preceded it, Dungeons & Dragons captured the attention of a wide audience and sparked the creation of countless other games, including video games. RPGs on home computers and game consoles emerged in the 1980s and have since grown increasingly complex and immersive.

Even today, Dungeons & Dragons remains the most popular tabletop RPG. Its influence has expanded to the computer realm with the highly anticipated release of Baldur's Gate 3. However, there's a wide array of RPGs to explore, each offering unique strengths that cater to specific fan bases.

Types Of RPGs

Categorizing RPGs is no easy task, as many games blur the lines by incorporating different features and focusing on diverse aspects. Nevertheless, here are some of the most common styles of RPGs, along with a few examples:

MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game)

MMORPGs are played by thousands, or even millions, of people online. Players connect to a central server, create and develop their characters, and embark on quests. Some servers prioritize efficient character performance and completing missions, while others emphasize role-playing, encouraging players to stay in character at all times.

World of Warcraft stands as the most renowned MMORPG, capturing the imagination of countless players worldwide. Other well-known examples include Guild Wars 2, EVE Online, Star Wars: The Old Republic, and Black Desert Online.

ARPG (Action Role-Playing Game)

Action role-playing games place a strong emphasis on combat as a major component of the gameplay. Players must master combat mechanics and equip their characters adequately. While these games often focus on single-player battles, some also incorporate multiplayer elements.

The Diablo series is a prime example of an ARPG. Other notable titles in this category include Elder Ring, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Borderlands.

CRPG (Computer or Console Role-Playing Game)

CRPGs encompass a wide range of RPGs played on computers or video game consoles. They typically offer single-player experiences with pre-scripted storylines, allowing players some freedom for exploration within dungeons or enclosed areas.

When people think of CRPGs, Bioware games like Mass Effect and Dragon Age often come to mind. Other notable CRPGs include Planescape: Torment, Disco Elysium, and Shadowrun Returns.

JRPG (Japanese Role-Playing Game)

JRPGs originated on game consoles, blending fantasy and science fiction genres. These games often revolve around party management and emphasize dramatic relationships within the context of a ""save the world"" storyline.

Conclusion

Role-playing games have evolved over the years, catering to a diverse range of players and preferences. Whether you're drawn to the massive online worlds of MMORPGs, the intense combat of ARPGs, the immersive narratives of CRPGs, or the captivating storytelling of JRPGs, there's an RPG out there to suit your taste.

As you embark on your RPG journey, remember that the heart of these games lies in the ability to assume different roles, shape narratives, and experience adventures like no other. So gather your friends, roll the dice, and prepare to be immersed in the fantastical worlds of role-playing games.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fb562b1ede4feb9fc02f0c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1795,1010,x0,y92,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 12:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
