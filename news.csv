https://www.reuters.com/technology/nigeria-files-tax-evasion-charges-against-binance-tax-agency-says-2024-03-25/,"Nigeria files tax evasion charges against Binance, tax agency says","Nigeria's revenue service has recently filed tax evasion charges against Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. The charges, filed by the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) in Abuja, include four counts of tax evasion, namely non-payment of value-added tax (VAT), company income tax, failure to file tax returns, and complicity in helping customers evade taxes through its platform.

Binance, however, has not yet commented on the tax charges. In a statement released on Monday, the company acknowledged that Nadeem Anjarwalla, Binance's regional manager for Africa, was no longer in Nigerian custody and stated that they were working with authorities to resolve the issue.

To provide some context, Tigran Gambaryan, Binance's head of financial crime compliance, and Nadeem Anjarwalla had flown to Nigeria following the country's decision to ban several cryptocurrency trading websites. They were detained upon arrival on February 26. Nigerian authorities had requested an extension of their detention after the initial warrant used to hold them lapsed.

In response to the crackdown on crypto exchanges in Nigeria, Binance announced earlier this month that it would cease all transactions and trading in the country's local currency after March 8. This move comes as part of a broader effort by the Nigerian government to address the black market for foreign exchange, which they believe is being fueled by crypto exchanges.

As a result, Binance will no longer support withdrawals, and any remaining balances in Nigerian naira will be automatically converted into Tether, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar.

It is important to note that this situation is still developing, and further updates are expected as authorities and Binance work towards resolving the issue.

In conclusion, Nigeria's revenue service has filed tax evasion charges against Binance, accusing the cryptocurrency exchange of non-payment of VAT, company income tax, failure to file tax returns, and facilitating tax evasion through its platform. Binance has stated that it is cooperating with authorities to address the issue. As the situation unfolds, it remains to be seen how this will impact Binance's operations in Nigeria and the wider cryptocurrency landscape.",https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RT7YEBQ2Y5OTFAPMEIUUQSOKIE.jpg?auth=c8a9eae1f27ef89cfb43c7e01a2f6bb2d18d771a8974652eb667098d38b91869&width=1920&height=1005&smart=true,2024-03-25 09:00:32,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/billkoenig/2024/03/25/uaw-chiefs-second-act-shawn-fain-stays-in-the-public-eye/,UAW Chiefâ€™s Second Act: Shawn Fain Stays In The Public Eye,"In 2023, Shawn Fain, the president of the United Auto Workers (UAW) union, made headlines for leading a successful strike against General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co., and Stellantis. The Detroit-based union achieved significant gains as a result of the strike. However, Fain isn't resting on his laurels and has big plans for the future.

Recently, the UAW secured commitments from President Joseph Biden to support their efforts to unionize Volkswagen AG's factory complex in Tennessee. This move follows previous unsuccessful attempts by the UAW to unionize the Tennessee VW complex. While the outcome remains uncertain, Fain remains determined to fight for the rights of autoworkers.

But Fain's ambitions don't stop there. On March 19, he co-authored an opinion piece in The Washington Post with Sen. Bernie Sanders, advocating for a four-day work week without a reduction in pay. The duo highlighted the significant increase in worker productivity over the years and the disparity between longer working hours and lower wages for many Americans. They also noted that Americans work more hours than people in most other wealthy nations.

Traditionally, UAW leaders have been vocal about various issues beyond the auto industry, including civil rights. However, in recent decades, the union has been more reserved when it comes to social issues, focusing primarily on financial difficulties and scandals. Fain, on the other hand, is demonstrating a broader scope and ambition for the UAW.

It remains to be seen where Fain's ambitions will lead him and the UAW. However, his efforts to secure unionizing rights at the Volkswagen AG factory complex in Tennessee and advocate for a shorter work week without pay reduction show his commitment to improving the lives of American workers. As the president of the UAW, Fain is determined to fight for the rights and well-being of autoworkers and push for meaningful change in the industry.

In conclusion, Shawn Fain, the president of the UAW, has made significant strides in his role. From leading successful strikes to advocating for a shorter work week, Fain is committed to improving the lives of autoworkers. His efforts to unionize the Volkswagen AG factory complex in Tennessee and address the issue of long working hours demonstrate his ambition and dedication. While the future remains uncertain, Fain's actions highlight his determination to fight for the rights and well-being of American workers.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600bf00c2acfb8ee845a3b1/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 07:30:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/intel-amd-fall-report-china-blocks-us-chips-state-computers-2024-03-25/,"Intel, AMD fall on report China blocks U.S. chips in state computers","Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) experienced a more than 2% drop in their stocks on Monday following a report that China plans to restrict the use of their chips and servers in government computers. This move could potentially pose a significant threat to the sales of these U.S. companies, amounting to billions of dollars.

Beijing has been actively working to reduce its dependence on foreign firms by developing its local semiconductor industry. This effort comes as China faces U.S. export restrictions on technology, including cutting-edge chips.

The impact of China's decision to limit the use of Intel and AMD chips could be substantial. In 2023, China accounted for 27% of Intel's revenue, making it their largest market. Similarly, AMD generated about 15% of its sales from China. On the other hand, Microsoft, whose shares experienced a slight decline in premarket trading, does not disclose its revenue from China.

According to Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, a complete cessation of China's government purchases of Intel and AMD CPUs could result in a low-single-digit revenue impact. He further predicted that Intel could suffer a hit of up to $1.5 billion, while AMD could face losses in the range of a few hundred million dollars. However, Rasgon noted that Intel may experience a larger blow to its profits due to its higher exposure and less favorable cost structure.

Despite requests for comment, Intel, AMD, and Microsoft have yet to respond to Reuters' inquiries. As a result of these developments, the combined market value of the chip firms is expected to decrease by $11 billion based on premarket movements.

In late December, China's industry ministry released a statement listing central processing units, operating systems, and centralized databases from Chinese firms that were deemed ""safe and reliable"" for three years. This move further emphasizes China's commitment to bolstering its domestic semiconductor industry.

It is worth mentioning that Apple has also found itself entangled in the escalating tensions between the United States and China. Bloomberg News reported in December that Chinese agencies and state-backed firms instructed their employees not to bring iPhones to work.

Overall, the restrictions imposed by China on the use of Intel and AMD chips in government computers could have significant consequences for these U.S. companies. As China aims to reduce its reliance on foreign firms and expand its local semiconductor industry, the impact on the earnings of Intel and AMD, as well as their market value, is expected to be substantial.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/03/25/ai-advancement-a-double-edged-sword-for-cisos/,AI Advancement: A Double-Edged Sword For CISOs,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the world of cybersecurity, presenting both opportunities and threats. As this field continues to evolve, it is crucial to identify and address the potential risks and benefits associated with AI. In this article, we will explore five major threats posed by AI to cybersecurity and discuss five ways Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) can leverage AI to their advantage.

AI has become a powerful tool for cybercriminals, enabling them to launch highly personalized phishing attacks. By analyzing stolen data, AI can create messages that closely resemble trusted sources, making it easier to deceive individuals into sharing sensitive information. However, AI also equips CISOs with the necessary tools to protect their organizations more effectively.

Let's delve into the top five AI cybersecurity threats that every CISO should prepare for:

1. AI-Phishing: AI can generate phishing emails that are virtually indistinguishable from legitimate ones, potentially granting unauthorized access to sensitive data.

2. Increased Sophistication of APTs: AI empowers cybercriminals to enhance their toolkit, making it increasingly challenging to detect phishing attacks, malware, and advanced persistent threats (APTs). Traditional security defenses may struggle to keep up with these evolving tactics.

3. Automated Vulnerability Hunting: AI algorithms can quickly scan systems for vulnerabilities, sometimes faster than we can patch them. This emphasizes the need for a race against time to fix vulnerabilities before they are exploited.

4. Evasion of Detection Systems: AI-based malware and cyberattacks are difficult to detect as they bypass standard security checks, including signature-based and anomaly detection systems.

5. Disinformation and Deepfakes: AI can generate convincing fake videos, audio, and texts that can be used to spread misinformation, damage brand reputation, or facilitate phishing attacks.

While AI presents significant threats, it also offers substantial opportunities for CISOs to enhance cybersecurity practices. AI excels at identifying hidden vulnerabilities and threats that may go unnoticed by human analysts. Here are the top five AI-driven cybersecurity opportunities for CISOs:

1. Threat Detection: AI's ability to rapidly analyze vast amounts of data enables it to identify security risks by detecting rare patterns. This proactive approach allows companies to mitigate harm before it occurs.

2. Forecasting Risks: AI can predict future attacks, enabling organizations to prepare for and mitigate threats that have yet to materialize. This can be achieved through the use of User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) and machine learning-based detection systems.

3. Streamlined Security Tasks: By automating basic functions such as network monitoring and filtering out false alarms, AI frees up CISOs to focus on more complex security issues. This automation significantly improves incident reporting, reducing the time required from days to hours.

4. Spotting Phishing Attempts: AI enhances defenses against phishing attacks by examining emails and websites for signs of fraud, making it more challenging for these attacks to succeed.

5. Smart Access Control: AI leverages behavioral analysis to detect abnormal user behavior, such as accessing data at unusual times or locations, which may indicate a security breach. This helps improve overall security measures.

CISOs should seriously consider incorporating AI into their cybersecurity strategies to prepare for the future. While AI does introduce new challenges, it also provides robust defense mechanisms that can identify and predict threats. By automating routine security tasks and enhancing protection against phishing attempts, AI empowers CISOs to tackle more complex issues and safeguard their organizations.

To make the most of AI in cybersecurity, CISOs must adopt the right AI solutions and remain vigilant. By transforming obstacles into opportunities, CISOs can create a safer digital future. The clock is ticking, and it's time to embrace AI to stay one step ahead in the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65c665858486a2b4671d9af8/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 07:45:00,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.reuters.com/technology/spanish-court-suspends-order-blocking-telegram-pending-police-report-2024-03-25/,Spanish court suspends order blocking Telegram pending police report,"Spain's High Court has suspended its own order to block messaging app Telegram's services in the country. The court is awaiting a police report on the potential impact of the temporary ban on users. The initial order was made in response to claims by media companies that Telegram was allowing users to upload content without permission. However, the court has now decided to halt the enforcement of the order and instead commission a report on Telegram's characteristics and the potential impact of the suspension. The court also requested information on the identities of users suspected of illegally sharing protected content, but the authorities in the Virgin Islands, where Telegram is registered, failed to comply with the request.

The suspension has been welcomed by the Spanish consumer association FACUA, which hopes that the police report will lead to the order being revoked. Telegram is the fourth most-used messaging service in Spain, with nearly 19% of Spaniards surveyed using the app, according to the competition watchdog CNMC.

With features such as end-to-end encryption and disappearing messages, these apps offer users a level of privacy and security that traditional forms of communication do not. However, this has also raised concerns among authorities, who worry about the potential for illegal activities to take place on these platforms.

In the case of Telegram, the app has faced criticism for its alleged role in facilitating the unauthorized sharing of copyrighted content. Media companies have accused the app of allowing users to upload content without permission, which they claim is a violation of intellectual property rights. As a result, the Spanish High Court ordered the suspension of Telegram's services in the country pending an investigation into these claims.

However, the court's decision to suspend the order suggests that it is taking a more cautious approach. Rather than immediately blocking the app, the court has opted to gather more information on the potential impact of the ban. By commissioning a police report, the court hopes to gain a better understanding of Telegram's characteristics and how the suspension would affect its users. This indicates that the court is taking into account the broader implications of its decision and is keen to ensure that any action taken is proportionate and justified.

The fact that the court's request for information on users suspected of sharing protected content was not fulfilled by the authorities in the Virgin Islands is also significant. It suggests that there may be jurisdictional challenges when it comes to enforcing intellectual property rights in the digital age. With many online platforms operating across multiple jurisdictions, it can be difficult for authorities to effectively regulate and police these platforms. This highlights the need for international cooperation and coordination in tackling online piracy and copyright infringement.

For Telegram users in Spain, the suspension of the order is undoubtedly a relief. The app is a popular choice for many Spaniards, with nearly 19% of the population surveyed using it. Its features, such as group chats and secure messaging, have made it an attractive option for those looking for an alternative to traditional messaging apps. The suspension of the order means that users can continue to enjoy these features without interruption.

However, it remains to be seen what the outcome of the police report will be and whether the court will ultimately revoke the order. The report will likely play a crucial role in informing the court's decision and providing a more complete picture of the situation. In the meantime, Telegram users in Spain can continue to use the app with the knowledge that their access to the service is secure, at least for now.

In conclusion, the Spanish High Court's decision to suspend its order to block Telegram's services in the country highlights the complexities and challenges of regulating online platforms. The court's cautious approach, coupled with its request for a police report, demonstrates a willingness to carefully consider the implications of its actions. While the suspension of the order is undoubtedly good news for Telegram users in Spain, the ultimate outcome of the case remains uncertain.
