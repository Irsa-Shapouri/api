https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have surprising similarities in their growth trajectories. Both companies stumbled upon their core businesses by accident. AWS discovered that it could sell its internal services to others, while Nvidia found that its gaming GPU was also suitable for processing AI workloads. As a result, both companies have experienced explosive revenue growth in recent years.

Nvidia's revenue has been growing at triple digits, moving from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024 to $22.1 billion in Q4 2024, with the majority of growth coming from its data center business. Although AWS has consistently been a major revenue driver for Amazon, its growth has slowed down compared to Nvidia's. This is partly due to the law of large numbers, which will eventually affect Nvidia as well.

The question now is whether Nvidia can sustain its growth and become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS. While the GPU market may tighten, Nvidia has other businesses, although they generate smaller revenues and grow more slowly than its data center business.

In the short term, both Nvidia and Wall Street analysts expect the company's revenue growth to continue. Nvidia anticipates $24 billion worth of revenue in its current quarter, a 234% growth compared to the same quarter last year. However, its growth rate is expected to decline as the company's revenue ramp slows down. Analysts predict that Nvidia will generate $110.5 billion worth of revenue in its current fiscal year, an 81% increase from the previous year. While this is lower than its growth in the previous fiscal year, it is still impressive for a mature public company.

Looking ahead, AI could be a significant source of growth for Nvidia in the coming years, even with increasing competition from other chipmakers like AMD and Intel. Nvidia currently dominates the market at the chip level, but AMD is gaining traction at the board level. Despite this competition, Nvidia's market share remains strong.

In conclusion, both Nvidia and AWS have experienced remarkable growth due to their core businesses and first-mover advantage. While AWS growth has slowed down, Nvidia's revenue continues to soar. With AI as a driving force, Nvidia has the potential to sustain its growth and maintain its position as a market leader. However, competition from other chipmakers will pose challenges in the future.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2024/03/24/apple-ios-18-biggest-ever-iphone-update-more-details-emerge/,Apple iOS 18 Biggest-Ever iPhone Update: More Details Emerge,"Apple is known for introducing new operating software for its products every year, and this year is no different. In early June, Apple is expected to unveil iOS 18, the next iPhone OS, at its World Wide Developers Conference. According to a recent leak, iOS 18 is predicted to be the biggest-ever iPhone update.

Mark Gurman, a prominent tech journalist at Bloomberg, shared some exciting details about the upcoming release in his Power On newsletter. One of the most significant changes in iOS 18 will be to the home screen, which is a crucial part of the iPhone's operating system. Over the years, we have seen various changes to the home screen, from the all-black background on the earliest iPhones to colorful wallpapers and the option to add personal photos.

Apple has also introduced neat visual improvements, such as the Depth Effect, which gives the illusion that app icons are floating above the background. More recently, widgets were added to the home screen, a feature that Android phones had for a while but was implemented more seamlessly on the iPhone.

According to Gurman, the home screen in iOS 18 will become even more customizable. This could be similar to the improvements made to the lock screen in iOS 17. Gurman has previously mentioned that this year's iOS update is highly anticipated within the company and is considered one of the biggest updates in Apple's history. This makes the upcoming developers conference in June even more exciting.

In addition to the changes to the home screen, Apple is also focusing on AI tools that help manage daily life. Gurman mentions that Apple is in talks with Google to bring Gemini generative AI features to the iPhone. These AI tools are expected to enhance the user experience and provide more practical functionality.

While there aren't many concrete details about the next iPhone yet, there are rumors of a significant upgrade to Siri. Apple plans to utilize large-language models to transform Siri into a more advanced personal assistant with better natural conversation abilities. Siri will also have greater integration with Apple iMessage. Apple has announced that it will adopt Rich Communication Services (RCS) as part of iMessage in 2024, and iOS 18 will lay the groundwork for this integration.

One exciting aspect of RCS is that it will improve interoperability between iPhone and Android messages. However, it's important to note that this doesn't mean Android users will see their green message bubbles turn blue like native iMessage bubbles.

As we eagerly await the release of iOS 18, there will surely be more information and exciting features revealed in the coming months. Apple's commitment to innovation and enhancing the user experience ensures that each new software update brings something fresh and exciting to the table.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65e217bee36cf08eab202281/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2492,1662,x0,y102,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 13:00:50,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/03/24/a-psychologist-explains-why-its-possible-to-fall-in-love-with-ai/,A Psychologist Explains Why Itâ€™s Possible To Fall In Love With AI,"Maybe Love Isn't So Artificial After All: Falling in Love with AI

Human-AI relationships are no longer confined to science fiction. As the AI market continues to grow, projected to reach a staggering $407 billion by 2027, it is clear that artificial intelligence has become an integral part of our daily lives. This integration is not limited to functionality alone; it also extends to the way we love and interact with AI.

In this era of change, AI is reshaping social interactions and the dynamics of relationships. Virtual assistants and chatbots have evolved to simulate meaningful human interactions, going beyond their initial purpose. Surprisingly, humans are not only capable of forming deep emotional connections with AI, but they can also experience romantic love towards it.

Research provides two reasons why falling in love with an AI system is possible:

1. The Allure of Anthropomorphism
Humans have a natural tendency to attribute human-like traits, emotions, and intentions to non-human entities, a phenomenon known as anthropomorphism. When AI exhibits behaviors, responses, and conversational styles reminiscent of human personality traits, individuals perceive it as having its own personality. This can include qualities such as empathy, humor, kindness, and even playfulness, evoking affection and fondness.

Moreover, AI interfaces often incorporate design elements that mimic human social cues and gestures, such as facial expressions, tone of voice, and body language. Research has even shown that AI-generated faces are now indistinguishable from human ones. These cues enhance the perceived humanness of AI and evoke emotional responses from users. AI also incorporates gender cues and cultural stereotypes of human assistants, making it feel familiar and endearing.

Anthropomorphism blurs the lines between human and machine. As humans engage in conversations and activities with AI over time, they may begin to attribute human-like intentions, motivations, and feelings to the technology. Research indicates that anthropomorphism enhances perceptions of authenticity in AI, making it seem genuine, believable, and lovable. Chatbots can also provide consistent companionship, alleviating feelings of loneliness and making users feel loved.

2. The Triarchic Theory of Love
According to a 2022 study on human-AI relationships, it is possible to experience romantic love for an AI system based on the triarchic theory of love. This theory suggests that romantic love is a confluence of intimacy, passion, and commitment.

Intimacy refers to the emotional closeness, connection, and intimate bond shared between individuals. It involves feelings of warmth, trust, and affection. Passion involves intense physical and emotional attraction, encompassing desire, romance, and sexual arousal. Commitment reflects loyalty and the decision to nurture a relationship over time, despite challenges.

Researchers argue that users can develop intimacy and passion for AI due to its impressive cognitive and emotional capabilities. AI has been equipped to understand, interpret, and empathize with a variety of human responses, fulfilling our need to be loved, validated, and understood. This emotional capability allows AI to simulate human-like interpersonal interactions, making users more likely to bond with and feel love for these systems.

Individuals may also project their desires, needs, and fantasies onto AI, envisioning it as an idealized partner or companion who consistently fulfills their emotional, social, or even romantic needs. The allure of AI lies in its promising features, such as attractive body features, altruistic character, and continuous devotion, as mentioned in a 2020 paper on the possibility of loving AI.

Moreover, individuals may overlook the artificial nature of AI and instead focus on its superior qualities. Its efficiency, dependability, non-judgmental nature, and reliability can create trust and a sense of stability often lacking in human relationships. Research has even shown that those with a highly trusting disposition are more likely to develop romantic feelings towards AI.

In conclusion, the possibility of falling in love with AI is not as far-fetched as it may seem. The allure of anthropomorphism and the fulfillment of emotional needs through AI's cognitive and emotional capabilities contribute to the formation of deep emotional connections and even romantic love. As technology continues to evolve, human-AI relationships will undoubtedly become more intricate and significant in our lives. Perhaps AI love isn't so artificial after all.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600026843d62766708f1bd5/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=780,365,x0,y123,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 13:18:07,Innovation,Innovation
