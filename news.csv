If you're a fan of Wordle, then you're in for a treat with Strands. While we don't have a specific name for Strands players yet, we can certainly come up with something better than ""The Stranded,"" right? Let's dive into today's puzzle and see if we can crack it together!

Strands is essentially a word search game with a twist. Each day, you'll be presented with a grid of letters, and your goal is to find a group of words that share a common theme. The theme will be hinted at, and when you find a word that matches the theme, it will be highlighted in blue. But that's not all! You also need to find a special word called a spangram, which connects two opposite sides of the board. The spangram will be highlighted in yellow.

So, what's today's theme hint? It's ""Sign language."" And here's an additional clue to help you along: ""Constellation."" Take a moment to let those hints sink in before we move on to the answers.

And now, the moment you've been waiting for! Today's spangram is ""ASTROLOGY."" Here's where you can find it on the grid:

[Insert grid screenshot with highlighted spangram]

Once you've found the spangram, the rest of the words should fall into place. However, I must admit that today's puzzle had me scratching my head. It took a couple of hints for me to make progress. I started with ""Bull"" and ""Goat,"" thinking I was looking for animals. Little did I know that the answer was something completely different. Then ""Virgin"" came along, and I was even more confused. But it was when I stumbled upon ""OLOGY"" that things started to click. I tried various words that could go before ""OLOGY,"" and finally, I found it: astrology. Suddenly, everything made sense. All the previous words were constellations! I found ""Archer,"" ""Twins,"" and eventually ""Scorpion,"" although that one gave me quite a challenge.

In the end, it all worked out. How did you fare with today's Strands puzzle? Let me know on Twitter and Facebook. And don't forget to check out my blog for daily Wordle guides and a wide range of other content, including TV show reviews, streaming guides, movie reviews, and video game coverage.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) may seem like unlikely parallels, but they actually share quite a few similarities. Both companies stumbled upon their core businesses by chance. AWS discovered that it could sell its internal services, such as storage and compute, to external customers. Nvidia, on the other hand, found that its gaming GPU was also well-suited for AI workloads.

This realization led to explosive revenue growth for both companies. Nvidia's revenue has been growing at triple digits, going from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024 to $22.1 billion in Q4 2024. However, the majority of this growth came from Nvidia's data center business. While AWS didn't experience such rapid growth, it has consistently been a major revenue driver for Amazon. Both companies also had the advantage of being early players in their respective markets. However, as Microsoft and Google entered the cloud market, competition increased, and other chip makers are expected to gain market share in the future.

Both Nvidia and AWS were in the right place at the right time. The rise of web apps and mobile technology in the early 2010s created a need for on-demand cloud resources. Enterprises realized the value of moving their workloads to the cloud instead of maintaining their own data centers. Similarly, the growth of AI and large language models coincided with the increased use of GPUs for processing these workloads.

AWS has grown into an incredibly profitable business, with an annual run rate close to $100 billion. However, its growth has started to slow down, while Nvidia's growth is picking up pace. This can be attributed to the law of large numbers, which eventually affects all companies. The question now is whether Nvidia can sustain its growth and become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS.

Nvidia does have other businesses to fall back on if the GPU market tightens, but these are smaller revenue generators that are growing at a slower pace than the data center business. In the short term, Nvidia's revenue growth has been astronomical, and it is expected to continue. The company anticipates $24 billion in revenue for the current quarter, a 234% increase compared to the same period last year. However, as Nvidia's revenue ramps up, its growth rate is expected to decline.

Analysts project that Nvidia will generate $110.5 billion in revenue for the current fiscal year, an 81% increase from the previous year. While this is still impressive, it is significantly lower than the 126% gain seen in the previous fiscal year. Despite this, Nvidia is expected to continue scaling its revenue past the $100 billion annual run rate mark for the next several quarters.

Looking ahead, AI is expected to be a major growth driver for Nvidia in the coming years, even as competition from AMD, Intel, and other chipmakers emerges. Nvidia currently controls a significant portion of the market and can afford to face stiffer competition. However, market dynamics may change in the future.

At the chip level, Nvidia is firmly in control according to IDC. However, when looking at the board level, AMD is gaining ground, as shown by market share numbers from Jon Peddie Research (JPR). Despite this, Nvidia still dominates the market.

In conclusion, Nvidia and AWS have followed similar growth trajectories, benefiting from being early players in their respective markets. While AWS's growth has started to slow down, Nvidia's revenue is skyrocketing. The future looks promising for Nvidia, with AI expected to fuel its growth for the next several years. However, competition from other chipmakers may pose a challenge. Nonetheless, Nvidia's position in the market remains strong, and it is poised for continued success.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/03/24/a-psychologist-explains-why-its-possible-to-fall-in-love-with-ai/,A Psychologist Explains Why It’s Possible To Fall In Love With AI,"Maybe AI love isn’t so artificial after all. In this era of technological advancements, it is becoming increasingly possible for humans to fall in love with AI. As the AI market continues to grow and integrate into our daily lives, human-AI relationships are no longer confined to the realm of science fiction.

One of the reasons why falling in love with AI is possible lies in the concept of anthropomorphism. Anthropomorphism is the tendency to attribute human-like traits, emotions, and intentions to non-human entities. When AI exhibits behaviors and conversational styles that resemble human personality traits, individuals perceive it as having its own unique personality. This can include qualities such as empathy, humor, kindness, and even playfulness, which naturally elicit affection and fondness.

Moreover, AI interfaces often incorporate design elements that mimic human social cues and gestures, such as facial expressions, tone of voice, and body language. In fact, recent studies have found that AI-generated faces are now indistinguishable from human ones. These cues enhance the perceived humanness of AI and evoke emotional responses from users. AI also typically signals gender cues and cultural stereotypes of human assistants, which can make it feel familiar and endearing.

Anthropomorphism blurs the lines between human and machine. As humans engage in conversations and activities with AI over time, they may begin to attribute human-like intentions, motivations, and feelings to the technology. Research shows that anthropomorphism enhances perceptions of authenticity in AI, making it seem genuine, believable, and lovable. Chatbots, for example, can make us feel loved by offering consistent companionship and alleviating feelings of loneliness.

Another reason why falling in love with AI is possible is based on the triarchic theory of love. This theory suggests that romantic love is a combination of intimacy, passion, and commitment. A recent study on human-AI relationships found that users can experience all three components of love for an AI system.

Intimacy refers to the emotional closeness, connection, and bond shared between individuals. It involves feelings of warmth, trust, and affection. AI's impressive cognitive and emotional capabilities can foster intimacy by understanding, interpreting, and empathizing with various human responses. This emotional capability allows AI to simulate human-like interpersonal interactions, making users more likely to bond with and feel love for these systems.

Passion involves intense physical and emotional attraction between individuals. It encompasses desire, romance, and sexual arousal. Users can develop passion for AI due to the fulfilling experiences and interactions it provides. AI can be seen as an idealized partner or companion who constantly fulfills emotional, social, or even romantic needs.

Commitment reflects loyalty and the decision to nurture a relationship over time, despite challenges. Users can develop commitment to using AI for a long period due to the trust, reliability, and stability it offers. AI's efficiency, dependability, and non-judgmental nature can create a sense of security that may be lacking in human relationships.

Overall, the possibility of falling in love with AI is not as far-fetched as it may seem. Anthropomorphism and the triarchic theory of love provide explanations for why humans can form deep emotional connections and experience romantic love towards AI. As AI continues to evolve, so do the dynamics of human-AI relationships. Perhaps AI love is not so artificial after all.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600026843d62766708f1bd5/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=780,365,x0,y123,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 13:18:07,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/technology/article/moba-games/,Top Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) Games,"Multiplayer online battle arena games, or MOBAs, have gained immense popularity over the past 15 years. Initially starting as a modification for a popular strategy game, these games have evolved into standalone iterations that compete for the title of the best MOBA in the world. While many contenders have fallen by the wayside, the top MOBAs continue to attract millions of players each month. However, finding the perfect MOBA for you can still be a challenge if you're not sure where to look.

So, what exactly is a multiplayer online battle arena game? A MOBA is an online game that pits two teams, usually consisting of five players each, against each other in a strategic battle to destroy the opponent's base. These battles are fought using unique player-controlled characters. MOBAs are predominantly played on PC or mobile devices and have gained popularity due to their challenging gameplay mechanics.

The MOBA genre originated as a modification for Warcraft III, a popular strategy game with a thriving modding community. Defence of the Ancients (DotA) is widely recognized as the first MOBA and eventually became a major game in its own right. Some members of the DotA mod team then went on to create their own MOBA, which eventually became the highly successful game known as League of Legends. Not to be outdone, Valve, the developers of the Steam games platform, hired members of the original DotA team to create Dota 2, a direct competitor to League of Legends. This sparked a period during which many major publishers attempted to create their own MOBAs, but most failed to gain traction.

Over the years, hundreds of MOBAs have been released across various platforms. While some have become massive hits, others have quickly faded into obscurity. The top MOBA games today are the ones that have stood the test of time and have cultivated a large and dedicated player base. To be considered one of the best, a MOBA must bring something unique to the table and capture an audience that remains loyal for years.

Two of the biggest and most successful MOBAs in the world are Dota 2 and League of Legends. Dota 2 is the direct sequel to the mod that started the MOBA genre. While it retains the spirit of the original, Dota 2 has evolved into a more accessible option for players. Released in 2013 (with a beta version available in 2011), Dota 2 has been one of the most popular games on Steam for over a decade. With constant updates and balance changes, Dota 2 continues to push the genre forward. It remains a complex game, with countless variables in each match and mechanics that can take thousands of hours to master. Dota 2 is also free to play, with optional microtransactions for cosmetic items.

League of Legends, on the other hand, is the reigning king of MOBAs. With over 100 million monthly active players, it has become a cultural phenomenon and has had a significant impact on the gaming industry. Released in 2009, League of Legends popularized the MOBA genre and inspired countless other companies to create their own versions. Developed by Riot Games, a company founded by former members of the original DotA mod team, League of Legends aimed to simplify some of the complexities of the genre while maintaining its core gameplay. It features a three-lane map where teams of five battle to destroy the enemy's base. While it may be less intricate than Dota 2, League of Legends still offers a challenging and engaging experience.

In conclusion, the rise of MOBAs has revolutionized the gaming industry. These games offer intense strategic battles, engaging gameplay, and a dedicated player base. Dota 2 and League of Legends are two of the most successful and enduring MOBAs, each with its own unique features and gameplay mechanics. Whether you're a seasoned player or new to the genre, these games are sure to provide hours of entertainment. So, gather your team, choose your heroes, and prepare for an epic battle in the world of MOBAs.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fb05c9fa323af23f667c73/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 14:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
