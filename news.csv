SigmaOS, a company backed by Y Combinator, is capitalizing on this trend by introducing new features such as link preview summaries, pinch-to-summarize, and ""look it up"" browsing capabilities. While some of these features resemble those offered by rival browser Arc, SigmaOS claims to provide better-quality results.

Pinch-to-summarize, one of SigmaOS' new desktop features, functions similarly to Arc's mobile feature. While the feature is able to capture sections of information, ratings, reviews, prices, and photos from an Airbnb listing, it only provides a small paragraph of information for articles, which is not sufficient. Arc's summarize function, on the other hand, consistently works across different formats, although it may occasionally miss key information.

Co-founder Mahyad Ghassemibouyaghchi explains that SigmaOS plans to adapt to different types of web pages in the future and present summaries in various formats based on the content. The standout feature of this release is called ""Look it up,"" which searches the web for a given query and generates a summary page based on the information it finds. This feature is similar to Arc's ""Browse for me"" function but is specifically designed for desktop use. One key difference is that users can ask follow-up questions to delve deeper into the topic.

In addition to these features, SigmaOS is also introducing link previews on hover and automatic renaming for locked (pinned) pages. These updates demonstrate the company's commitment to leveraging AI technology to enhance the browsing experience.

Last year, SigmaOS introduced AI-powered features, including a contextual assistant called Airis that can answer questions about web pages or the broader web. Initially, the startup attempted to monetize through team-based features but has now shifted its focus to monetizing its AI capabilities. While all users will have access to AI-powered features, there will be different pricing tiers. For $20 per month, users will have better rate limits for AI features, and for $30 per month, they will enjoy unlimited usage and the ability to choose between different models such as GPT-4, Perplexity, and Claude 3 Haiku.

Furthermore, SigmaOS has ambitious plans for the future. The company aims to release an AI agent-like feature that allows hands-free browsing. In a demo video, Ghassemibouyaghchi showcases how users can clear emails or book an Airbnb by interacting with the browser using voice commands. This concept is reminiscent of the Rabbit r1 device, which aims to navigate interfaces on behalf of users to complete tasks. Additionally, SigmaOS is exploring the development of ""repeatable flows,"" which are automatic actions triggered by factors like time. These flows can be likened to the If This Then That (IFTTT) concept but are still in the early stages of development.

SigmaOS faces competition from Arc, which recently raised $50 million in funding and plans to create an AI agent that browses the web on behalf of users. Ghassemibouyaghchi reveals that over 100,000 users are currently using SigmaOS' product. To date, the company has raised $4 million from investors such as LocalGlobe and Y Combinator. With this new release, SigmaOS aims to gain traction in the market and prepare for its next round of funding.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SigmaOS.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-26 15:30:36,Innovation,Innovation
