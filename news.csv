Severino was disqualified for biting Lima in the second round. 

Pressure and combat sports can lead to unexpected behavior, as demonstrated in the recent incident at UFC Fight Night: Ribas vs. Namajunas. In his UFC debut, Igor Severino shocked the audience by biting his fellow Brazilian opponent, Andre Lima, during the second round of their preliminary bout. This act of aggression resulted in Severino's disqualification, as confirmed by visible bite marks captured in images from the event.

Severino, a 20-year-old fighter, missed an opportunity to make a name for himself in the UFC due to his controversial actions. The disqualification marked the first loss of Severino's previously undefeated career, dropping his record to 9-1, while Lima maintained his spotless record at 8-0. UFC CEO Dana White wasted no time in severing ties with Severino, emphasizing the severity of the situation. White expressed disappointment in Severino's decision to resort to biting, a reprehensible act in the world of combat sports that carries significant consequences.

Biting incidents in combat sports are rare but deeply frowned upon, as they violate the integrity and respect expected in competitive fighting. Lima's composed reaction to being bitten showcased his professionalism, leading to a swift investigation and Severino's expulsion from the promotion. Severino now faces the challenge of rebuilding his reputation in smaller circuits before earning another opportunity in reputable mixed martial arts organizations like the UFC or the Professional Fighters League.

As the dust settles on the controversial bout in Las Vegas, fans can anticipate more conventional results from the event.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2024/03/23/the-invisible-shield-aims-to-makes-public-health-more-visible/,‘The Invisible Shield’ Aims To Makes Public Health More Visible,"Introducing ""The Invisible Shield"": Shedding Light on the Unsung Heroes of Public Health

In the world of football, offensive linemen often go unnoticed unless they make a mistake and get penalized. Similarly, public health professionals work tirelessly behind the scenes to protect us from various health threats, yet their efforts often go unnoticed. That's why a new TV series called ""The Invisible Shield"" aims to bring attention to the vital role of public health. Premiering on PBS on March 26 at 10 pm, this four-episode series promises to shed light on the importance of public health in our lives.

The title ""The Invisible Shield"" captures the essence of the show. It reflects the lack of attention given to the public health system, while emphasizing the crucial work it does every day to safeguard our well-being. While we are bombarded with news about celebrities, politics, and unnecessary products, the public health system quietly operates in the background. As Dr. Kelly Henning, the Public Health Program Lead for Bloomberg Philanthropies, states in the first episode, ""The better public health works, the less likely you are to see it."" Unfortunately, this ""invisible shield"" has been crumbling for years, and most people are unaware of it.

The Covid-19 pandemic should have been a wake-up call, exposing the chronic underfunding and underappreciation of public health systems. If our public health system had received the support and resources it desperately needed to combat SARS-CoV-2, countless lives could have been saved, and much suffering could have been avoided. However, even though politicians and business leaders briefly acknowledged the importance of public health during the pandemic, lasting support and resources were not provided. This raises the question of what it will take for everyone to realize the urgent need for a stronger public health system. Must we wait for a disaster even more significant than Covid-19 before recognizing the importance of preventive measures?

Recognizing the need for immediate action, RadicalMedia, in collaboration with Bloomberg Philanthropies, produced ""The Invisible Shield"" to raise awareness about public health. In a world dominated by self-promotion and marketing campaigns, public health often gets overshadowed. Consequently, people fail to recognize the significant impact it has had on their lives. Consider this: without public health achievements such as vaccination programs, antibiotic development, clean water supplies, and anti-pollution efforts, many of us wouldn't be here today to buy into the hype surrounding celebrities and their products. As Dr. Josh Sharfstein, Distinguished Professor of the Practice at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, poignantly states in the trailer for ""The Invisible Shield,"" ""Public health saved your life today, but you didn't even know it.""

While four episodes may not be enough to fully showcase the extensive contributions of public health throughout history, ""The Invisible Shield"" aims to provide a glimpse into its impact. In the first episode, titled ""The Old Playbook,"" the series explores how public health has doubled life expectancy since 1900. However, it also highlights the current risks and challenges faced by the public health system, which is on the verge of collapse in many ways. By examining lessons learned from previous epidemics and pandemics, the show offers valuable insights into the efforts made by public health professionals.

So, mark your calendars for March 26th and tune in to PBS to watch ""The Invisible Shield."" Join us in recognizing the unsung heroes of public health who tirelessly work to protect us. Let's appreciate their invaluable contributions and support their ongoing efforts to build a stronger and more resilient public health system. Remember, public health may be invisible, but its impact is undeniable.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff76b9cc324c33ed5484d7/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-23 21:25:08,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/23/explained-the-difference-between-a-solar-eclipse-and-a-lunar-eclipse/,Explained: The Difference Between A Solar Eclipse And A Lunar Eclipse,"Do you know the distinction between a solar eclipse and a lunar eclipse? In the upcoming weeks, two eclipses will occur—a lunar eclipse on Monday, March 25, and a solar eclipse on Monday, April 8. Despite their differences, both phenomena are caused by the same celestial alignment.

A lunar eclipse occurs when Earth's shadow is cast onto the moon, while a solar eclipse happens when the moon blocks the sun's light, creating a shadow on Earth. The occurrence of both types of eclipses is quite rare due to slight variations in the orbital planes of the Earth and the moon around the sun.

To understand what causes a lunar eclipse, it is important to note that it can only happen during a full moon when Earth is positioned between the sun and the moon, projecting a shadow into space. While full moons occur every 29 days, it is uncommon for the moon to pass through Earth's shadow. When it does, a lunar eclipse takes place.

On the other hand, a solar eclipse can only occur during a new moon when the moon is positioned between the sun and Earth, casting a shadow onto Earth. New moons happen every 29 days, approximately two weeks after a full moon. However, it is rare for the moon to block the sun from Earth's perspective. When this does happen, it is known as a solar eclipse.

Now, let's delve into what causes total lunar eclipses. A perfect alignment of the sun, Earth, and moon is necessary. Earth has two shadows—the outer penumbral shadow and the inner umbral shadow. During a lunar eclipse, when the full moon passes through Earth's umbral shadow, it receives no direct light from the sun. The only light present on the moon's surface is sunlight refracted by Earth's atmosphere. This creates a stunning display of a pinkish-red moon, resembling a thousand sunsets. If you were on the moon during a lunar eclipse, you would be surrounded by a pinkish-red glow and witness a partial or total solar eclipse.

On March 25, a penumbral lunar eclipse will occur as the full ""Worm Moon"" moves through Earth's penumbra.

To understand total solar eclipses, we must consider a perfect alignment of the sun, moon, and Earth. A new moon also has two shadows—the outer penumbral shadow and the inner umbral shadow. When a new moon completely blocks the sun, it projects its umbral shadow onto Earth. This shadow travels across Earth's surface as the moon orbits from west to east, coinciding with the rotation of the Earth. The moon's shadow movement slows down due to this alignment, resulting in a path of totality known as the umbral shadow. Within this path, observers can witness the awe-inspiring phenomenon of a total solar eclipse. If you were standing on the moon during a total solar eclipse, you would witness the moon's shadow crossing Earth.

On April 8, a total solar eclipse will occur as the new ""Pink Moon"" perfectly blocks the sun, projecting its umbral shadow over North America.

The rarity of lunar and solar eclipses can be attributed to the moon's orbit around Earth, which is tilted approximately 5 degrees with respect to the sun's path through the sky. This tilt means that the moon's path intersects with the sun twice during each orbit, approximately every month. However, for a solar or lunar eclipse to occur, the moon must be in its new or full phase. This specific alignment happens twice a year, resulting in two ""eclipse seasons"" that guarantee the occurrence of solar and lunar eclipses. Nevertheless, most solar eclipses are either partial or annular (""ring of fire""), and most lunar eclipses are penumbral or partial.

Looking ahead, here are the upcoming lunar and solar eclipses in 2024:
- March 25, 2024: Penumbral lunar eclipse (visible in North America)
- April 8, 2024: Total solar eclipse (visible in North America)
- September 17, 2024: Partial lunar eclipse (visible in North America)
- October 2, 2024: Annular solar eclipse (visible in the Pacific Ocean and South America)

And here are the eclipses in 2025:
- March 13, 2025: Total lunar eclipse (visible in North America)
- March 29, 2025: Partial solar eclipse (visible in Canada and northern Europe)
- September 7, 2025: Total lunar eclipse (visible in Asia)
- September 21, 2025: Partial solar eclipse (visible in Antarctica)

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/24/debunked-i-think-ive-seen-a-total-solar-eclipse-before/,Debunked: ‘I Think I’ve Seen A Total Solar Eclipse Before’,"Total Solar Eclipses: A Rare and Unforgettable Celestial Event

If you’ve ever thought you witnessed a total solar eclipse, think again. As eclipse chasers often say, this belief is rarely accurate. Many people confuse a partial solar eclipse, which occurs twice a year in various parts of the world, with the awe-inspiring phenomenon of totality. Experiencing totality, when the moon completely blocks the sun, is an unforgettable event that leaves a lasting impression on the fortunate few who have witnessed it.

One of the reasons we can be certain about this is because those who have truly seen a total solar eclipse never forget it. It's not a vague memory that fades over time; it's a cherished moment that stays with them forever. Additionally, witnessing a total solar eclipse requires significant effort, as you must be in the path of totality. This path is a narrow strip on Earth where the moon completely obscures the sun. If you were not within this path, what you saw was not a total solar eclipse.

In recent years, North America has been blessed with a series of total solar eclipses, creating a golden age for eclipse enthusiasts. One of the most notable events was the ""Great American Eclipse"" in 2017, which brought totality to 12 U.S. states, spanning from Oregon to South Carolina. Around 12 million people lived within the path of totality, and approximately one million travelers flocked to witness this extraordinary spectacle. If you were lucky enough to be in the path, you would remember the breathtaking twilight-like sky, the moon's silhouette, and the stunning sight of the sun's corona shining brilliantly. It's an experience that leaves an indelible mark on your memory.

If you are unsure whether you truly witnessed a total solar eclipse, there are ways to confirm it. Many people believe they saw one during their school or work years, often involving solar eclipse glasses or pinhole cameras. It's highly likely that these memories are from the 2017 partial solar eclipse, which was visible across North America. To be sure, you can consult the Solar Eclipses Visibility Database and verify the location and date of your memory.

To assist you further, here is a list of all the total solar eclipses that have occurred in North America over the past 70 years, according to GreatAmericanEclipse.com. Each link leads to an interactive map showing the path of totality on specific dates. If your memory does not align with these dates, it is likely that you witnessed a partial solar eclipse.

The disappointment of realizing that what you saw was not a total solar eclipse can be softened by informing you about an upcoming celestial event. On April 8, there will be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to witness a total eclipse of the sun, and this time it will be shared by an astonishing 42 million people, including 32 million Americans. This celestial wonder will grace a narrow 115-mile path through parts of Mexico, 15 U.S. states, and Canada. It will traverse five states in Mexico, 15 U.S. states, and six Canadian provinces. Only those within this path will have the privilege of experiencing totality.

While everyone in North America will be able to witness a partial solar eclipse on April 8, the true spectacle of totality will be reserved for those within the narrow path. This once-in-a-lifetime event presents a unique opportunity for you to finally experience totality and join the exclusive group of individuals who have witnessed this extraordinary phenomenon.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2024/03/24/epa-didnt-ban-gas-cars-it-cut-air-pollution-so-we-can-breathe-easier/,EPA Didn’t Ban Gas Cars. It Cut Air Pollution So We Can Breathe Easier.,"On red air days, when pollution levels rise to unhealthy levels, it's crucial to stay indoors and avoid outdoor activities. This is especially important for vulnerable populations such as the elderly, children, pregnant women, and those with respiratory illnesses.

The primary culprit behind toxic air in many areas is the emissions from internal combustion engines running on gas or diesel. With over two-thirds of Americans relying on personal vehicles for daily transportation, the transportation sector has become the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. In fact, light-duty vehicles alone contribute to nearly 60% of the sector's climate pollution.

To address the pervasive air pollution issue, we must focus on reducing tailpipe emissions from vehicles. Luckily, we have an effective solution at our disposal: tailpipe emissions standards. Recently, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency implemented new rules for light-duty and smaller medium-duty vehicles, setting limits on tailpipe pollution to protect public health and combat climate change. These updated standards push automakers to adopt cleaner technologies, ensuring that new vehicles are more environmentally friendly than ever before.

It's essential that everyone has the option to choose a clean car for their next vehicle. Those who prioritize reducing pollution should have the opportunity to drive electric vehicles.

While these updated pollution limits are a step in the right direction, some entities view them as a threat. Corporations profiting from selling polluting vehicles and petroleum are pushing back against these standards, claiming they infringe on American freedoms and consumer choice. However, the truth is that these regulations are long overdue and will benefit all Americans by improving air quality and providing consumers with alternatives to costly fossil fuels.

A recent disinformation campaign launched by profit-driven corporate polluters aims to mislead the public into thinking that the EPA's standards equate to a ban on gas cars. In reality, the EPA's standards are technology-neutral, performance-based, and grounded in scientific research. The Clean Air Act, enacted in 1970, mandates the EPA to establish National Ambient Air Quality Standards to safeguard public health and regulate emissions from vehicles and engines.

Before the Clean Air Act, major cities like New York and Los Angeles suffered from severe air pollution, with conditions comparable to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day. The implementation of the Act led to significant reductions in harmful emissions and spurred the development of innovative technologies like catalytic converters and the switch to unleaded fuel.

It's clear that the EPA's efforts to reduce tailpipe emissions are crucial for protecting public health and combating climate change. By prioritizing clean air and sustainable transportation options, we can create a healthier environment for all.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fe401fc35aefb76700b52e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 07:45:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/anuradhavaranasi/2024/03/24/which-adhd-medications-could-lower-risk-of-suicide--hospitalization/,These ADHD Medications Could Lower Risk Of Suicide & Hospitalization,"ADHD Medications Associated with Lower Risk of Suicide and Psychiatric Hospitalizations

A recent study conducted by researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, has found that individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) who were prescribed ADHD stimulant medications had a lower risk of suicide attempts and deaths by suicide. The study, which included 221,714 adults and adolescents with ADHD, also revealed that the use of ADHD medications was associated with fewer psychiatric hospitalizations.

The researchers, led by Heidi Taipale, observed that four specific ADHD medications were linked to a decreased risk of hospitalization due to psychiatric co-morbidities. These medications include amphetamine, lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate. Furthermore, the study found that using lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate was associated with a decreased risk of suicidal behavior.

ADHD is often accompanied by psychiatric co-morbidities, with a 2019 study in Sweden reporting a 52% prevalence of such conditions among individuals with ADHD compared to only 7% among those without ADHD. Psychiatric co-morbidities include major depressive disorder, panic disorder, substance abuse, generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, PTSD, and psychotic symptoms. The presence of psychiatric co-morbidities was also found to increase the risk of mortality among individuals with ADHD, especially when substance use disorder was involved.

While atomoxetine, an ADHD medication, was not associated with a lower risk of psychiatric hospitalizations or suicidal behavior, the study did find a connection between atomoxetine use and fewer hospitalizations for non-psychiatric co-morbidities.

The researchers noted that ADHD medications, particularly stimulants, have been shown to improve functioning and quality of life in addition to addressing core ADHD symptoms. However, there is still limited knowledge regarding the long-term effectiveness and safety of these medications. The study aimed to investigate the association between specific ADHD medication use and the risk of psychiatric hospitalization in a nationwide cohort of adolescents and adults with ADHD.

The study included individuals between the ages of 16 and 65 residing in Sweden who had received an ADHD diagnosis between 2006 and 2021. The researchers analyzed the participants' healthcare data from the Swedish National Patient Register, including inpatient and outpatient records. They also tracked the participants' prescribed ADHD medication purchases using data from the Prescribed Drug Register. Methylphenidate was the most commonly used ADHD medication among 68.5% of the cohort, followed by lisdexamphetamine (35.2%) and atomoxetine (15.6%).

The study followed the participants for 15 years, during which it was found that 56% of them had a psychiatric co-morbidity. Anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and stress-related disorders were the most common co-morbidities, with nearly 26% of participants being hospitalized due to a psychiatric co-morbidity.

Interestingly, the study found that lisdexamphetamine was associated with a decreased risk of psychiatric hospitalizations among adolescents, young adults, and adults aged 30 and older. However, methylphenidate appeared to be less effective among older adults. The researchers suggested that methylphenidate may be less effective in individuals aged 30 and older or that there may be some initial effect that diminishes with longer-term use, age, or the course of the illness. Atomoxetine, on the other hand, was linked to a decreased risk of hospitalization among women but not men.

Overall, the study found that ADHD medications had a beneficial effect on psychiatric outcomes, with a decreased risk of non-psychiatric hospitalizations as well. However, there are concerns about the long-term use of stimulant medications, as they can increase blood pressure and heart rate, potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. There are also concerns about an increased risk of seizures, psychosis, or mania associated with stimulant use.

The study was published online on March 20, 2024, in JAMA Network Open. These findings highlight the potential benefits of ADHD medications in reducing the risk of suicide and psychiatric hospitalizations among individuals with ADHD. Further research is needed to explore the long-term effectiveness and safety of these medications, particularly with regards to potential adverse effects.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/63c28dbb82c31b7412c92cf2/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 04:09:46,Innovation,Innovation
