Despite announcing in January that the app would be closing due to a lack of market opportunity, it has continued to function in the weeks since. Systrom has revealed that he and Krieger are keeping the app alive and have not given up on maintaining it in the future. While it is still likely to be shut down eventually, the founders are exploring all possible options for the app moving forward.

When Artifact was launched, it gained attention not only because it was the first major social app from the Instagram co-founders, but also because of its innovative use of AI. The app used AI to help users discover news articles based on their interests from a variety of trusted sources. It also offered features to summarize news articles in different styles and rewrite clickbait headlines for better clarity.

Following Artifact's announcement of its impending closure, there has been increased interest in using AI to summarize news. Arc, a browser startup, implemented an AI-powered ""pinch to summarize"" feature ahead of its $50 million fundraising round. Other startups, such as Feeeed, Bulletin, and Particle, have also utilized AI to enhance the news reading experience. These developments indicate a growing interest from investors in this space.

Artifact was self-funded by Systrom and Krieger with a significant amount of money. This suggests that they have the funds to continue running the app for the time being. However, social features like commenting and posting have been removed from the app, leaving only the news reading and AI summarization features.

While the future of Artifact remains uncertain, the fact that it is still operational provides hope for its dedicated user base. Systrom and Krieger are actively exploring options to keep the app alive and are considering potential exit deals. Despite its impending closure, Artifact's impact on the news discovery space and its innovative use of AI are likely to leave a lasting impression.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Product_Shot.jpeg?w=1200,2024-03-26 16:42:39,Innovation,Innovation
