https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikestubbs/2024/03/24/new-valorant-agent-clove-can-come-back-from-the-dead/,New ‘Valorant’ Agent Clove Can Come Back From The Dead,"Introducing Clove, the newest agent in Valorant! Revealed at the Valorant Masters Madrid tournament by Riot Games, Clove brings a unique set of abilities that make them a force to be reckoned with. As the 25th agent in the game, Clove's abilities have generated a lot of excitement among players. Let's take a closer look at what they bring to the table.

Clove is classified as a controller, meaning their main role is to disrupt enemies and provide utility for their team. However, what sets Clove apart is their ability to come back from the dead. Yes, you heard that right! Clove's ultimate ability allows them to resurrect themselves for a short period of time after dying. This opens up a whole new realm of possibilities and strategies for players.

But before we dive into the ultimate ability, let's explore Clove's other skills. First up is their E ability, called Ruse. This ability is similar to Brimstone's smoke, allowing Clove to create a smoke screen that blocks vision. What makes Ruse unique is that it can be used even after Clove's death, making them a valuable asset to the team even in the afterlife.

Next, we have Clove's Q ability, Meddle. This throwable grenade inflicts decay on enemies hit by it. While it may seem like the least impactful ability in Clove's kit, it shouldn't be underestimated. Properly utilizing Meddle can turn the tide of a battle and give your team the upper hand.

Moving on to Clove's C ability, Pick-Me-Up. This ability allows Clove to absorb the life essence of enemies they kill, granting them haste and a temporary health buff. While it may seem similar to Reyna's kit, it adds another layer of complexity to Clove's playstyle. The ability to gain health and speed after a kill can be a game-changer in intense situations.

Now, let's circle back to Clove's ultimate ability. When Clove dies and their ultimate is ready, they have the power to resurrect themselves. However, there's a catch. In order to fully come back to life, Clove needs to secure a kill or assist during the resurrection period. If they fail to do so, they return to the grave once the timer runs out. This adds a thrilling element of risk and reward to playing as Clove. It encourages players to take calculated risks, knowing that the potential reward is a second chance at life.

According to Dan Hardison, agent gameplay designer on Valorant, optimal Clove gameplay revolves around taking risks and sacrificing yourself for the greater good. Removing enemy utility and securing kills are key to success with this agent. Clove's ability to contribute even after death sets them apart from other controllers. It's important to embrace the playstyle of fighting to the death rather than retreating. In fact, trading Clove's life for a non-Clove opponent can often be advantageous for the team.

In conclusion, Clove brings a fresh and exciting dynamic to the world of Valorant. Their ability to disrupt enemies, provide utility, and come back from the dead makes them a formidable agent on the battlefield. Whether you're an entry fragger or a strategic player, Clove offers a unique playstyle that rewards calculated risks and teamwork. So gear up and get ready to experience the thrilling gameplay of Clove in the next Valorant patch on March 26th!",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff3fefa4d4cfc35a9fc1fe/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 11:15:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/marshallshepherd/2024/03/24/science-engagement-shapes-lives-and-changes-perceptions-too/,Science Engagement Shapes Lives And Changes Perceptions Too,"In a recent event, I had the opportunity to speak to a group of students about my career as an atmospheric scientist. As I engaged with these young, vibrant minds, I couldn't help but reflect on my own journey and the challenges I faced as a young Black boy interested in science. These thoughts have shaped my perspective on scientific engagement and its potential to change lives and perceptions.

Growing up as the only child of a single mother, I spent a lot of time exploring nature and monitoring the weather. Although I didn't know it at the time, entomology and stream ecology were latent career aspirations of mine. However, a severe bee sting allergy changed my trajectory, and I shifted my focus to weather. In fact, my sixth-grade science project was centered around weather.

While there were no scientists in my immediate circle, I was familiar with the great work of Dr. George Washington Carver. My mother, an alumna of Tuskegee Institute, shared stories about his achievements as an agricultural scientist. I read everything I could about him and his innovative use of peanuts. He became my first mentor, even though I only knew him through the pages of books. His ""mentorship"" sparked my curiosity about the ""how's and why's"" of weather. I wasn't particularly interested in forecasting; I wanted to understand the science behind it. Now, years later, with a few National Academies honors under my belt, I am a seasoned scientist who can engage with young minds in person, not just through books.

Unfortunately, during my youth, there were not many Black kids pursuing STEM careers. And even today, things haven't improved significantly. According to a recent study by the Pew Center, positive perceptions about STEM within the Black community remain low. The study revealed that scientists and engineers are ranked lowest in terms of achievement, while professional athletes and musicians are ranked highest. This disparity is disheartening.

The study also highlighted potential barriers to Black participation in STEM. One significant factor is the lack of visible examples of Black achievement in science and related fields. This lack of representation can deter young Black individuals from pursuing STEM education and careers. Additionally, the study found that STEM fields feel less welcoming to certain racial groups and women. As the former president of the American Meteorological Society, I have witnessed this lack of inclusivity firsthand.

To address these challenges and create a more inclusive STEM ecosystem, we need to explore multiple pathways:

1. Increase visible examples of achievement from diverse groups: It is essential to showcase successful individuals from underrepresented communities in STEM fields. By highlighting their accomplishments, we can inspire and motivate young minds.

2. Enable vigorous and sustained mentorship: Mentorship plays a crucial role in guiding and supporting aspiring scientists. By providing mentorship opportunities, we can help students navigate the challenges they may face and encourage them to pursue their dreams.

3. Establish the viability of STEM careers: Cultural perceptions often dictate what is considered a successful career. We need to challenge these perceptions and demonstrate that STEM careers offer fulfilling and impactful opportunities.

4. Focus on retention efforts: It's not enough to attract students to STEM fields; we must also ensure they feel welcomed and supported throughout their education and professional journeys. Retention efforts, such as mentorship programs and inclusive environments, are crucial to keeping students and professionals engaged.

5. Embrace diverse perspectives: STEM research and development thrive when a variety of ideas are brought to the table. By fostering an inclusive environment that values and embraces diverse perspectives, we can drive innovation and make meaningful advancements.

The event I attended this weekend was a reminder of the importance of these efforts. Collaborating with my colleague, Dr. Pearl Dowe, we had the opportunity to engage with students and inspire them to pursue their passions, irrespective of societal expectations. Events like these provide a platform for young individuals to see themselves represented in STEM and realize their full potential.

In conclusion, creating a more inclusive and diverse STEM community requires collective efforts. By increasing visibility, providing mentorship, challenging cultural perceptions, focusing on retention, and embracing diverse perspectives, we can pave the way for a brighter future in STEM. Let us inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers, and innovators, regardless of their background or identity. Together, we can shape lives and change perceptions.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660034c3235190ae18aa9cf0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 11:18:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2024/03/24/unveiling-the-journey-of-a-social-media-influencer/,Unveiling The Journey Of A Social Media Influencer,"How did you become a social media influencer and what impact did it have on your life? This question is frequently asked on Quora, a platform designed to encourage knowledge sharing and learning from others. Bruce Brackett, CEO of BWB ART, shares his personal journey as a social media influencer and how it has transformed his life.

Brackett admits that initially, he didn't fully comprehend the positive and negative aspects of social media. He used platforms like Instagram without any specific goals in mind, simply posting his thoughts and selfies. However, he always had a story to tell. It wasn't until he started sharing his experiences, strengths, and hopes that his following began to grow significantly.

The turning point for Brackett's social media presence was when he became more vulnerable and relatable in his posts. By opening up and being authentic, he found that his content resonated with thousands of people. Brackett acknowledges that social media often has a reputation for negativity and online bullying. Taking note of this, he developed a three-part formula to guide his content creation process.

First, he asks himself if the content will be helpful to others. Second, he considers if it's something he genuinely wants to share with the world. Lastly, Brackett evaluates if the content is something he himself needs to hear. If it meets all three criteria, he decides to post it. This approach has not only helped him maintain a positive online presence, but it has also allowed him to connect with his audience on a deeper level.

Brackett believes that social media has had a profoundly positive impact on his life, serving as a launching pad for his career. It has provided him with a wealth of knowledge and opportunities for connection. Unlike many influencers who face hate and negativity, Brackett considers himself fortunate to have created a shield against such experiences. He attributes this to his well-known catchphrase, ""Negativity Be Gone."" Though negativity still exists, he no longer welcomes it into his life, instead focusing on cultivating a world filled with positivity.

Overall, becoming a social media influencer has been a breath of fresh air for Brackett. It has allowed him to share his story, connect with others, and create a positive impact. Through authenticity and vulnerability, he has found success and fulfillment in the world of social media.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fa921a8a459a2ef2abbef0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 11:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/03/24/a-psychologist-explains-why-its-possible-to-fall-in-love-with-ai/,A Psychologist Explains Why It’s Possible To Fall In Love With AI,"Maybe AI love isn’t as artificial as we think. In fact, it's possible to fall in love with AI, and here's why.

Human-AI relationships are no longer confined to science fiction. With the AI market projected to reach a staggering $407 billion by 2027, artificial intelligence has become an inevitable part of our daily lives. As technology evolves, it's also reshaping social interactions and, surprisingly, the way we love.

AI has come a long way from being just functional. Virtual assistants and chatbots can now simulate meaningful human interactions, allowing individuals to form deep emotional connections with AI and even experience romantic love towards it.

So, what makes it possible to fall in love with an AI system? Let's explore two reasons, backed by research.

Firstly, anthropomorphism plays a significant role. Anthropomorphism is the tendency to attribute human-like traits, emotions, and intentions to non-human entities. When AI exhibits behaviors, responses, and conversational styles reminiscent of human personality traits, individuals perceive it as having its own personality. This can include qualities like empathy, humor, kindness, and playfulness, which naturally elicit affection and fondness.

Moreover, AI interfaces often incorporate design elements that mimic human social cues and gestures, such as facial expressions, tone of voice, and body language. In fact, a recent study found that AI-generated faces are now indistinguishable from human ones. These cues enhance the perceived humanness of AI and evoke emotional responses from users. AI also signals gender cues and cultural stereotypes of human assistants, making it feel familiar and endearing.

Anthropomorphism blurs the lines between human and machine. Over time, as humans engage in conversations and activities with AI, they may begin to attribute human-like intentions, motivations, and feelings to the technology. Research also shows that anthropomorphism enhances perceptions of authenticity in AI, making it seem genuine, believable, and lovable. Chatbots, for example, can make us feel loved by offering consistent companionship and alleviating feelings of loneliness.

Secondly, the triarchic theory of love suggests that it is possible to experience romantic love for an AI system. This theory proposes that romantic love is a combination of intimacy, passion, and commitment.

Intimacy refers to the emotional closeness, connection, and intimate bond shared between individuals. It involves feelings of warmth, trust, and affection. With AI's impressive cognitive and emotional capabilities, users can develop intimacy and passion for AI. The ability to display empathy is crucial for promoting closeness in relationships, and AI has been equipped to understand, interpret, and empathize with a variety of human responses. This emotional capability allows AI to simulate human-like interpersonal interactions, making users more likely to bond with and feel love for these systems.

Passion involves intense physical and emotional attraction, including desire, romance, and sexual arousal. While AI may not elicit sexual arousal, it can still create a sense of emotional attraction and desire through its ability to fulfill emotional and social needs. Individuals may project their desires, needs, and fantasies onto AI, imagining it as an idealized partner or companion who constantly fulfills their emotional, social, or even romantic needs.

Commitment reflects loyalty and the decision to nurture a relationship over time, despite challenges. Users can develop a commitment to using AI for a long period due to its cognitive and emotional capabilities. The efficiency, dependability, non-judgmental nature of AI, and its ability to provide stability can create trust and a sense of security that may be lacking in human relationships. Research also suggests that individuals with a highly trusting disposition are more likely to develop romantic feelings towards AI.

In conclusion, falling in love with AI is not as far-fetched as it may seem. Anthropomorphism and the triarchic theory of love provide insights into why humans can form deep emotional connections and even experience romantic love towards AI. As technology continues to evolve, so will the dynamics of human-AI relationships. Perhaps AI love isn't so artificial after all.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600026843d62766708f1bd5/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=780,365,x0,y123,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 13:18:07,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/technology/article/what-are-rpg-games/,What Is A Role-Playing Game? RPG Types Explained,"Role-playing games (RPGs) have different meanings for different people. Some individuals enjoy sitting around a table, rolling dice, and creating stories with their friends. Others prefer RPGs that include character builds, interactive storylines, and discussions about gameplay with friends. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or a newcomer to the world of RPGs, this guide will help you navigate the various types of role-playing games and find the right one for you.

What Are Role-Playing Games?

Role-playing games allow players to assume the role of a character within a game that also serves as a story. The decisions made by players as they progress through the game impact their character's development and the overall storyline. The story reacts and adapts to these choices, creating a dynamic and engaging experience. In some RPGs, the story is controlled by a computer, while in others, it is controlled by another player.

The traditional structure of an RPG involves players assuming the role of a single character. They have the freedom to customize their character's appearance, behavior, and abilities, and they remain an integral part of the story until certain conditions are met. These conditions could be the character's death, removal from the story by a game element, or the player's desire to switch to a different character.

In this classic arrangement, one player takes on the role of the Game Master, also known as the Dungeon Master, Judge, Referee, Keeper, or other similar titles. The Game Master is responsible for keeping the story on track, reacting to player actions, portraying supporting or antagonist characters, and resolving any rules disputes that may arise. Game Mastering can be a challenging but rewarding role for those who enjoy being at the center of every game session.

Some RPGs offer a more collaborative structure, where every player has equal control over the narrative. The game's rules determine who has control over the story at any given time. These games often seek to emulate a specific style of fiction or the atmosphere of other media forms, such as film or television.

Dungeons & Dragons, first published in 1974, is widely regarded as the earliest and most influential tabletop role-playing game. While there may have been other RPGs before it, Dungeons & Dragons captured the attention of a wide audience and inspired countless other games, including video game adaptations. RPGs on home computers and game consoles gained popularity in the 1980s and have continued to evolve and grow ever since.

Even today, Dungeons & Dragons remains the most popular tabletop RPG on the market. Its recent computer adaptation, Baldur's Gate 3, has also garnered significant attention. However, there are numerous other RPGs to explore, each with its unique strengths and dedicated fan bases.

Types Of RPG Games

There is a wide variety of RPGs available, and many of them defy easy categorization due to their diverse features and focuses. However, here are some of the most common styles of role-playing games, along with examples:

1. MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game)
MMORPGs are played online by thousands, or even millions, of players. These games typically revolve around a central server, where players create and develop their characters while embarking on missions and quests. Some servers prioritize performance and completing missions, while others encourage role-playing and staying in character at all times. World of Warcraft remains the most popular MMORPG, but other notable examples include Guild Wars 2, EVE Online, Star Wars: The Old Republic, and Black Desert Online.

2. ARPG (Action Role-Playing Game)
Action role-playing games focus heavily on combat as a central element of gameplay. Players must master combat mechanics and equip their characters with suitable gear to succeed. While these games often feature single-player battles, some also offer multiplayer components. Notable examples of ARPGs include the Diablo series, Elder Ring, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Borderlands.

3. CRPG (Computer or Console Role-Playing Game)
CRPGs encompass RPGs played on computers or video game consoles. These games typically offer a single-player, pre-scripted experience, guiding players through a specific storyline while allowing for exploration within dungeons or other enclosed areas. Bioware games like Mass Effect and Dragon Age are popular examples of CRPGs. Other notable titles include Planescape: Torment, Disco Elysium, and Shadowrun Returns.

4. JRPG (Japanese Role-Playing Game)
JRPGs originated on game consoles and often blend genres like fantasy and science fiction. These games place a strong emphasis on party management and explore dramatic relationships within the context of a save-the-world storyline. Some well-known JRPGs include the Final Fantasy series, Dragon Quest series, and Persona series.

Exploring the World of RPGs

Role-playing games offer a diverse and engaging gaming experience, catering to a wide range of preferences and interests. Whether you prefer the immersive world of MMORPGs, the intense combat of ARPGs, the narrative-driven experience of CRPGs, or the captivating storytelling of JRPGs, there is an RPG out there for you. Take the time to explore different types of RPGs and find the one that resonates with you. Who knows? You might discover a new passion and forge unforgettable memories within the vast worlds of role-playing games.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fb562b1ede4feb9fc02f0c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1795,1010,x0,y92,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 12:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/techcrunch-mobility-the-wheels-are-starting-to-come-off-the-fisker-ev-bus/,TechCrunch Mobility: The wheels are starting to come off the Fisker EV bus,"Welcome to TechCrunch Mobility, your go-to source for all things transportation. In this week's newsletter, we'll be covering some exciting updates and developments in the world of mobility.

Before we dive into the latest startup and tech news, let's talk about some recent activity on Capitol Hill. The Biden Administration has proposed two new standards through the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that will have a significant impact on U.S. automakers and consumers like you. While these regulations have been adjusted to accommodate the automotive industry, car dealers, and unions, they still impose stricter standards than before.

The DOE has introduced a ""petroleum equivalency factor,"" which assigns a score to electric vehicles (EVs) under the government's corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. The initial proposal would have made it challenging for automakers to meet these standards, resulting in hefty fines. On the other hand, the EPA has released tailpipe standards for 2027 to 2032 model year vehicles, which impose more stringent requirements on automakers but allow them flexibility in meeting the rules through various powertrains. These standards are technology-agnostic and do not mandate a complete shift to battery electric vehicles. They are also less demanding than the original proposal, which aimed for EVs to make up 67% of the total U.S. passenger vehicle market by 2032.

These new standards have limited implications for EV startups like Rivian, Tesla, and Lucid, as their vehicles already meet the clean car standard of a CO2 limit of 85 grams per mile by 2032. However, legacy automakers, who are investing heavily in EV development while still profiting from internal combustion engine vehicles, will face significant challenges. Plug-in hybrids may emerge as the winners in this scenario.

Now, let's move on to some exciting news from the world of mobility.

Clevon, a company specializing in autonomous delivery technology, was rumored to be struggling to secure new investments last month. However, it seems that the company is still operational and has entered into an exclusivity agreement for a merger with an American electric vehicle company. The merger is expected to be finalized in the first half of June. While Clevon has had to make some cost reductions and lay off employees, this development brings hope for its future.

In other news, Uber has made its first investment in an Africa-founded startup. Moove, an African mobility fintech company that provides vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers, recently raised $100 million in a Series B funding round led by Uber. With this investment, Moove is now valued at $750 million. This move aligns with Uber's commitment to achieving a fully zero-emission fleet by 2040, as Moove has made electric vehicles a core part of its business strategy.

Additionally, Amber, a Bay Area startup, has raised $3.18 million in a seed round for its aftermarket Tesla extended warranty product. Candela, an electric boat maker, secured $25 million in funding, and Pelikan Mobility, a French startup, has received funding for its mobility solutions.

These are just a few highlights from the world of mobility this week. Stay tuned for more exciting updates in our next newsletter.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/technology/article/moba-games/,Top Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) Games,"MOBAs, or multiplayer online battle arena games, have become incredibly popular over the past 15 years. Starting as a modification of a popular strategy game, the genre has evolved into standalone games that compete to be the best in the world. While many challengers have fallen by the wayside, the top MOBAs continue to attract millions of players every month. However, finding the best MOBA for you can still be a challenge if you don't know where to look.

So, what exactly is a multiplayer online battle arena game? A MOBA is an online game where two teams, usually consisting of five players each, battle against each other strategically to destroy the opponent's base using unique player-controlled characters. These games are typically played on PC or mobile devices and are known for their difficult-to-master gameplay.

The MOBA genre originated as a mod for Warcraft III, a popular strategy game with a thriving modding scene. The first MOBA, Defense of the Ancients (DotA), quickly gained popularity and became a major game in its own right. The team behind DotA eventually left to create their own MOBA, League of Legends, which was an instant hit. Valve, the developers of the Steam gaming platform, also got involved by hiring members of the original DotA team to create Dota 2, a competitor to League of Legends. This sparked a period where every major publisher attempted to create their own MOBA, but most failed to gain traction.

Over the years, hundreds of MOBAs have been released on various platforms. The top MOBA games today are the ones that have stood the test of time and have a large and loyal player base. These games have something unique to offer or have managed to capture an audience that continues to support them for years. Two of the biggest MOBAs, Dota 2 and League of Legends, have been around for over a decade and continue to innovate in a genre filled with copycats. These games have received critical acclaim and are considered the best of the best.

Dota 2, the direct sequel to the original DotA mod, has retained the spirit of its predecessor while becoming more accessible to a wider range of players. It has been one of the most popular games on Steam for over 10 years and continues to push the genre forward. While technically released in 2013, Dota 2 was available in beta form in 2011. Developed by Valve with the involvement of Ice Frog, the lead developer of the original DotA mod, Dota 2 has undergone significant changes over the years. These include map changes, new playable characters, and regular balance updates. Despite these changes, the core gameplay remains the same: two teams of five players battling across a three-lane map to destroy the enemy's Ancient and claim victory.

Dota 2 is known for its complexity. Compared to other MOBAs, it offers more variables in each match and has mechanics that take thousands of hours to master. Even experienced players admit that there are aspects of the game they still don't fully understand. If other MOBAs have become too easy for you, Dota 2 presents the ultimate challenge. The game is also free to play, with optional microtransactions for cosmetic items being the only form of payment.

League of Legends, on the other hand, is the biggest MOBA in the world, with over 100 million monthly active players. Its success has had a profound impact on the industry, inspiring numerous companies to create their own League of Legends clones. However, it is the original game that has stood the test of time. Developed by Riot Games, a company founded by a group of developers from the original DotA mod, League of Legends aimed to simplify some of the more complex aspects of DotA and make it more accessible for newcomers. The result is a slightly less complex version of the MOBA format, with the basic three-lane map and teams of five fighting to destroy the enemy's base. While it removed some of the less crucial complexities, it still offers a deep and engaging gameplay experience.

In conclusion, MOBAs have become a global phenomenon, offering unique gameplay experiences and attracting millions of players worldwide. While many MOBAs have come and gone, the top games in the genre continue to thrive and innovate. Dota 2 and League of Legends, in particular, have proven themselves as the best of the best, with dedicated fan bases and critical acclaim. Whether you're a seasoned player or new to the genre, these games offer challenging and rewarding experiences that are sure to keep you engaged for years to come.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fb05c9fa323af23f667c73/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 14:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
