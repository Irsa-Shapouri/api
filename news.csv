But before we dive into that, let me share a little confession with you. I have a secret desire to make rabbit pot pies on Easter one year. The combination of the savory dish and the sweet irony of using rabbit meat sounds absolutely delicious. But for now, let's focus on Wordle and have some fun.

If you're new to Wordle, it's a word puzzle game that has been gaining popularity recently. If you're interested, you can read more about it on my blog. But let's get to the main event - solving today's Wordle.

The hint for today is ""Useful when dry, useless when wet."" That's a great clue to get us started. And here's another clue: today's Wordle starts with a consonant. Are you ready for the answer? Here it is:

[Insert Answer]

Now, let's analyze today's Wordle. Every day, I check my Wordle Bot to see how well I did. It's always interesting to see the results. Today, my initial guess was ""chain,"" but that left me with a whopping 681 words. Not exactly what I was hoping for. So, I tried again and went with ""slope,"" which brought the number down to a much more manageable 19. And then, I decided to guess ""below,"" which actually turned out to be the correct answer. What a coincidence, considering today's Strands puzzle. Maybe there's some connection there?

Unfortunately, my competitive Wordle score for today is a total wash. I didn't score any points for guessing in four tries, and I didn't tie with the Bot either. Zeroes all around! But hey, there's always tomorrow, right?

Now, let's take a moment to delve into the etymology of the word ""towel."" It has an interesting history that dates back to the 13th century. The word ""towel"" can be traced back to the Old French term ""touaille,"" which means a piece of cloth used for drying or wiping. This Old French word is believed to have originated from the Medieval Latin term ""tovaglia,"" which likely came from the Latin word ""tubicula,"" a diminutive form of ""tuba,"" meaning ""tube"" or ""cloth.""

The transformation of ""touaille"" into ""towel"" showcases the linguistic influence of Norman French on the English language after the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. Over time, many words of French origin underwent pronunciation and spelling changes as they were Anglicized. This process led to the modern English word ""towel"" that we use today. Throughout history, towels have been an essential item in households, evolving in material and use, but always serving the same purpose - drying or wiping.

In this week's highlights, we have some major developments in the Apple antitrust lawsuit and Microsoft's AI ambitions. So, let's dive right in!

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has joined international regulators in accusing Apple of using monopolistic tactics to lock in iPhone users. Apple, in response, argues that the DOJ's actions could jeopardize the very things that make its phones and ecosystem so enjoyable for users.

Although the DOJ's lawsuit draws a comparison between Apple and Microsoft in the 1990s, there are notable differences between the two companies and their approaches to retaining customers. However, experts predict that it could take several years, possibly three to five, for the lawsuit to reach a resolution.

Moving on to other news, Microsoft made headlines this week by acquiring the co-founders of the AI startup, Inflection AI. Mustafa Suleyman will now lead the consumer-facing unit Microsoft AI, while Karén Simonyan takes on the role of EVP and CEO of the same group. This move comes after Inflection raised an impressive $1.3 billion, with Microsoft being one of its major investors.

Nvidia also made waves with its GTC event. In addition to their well-known ray tracing technology, CEO Jensen Huang made surprising announcements. He predicted that artificial general intelligence would be achievable within five years and unveiled a new AI platform called GR00T, designed specifically for humanoid robots.

In a potential collaboration, Google and Apple are reportedly in talks to deploy Google's AI model to power upcoming iOS updates. The nature of this partnership remains uncertain, but it raises questions about whether it will be a temporary solution or a long-term collaboration.

On the topic of hacking and privacy, the Biden administration is rallying an international coalition to combat commercial spyware. Interestingly, it has been discovered that one of the investors involved in this effort was previously involved in the very business they are now fighting against.

In the gaming world, a hack temporarily disrupted an Apex Legends tournament. The motive behind the hack was simply to highlight the exploit used and draw attention to developers.

Glassdoor, the popular job review platform, faced some controversy this week. Users reported that their real names were being added to their profiles without their consent. The only solution provided to them was to delete their accounts entirely, prompting users to be cautious about their privacy on the platform.

Shifting focus to funding and IPOs, Reddit had a successful IPO with its stock jumping 48% on its first day of trading. Astera Labs, a company specializing in connectivity hardware for cloud computing data centers, also experienced a positive debut, with its stock closing at $62.03 on day one.

In other funding news, The Browser Company raised $50 million at a valuation of $550 million. The company, behind the Arc browser, has an ambitious plan to replace PCs with browsers, but its path to monetization remains unclear.

To round things up, we'll touch on some additional topics. AI-generated images often have spelling errors, highlighting the fact that AI still struggles with spelling accuracy. Fisker, an EV manufacturer, has paused production due to financial difficulties. And despite the challenges of reviewing systems like ChatGPT or Gemini, it is crucial to subject them to testing and evaluation.

That concludes this Week in Review. Stay tuned for more exciting updates in the tech industry.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/apple-antitrust-doj-splash.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-23 20:15:37,Innovation,Innovation

In the fast-paced world of combat sports, unexpected incidents can occur, as demonstrated by the recent UFC Fight Night: Ribas vs. Namajunas event. Making his UFC debut, Igor Severino shocked viewers when he bit his fellow Brazilian opponent, Andre Lima, during their preliminary fight in the second round.

The disqualification came swiftly after images revealed clear bite marks on Lima's arm, a shocking and unsportsmanlike act by Severino. The incident occurred during a standing grappling position, tarnishing what could have been a promising start for the 20-year-old in the UFC.

Severino's actions not only resulted in his first career loss, dropping his record to 9-1, but also led to immediate repercussions from UFC CEO Dana White, who promptly cut ties with the young fighter. White emphasized the severity of Severino's actions, stating that there are better ways to handle frustration in a fight than resorting to biting, a move that now jeopardizes Severino's future in the promotion and could lead to further consequences with the NSAC.

Biting in combat sports is a rare but egregious offense, and Severino's actions have undoubtedly tarnished his reputation in the MMA community. Despite Lima's composed reaction to the incident, Severino will need to rebuild his credibility through smaller promotions before earning another shot at competing in prominent organizations like the UFC or the Professional Fighters League.

As the dust settles on Saturday's events in Las Vegas, fans can expect more traditional fight results to emerge. The unexpected drama of Severino's bite serves as a reminder of the intense pressure and unpredictable nature of combat sports, where split-second decisions can have lasting consequences.

This partnership exemplifies the crucial role of public health workers in safeguarding communities.
The analogy of an offensive line in football, often overlooked unless they make mistakes, mirrors the unnoticed efforts of public health professionals. The upcoming PBS series, The Invisible Shield, sheds light on the vital yet underappreciated work of the public health system. Premiering on March 26 at 10 pm, the series aims to raise awareness of the essential role of public health in protecting individuals and communities.
The title of the series, The Invisible Shield, captures the proactive measures taken by the public health system to shield the population from various health threats. However, the term “invisible” underscores the lack of visibility and recognition given to public health efforts amidst other sensationalized news topics. As Dr. Kelly Henning, Public Health Program Lead for Bloomberg Philanthropies, emphasizes in the series, effective public health work often goes unnoticed.
The Covid-19 pandemic exposed the vulnerabilities of underfunded and undervalued public health systems worldwide. The crisis highlighted the critical need for robust support and resources to combat infectious diseases like SARS-CoV-2 effectively. Despite brief acknowledgments of the importance of public health during the pandemic, sustained investment and commitment to the public health infrastructure remain lacking.
The collaboration between RadicalMedia and Bloomberg Philanthropies to produce The Invisible Shield underscores the urgency of promoting public health awareness. Amidst the noise of celebrity endorsements and commercial promotions, public health initiatives often go unnoticed. The series aims to educate viewers on the significant impact of public health interventions, such as vaccination programs, sanitation efforts, and disease prevention measures.
In the spirit of raising public health awareness, the first episode of The Invisible Shield, titled “The Old Playbook,” delves into the historical advancements in public health that have doubled life expectancy since 1900. However, it also highlights the current challenges facing the public health system, emphasizing the need for sustained support and innovation to prevent its collapse.
As Dr. Josh Sharfstein, Distinguished Professor at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, aptly summarizes, “Public health saved your life today, but you didn’t even know it.” The series serves as a reminder of the indispensable role of public health in safeguarding individual and community well-being. Through engaging storytelling and informative narratives, The Invisible Shield aims to elevate public health discourse and inspire collective action towards strengthening public health infrastructure.
The Invisible Shield offers a compelling glimpse into the intricate workings of the public health system and its profound impact on society. By highlighting the unsung heroes of public health and their tireless dedication to protecting public health, the series invites viewers to appreciate the invaluable contributions of public health professionals in preserving health and well-being.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff76b9cc324c33ed5484d7/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-23 21:25:08,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/23/explained-the-difference-between-a-solar-eclipse-and-a-lunar-eclipse/,Explained: The Difference Between A Solar Eclipse And A Lunar Eclipse,"Do you know the distinction between a solar eclipse and a lunar eclipse? In the following weeks, two eclipses will take place—the first being a lunar eclipse on Monday, March 25, and the second a solar eclipse on Monday, April 8. Although they are distinct events, they both occur due to the same celestial alignment.

A lunar eclipse occurs when Earth's shadow is cast on the moon, while a solar eclipse happens when the moon obstructs the sun's light, resulting in a shadow on Earth. However, both types of eclipses are infrequent due to the slight variation in the orbital planes of the Earth and the moon around the sun.

What triggers a lunar eclipse is the alignment of the sun, Earth, and moon, with Earth situated between the sun and the moon. This positioning projects a shadow into space. While full moons occur every 29 days, lunar eclipses are rare as the moon seldom passes through Earth's shadow. When it does, a lunar eclipse occurs.

On the other hand, a solar eclipse can only take place during a new moon, when the moon is positioned between the sun and Earth, projecting a shadow onto Earth. New moons occur every 29 days, two weeks after a full moon. However, the moon rarely obscures the sun from Earth's perspective. When it does, a solar eclipse occurs.

A total lunar eclipse is caused by a precise alignment of the sun, Earth, and moon. Earth has two shadows—the outer penumbral shadow and the central umbral shadow. When a full moon enters Earth's umbra, it receives no direct sunlight. The only light reaching its surface is sunlight refracted by Earth's atmosphere. This creates a mesmerizing effect of a thousand sunsets on the lunar surface, resulting in a pinkish-red hue—a ""Blood Moon."" If one were to stand on the moon during a lunar eclipse, they would be bathed in a pinkish-red glow and witness a partial or total solar eclipse.

On March 25, there will be a penumbral lunar eclipse as the full ""Worm Moon"" passes through Earth's penumbra.

A total solar eclipse is caused by a perfect alignment of the sun, moon, and Earth, along with a celestial fluke. During a new moon, two shadows are cast—the fuzzy outer penumbral shadow and the dark central umbral shadow. When the moon entirely blocks the sun, which is only possible due to its size being 400 times smaller than the sun yet 400 times closer to Earth, its umbra is projected onto Earth.

The moon's shadow moves across Earth's surface as it orbits from west to east, which aligns with Earth's rotation. This synchronicity slows down the movement of the moon's shadow, creating a path of totality known as the umbral shadow. Those within this path witness an extraordinary sight—a total solar eclipse. If one were to stand on the moon during a total solar eclipse, they would witness the moon's shadow crossing Earth.

On April 8, there will be a total solar eclipse as the new ""Pink Moon"" perfectly blocks the sun, projecting an umbral shadow over North America.

The rarity of both lunar and solar eclipses can be attributed to the moon's orbit around Earth, which is tilted about 5 degrees with respect to the sun's path. This means that the moon's path intersects the sun's path twice in each orbit, occurring every month. However, for an eclipse to occur, the moon must be at its new or full phase. This scenario transpires twice a year, resulting in two ""eclipse seasons"" when both solar and lunar eclipses take place. Nevertheless, most solar eclipses are either partial or annular, while most lunar eclipses are penumbral or partial.

In 2024, there will be two ""eclipse seasons,"" commencing on March 25 and September 17, with the following eclipses occurring:
- March 25, 2024: Penumbral lunar eclipse (visible in North America)
- April 8, 2024: Total solar eclipse (visible in North America)
- September 17, 2024: Partial lunar eclipse (visible in North America)
- October 2, 2024: Annular solar eclipse (visible in the Pacific Ocean and South America)

In 2025, two ""eclipse seasons"" will take place, starting on March 13 and September 7, with the following eclipses occurring:
- March 13, 2025: Total lunar eclipse (visible in North America)
- March 29, 2025: Partial solar eclipse (visible in Canada and northern Europe)
- September 7, 2025: Total lunar eclipse (visible in Asia)
- September 21, 2025: Partial solar eclipse (visible in Antarctica)

Have you ever thought you witnessed a total solar eclipse? Chances are, you actually saw a partial eclipse. Only one in 10,000 people have experienced totality, where the sun is completely blocked by the moon. It's an unforgettable moment that you cherish for a lifetime.

The ""Great American Eclipse"" in 2017 brought totality to 12 U.S. states, captivating millions with its beauty. If you were lucky enough to be on the path of totality, you would remember the surreal twilight sky, the moon's silhouette, and the mesmerizing sun's corona shining around it.

If you're unsure about your eclipse memory, check the Solar Eclipses Visibility Database for confirmation. Here's a list of total solar eclipses in North America over the last 70 years. If you weren't within the designated path, you likely saw a partial eclipse.

Next year, on April 8, 2024, a once-in-a-lifetime total solar eclipse will grace North America. This time, 42 million people, including 32 million Americans, will have the opportunity to witness totality. The narrow path of totality will cross parts of Mexico, the U.S., and Canada, offering a unique experience for those within its boundaries.

Introduction:
Air pollution is a pressing issue that affects millions of people around the world. On red air days, the toxic taste of polluted air can sting our noses and lungs, prompting health advisories to stay indoors. While there are various sources of air pollution, one major contributor is the emissions from internal combustion engines fueled by gas or diesel. In the United States, transportation, particularly light-duty vehicles, is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. To address this problem and ensure cleaner air for all, we must focus on reducing tailpipe pollution through the implementation of stricter emissions standards. 

The EPA's Historic Move:
Recently, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) took a significant step in tackling air pollution by adopting new multi-pollutant rules for light-duty and smaller medium-duty vehicles. These updated standards will limit tailpipe pollution, which not only poisons the air we breathe but also exacerbates climate change. By compelling automakers to adopt cleaner technologies, these standards pave the way for a future where new vehicles will be cleaner than ever before.

The Choice for Cleaner Air:
Cleaner air is a fundamental right that everyone, regardless of their location, should have. By embracing electric vehicles, we can significantly reduce pollution levels and create a healthier environment. Americans who are passionate about reducing pollution deserve the freedom to choose clean cars as their next mode of transportation.

The Impact of Air Pollution:
Air pollution affects a staggering 36 percent of the U.S. population, equating to nearly 120 million people. Unhealthy levels of pollution can hinder lung development in children and lead to respiratory diseases such as asthma, emphysema, and chronic bronchitis. It is important to note that people of color and lower-income individuals are disproportionately affected by air pollution, exacerbating existing health and social inequality.

Dispelling Misinformation:
Unfortunately, corporations that profit from the sale of polluting vehicles and petroleum have launched campaigns to undermine the EPA's efforts. They claim that these updated standards impede American freedoms and consumer choice. However, this is far from the truth. The EPA's standards are not a ban on gas cars; rather, they are technology-neutral and performance-based. These standards are backed by scientific research and aim to protect public health and welfare, as directed by the Clean Air Act.

The Evolution of Emissions Standards:
The Clean Air Act, enacted in 1970, empowered the EPA to establish National Ambient Air Quality Standards and regulate hazardous air pollutant emissions. Over the years, emissions standards for light-duty vehicles have driven the development of innovative engine and emission control technologies. These advancements, such as the catalytic converter and the switch to unleaded fuel, have significantly reduced hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide emissions.

The Impact of Clean Air Regulations:
Before the Clean Air Act, cities like New York and Los Angeles suffered from severe air pollution, with New York's air being as harmful as smoking two packs of cigarettes a day. However, through the implementation of regulations, air quality has improved. Today, we must continue this progress by continuously adapting and enhancing emissions standards to ensure cleaner air for future generations.

Conclusion:
The battle against air pollution is far from over, but with the adoption of stricter tailpipe emissions standards, we are taking a crucial step forward. By prioritizing cleaner vehicles and embracing electric alternatives, we can protect public health, combat climate change, and create a more sustainable future. Let us celebrate this milestone and work together to ensure that every breath we take is of clean, fresh air.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fe401fc35aefb76700b52e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 07:45:00,Innovation,Innovation

A recent study involving over 200,000 individuals diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has shed light on the positive impact of ADHD stimulant medications. The research, conducted by Heidi Taipale and her team at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, revealed that individuals prescribed ADHD medications had a lower risk of suicide attempts and psychiatric hospitalizations.

The study identified four specific ADHD medications—amphetamine, lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate—as being associated with a reduced risk of psychiatric hospitalizations. Furthermore, the use of lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate was linked to a decreased risk of suicidal behavior.

It is crucial to note that individuals with ADHD often have co-existing psychiatric conditions, with a prevalence of 52% compared to 7% in those without ADHD. These comorbidities can include major depressive disorder, panic disorder, substance abuse, generalized anxiety disorder, and more, significantly impacting the overall health and well-being of individuals with ADHD.

Interestingly, while atomoxetine did not show a lower risk of psychiatric hospitalizations or suicidal behavior, it was associated with fewer hospitalizations for non-psychiatric comorbidities. This underscores the complexity of managing ADHD and the importance of tailoring treatment approaches to individual needs.

The study's findings highlight the overall beneficial impact of ADHD medications on psychiatric outcomes, such as reducing the risk of depression and suicide. However, concerns about potential adverse effects, including cardiovascular risks and the possibility of psychosis or mania, warrant further investigation.

The study, published in JAMA Network Open on March 20, 2024, provides valuable insights into the long-term effectiveness and safety of ADHD pharmacotherapies. By understanding the specific benefits and risks associated with different medications, healthcare providers can better support individuals with ADHD in managing their symptoms and improving their quality of life.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/63c28dbb82c31b7412c92cf2/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 04:09:46,Innovation,Innovation
