https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/techcrunch-mobility-the-wheels-are-starting-to-come-off-the-fisker-ev-bus/,TechCrunch Mobility: The wheels are starting to come off the Fisker EV bus,"TechCrunch Mobility is a weekly newsletter that provides news and insights on the future of transportation. In this edition, we will be discussing some recent developments in the automotive industry, as well as highlighting a few interesting startups in the space. So let's jump right in!

First, let's talk about the Biden Administration's proposed standards for U.S. automakers. The Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have released separate regulations that will have a significant impact on the industry. While the regulations have been softened to accommodate the automotive industry, they still impose stricter standards than before.

The DOE's proposal introduces a ""petroleum equivalency factor"" that gives electric vehicles (EVs) a score under the government's corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. This is a significant change that could have resulted in hefty fines for automakers. However, the DOE has made adjustments to make compliance more manageable.

On the other hand, the EPA's tailpipe standards for 2027 to 2032 model year vehicles will require automakers to meet stiffer requirements. However, the rules are technology agnostic, meaning that automakers have flexibility in meeting them. This is a departure from the original proposal, which would have mandated a high percentage of EV sales by 2032.

While these regulations have implications for legacy automakers, they don't have a significant impact on EV startups like Rivian, Tesla, and Lucid. These companies already meet the clean car standards and are well-positioned in the market. However, plug-in hybrids might be the real winners here, as they offer a balance between electric and internal combustion engine vehicles.

Now, let's shift our focus to some exciting startups in the transportation space. One company that caught our attention is Clevon, which has been developing autonomous delivery technology since 2018. Despite some initial struggles, the company has secured funding and is now in the process of merging with an American electric vehicle company. This partnership could be a game-changer for Clevon and propel them to new heights.

In other news, Moove, an African mobility fintech startup, recently raised $100 million in a Series B funding round led by Uber. Moove provides vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers and aligns with Uber's commitment to a zero-emission fleet by 2040. This investment marks Uber's first foray into the African startup scene and highlights the growing importance of the region in the mobility sector.

Lastly, we have Amber, a Bay Area startup that offers an aftermarket Tesla extended warranty product. The company recently raised $3.18 million in a seed round, indicating a strong interest in their offering. This demonstrates the market's demand for innovative solutions in the electric vehicle space.

These are just a few examples of the exciting developments happening in the transportation industry. As we move towards a more sustainable and connected future, it's crucial to keep an eye on the latest trends and innovations. Stay tuned for more updates on TechCrunch Mobility as we continue to explore the future of transportation.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1363022906.jpg?resize=1200,730",2024-03-24 19:00:33,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-deep-geothermal-renewable-powerhouse.html,Dig deep: US bets on geothermal to become renewable powerhouse,"Geothermal energy has the potential to become a major player in the green energy transition, according to experts. Although it currently only accounts for a small percentage of US energy production, advancements in technology and growing interest from businesses and the Biden administration could change that.

Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm recently spoke at the CERAWeek conference in Houston, highlighting the benefits of geothermal energy. She stated that if we can tap into the heat beneath our feet, it can provide clean, reliable, and scalable power for industries and households alike. The Department of Energy predicts that by 2050, geothermal energy could surpass hydroelectric and solar power in the US.

Geothermal energy utilizes the high temperatures naturally found underground to generate electricity and heat buildings. However, in 2022, it only made up 1.6% of US energy consumption. To increase production, the US government has invested over $200 million since 2018 in an experimental site in Utah. This project involves drilling exceptionally deep wells and implementing Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) technology.

EGS technology differs from traditional geothermal energy extraction methods. It involves injecting water into very hot rocks, often located more than two miles underground. This approach eliminates the need for nearby hot springs or underground reservoirs. Francesco d'Avack, an analyst with S&P Global Commodity Insights, explains that geothermal energy has the potential to be developed anywhere and reduces the upfront risk associated with drilling.

To further incentivize geothermal energy production, the US government is allowing companies to convert permits for oil or gas exploration into geothermal licenses. This reduces paperwork and delays. Additionally, the Energy Department states that EGS uses fewer chemical additives than traditional fracking methods and does not release hydrocarbons.

One significant advantage of geothermal energy is its ability to provide a steady flow of energy regardless of the weather or time of day, unlike solar or wind power. The Energy Department estimates that the cost of geothermal energy will decrease from the current range of $70 to $100 per megawatt hour to $45 by 2035. Existing drilling technology makes geothermal energy quicker and cheaper to develop. This new application has been a significant breakthrough, referred to as a ""big unlock"" by Jigar Shah of the Energy Department's loan office.

While there are experimental EGS sites in other countries, the US has been a leader in implementing this technology. However, there are potential risks associated with geothermal drilling, including induced seismicity. The US Energy Department requires all funded projects to follow a mitigation protocol to address this issue.

Despite the challenges, several US and Canadian start-ups have raised significant funding and are competing in the geothermal energy market. Fervo Energy, for example, partnered with Google to connect its Nevada site to the electric grid. As the demand for geothermal energy grows, major companies like Google, Microsoft, and Nucor are purchasing geothermal energy and are willing to pay a premium for it.

The geothermal energy sector is still relatively small, but there is immense potential for growth. Cindy Taff, CEO of Sage Geosystems, believes that once the first successful commercial facility is established, others will follow suit. The primary focus now is to develop the sector correctly and sustainably.

In conclusion, geothermal energy has the potential to become a significant contributor to the green energy transition. Technological advancements and government support are driving the growth of this sector. With its ability to provide clean, reliable, and constant energy, geothermal energy could play a crucial role in reducing reliance on fossil fuels and mitigating climate change.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/a-worker-operates-a-dr.jpg,2024-03-25 04:59:03,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/03/25/adopting-ai-legislation-and-best-practices/,Adopting AI Legislation And Best Practices,"The global AI market is rapidly expanding, with a projected worth of $1.81 trillion by 2030. However, legislation has failed to keep pace with this growth, leading to debates and controversy over the appropriate role of AI. In order to fully understand the issue and take appropriate action, it is crucial to explore the topic of AI legislation and consider what companies can do in the meantime.

The need for legislation becomes evident when we examine incidents like the Taylor Swift deepfake case. As AI technology advances, it becomes increasingly easy to create fake photos, videos, and even phone calls, often resulting in disastrous consequences. Additionally, copyright concerns arise due to the vast amount of data required for training AI systems. Experts and critics disagree on the definition of fair use when it comes to AI's consumption and learning from copyrighted material. Should AI companies compensate the original authors, or does fair use apply? And where is the line between fair use and copyright infringement? These complex questions can only be answered through legislation, which will provide clarity and a clear path for future development.

While these issues are being addressed in court cases, it is crucial for companies to establish best practices to govern AI use. One important step is to upskill employees and provide them with the necessary training to understand the capabilities and limitations of AI, as well as the associated risks. This is particularly important when it comes to handling internal company data, as demonstrated by Samsung's ban on using ChatGPT after a leak of sensitive code occurred. Educating employees on proper AI usage and data protection is essential.

Using internal AI models instead of widely available options is another effective strategy for protecting data. By internalizing the architecture, companies can ensure data segregation and customize the model according to their specific needs. This provides an added layer of security and control.

Addressing bias is another critical aspect of responsible AI usage. AI systems can inadvertently perpetuate racial and gender biases if the training data lacks diversity. To mitigate this, companies must ensure that their training data is diverse and representative. Regular tests should be conducted to identify any biases that may have crept into the models, allowing for adjustments to be made as needed.

Furthermore, it is important to continually evaluate AI usage. AI is not a ""set-it-and-forget-it"" technology. As the field evolves, organizations must adapt and make necessary adjustments to training data, access policies, and regulatory compliance. This ongoing evaluation ensures that AI systems remain effective, ethical, and aligned with evolving legislation.

While AI legislation is being developed in multiple jurisdictions, the current landscape is still akin to the Wild West. Until regulations catch up with reality, it falls upon companies to self-regulate and adhere to best practices for their own benefit and that of their customers.

It is worth mentioning that the Forbes Technology Council is an exclusive community for top-tier CIOs, CTOs, and technology executives. Membership is by invitation only and offers a platform for industry leaders to share insights and expertise.

In conclusion, the exponential growth of the AI market necessitates legislation to ensure responsible and ethical usage. Companies must take steps to upskill employees, use internal AI models, address bias, and continually evaluate their AI systems. While waiting for legislation to catch up, self-regulation and adherence to best practices are vital. By doing so, companies can navigate the complex AI landscape and protect their interests and those of their customers.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fde85c0195d22e6b3dd766/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 09:30:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/03/25/netflix-is-in-a-bind-with-3-body-problem-season-2/,Netflix Is In A Bind With ‘3 Body Problem’ Season 2,"Netflix's latest sci-fi series, 3 Body Problem, has made quite an impact since its debut. Currently sitting at #2 on the top 10 list in the US, the show has left viewers eager for a second season. However, the fate of the show is uncertain, given the various factors at play.

3 Body Problem is an adaptation of the renowned book trilogy by Cixin Liu, consisting of The Three-Body Problem, The Dark Forest, and Death's End. Just like the three-body problem itself, these books are interconnected, and it would be challenging to continue the series without all three seasons. Surprisingly, Netflix did not announce a renewal for the show, leaving fans wondering if a second season will happen.

This show holds significant importance for Netflix, as it is a high-profile and expensive sci-fi project. While Netflix has had success with shows like Stranger Things, they have generally left sci-fi to platforms like Apple TV+. Given the critical acclaim of the book series and the involvement of David Benioff and DB Weiss, the creators of Game of Thrones, expectations are sky-high.

In terms of reception, 3 Body Problem has received mixed reviews. Critics have given it a 76% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, which is good but not exceptional. User scores, on the other hand, have been less positive, with a 64% rating. Ultimately, audience reception plays a crucial role in determining a show's success.

Currently, 3 Body Problem is ranked below a true crime show called Homicide New York on Netflix's US Top 10 list. While it's still early, a strong show typically debuts at #1 or relies on word-of-mouth to climb up the rankings. However, given the complex and high-concept nature of 3 Body Problem, it remains to be seen if it will generate enough buzz. Additionally, the show's cost is a significant factor. While a cheaper show lower down the list might have a chance at renewal, a sprawling sci-fi epic like 3 Body Problem needs to perform exceptionally well.

The decision for Netflix is a challenging one. On one hand, 3 Body Problem is a critical project with renowned talent attached. On the other hand, the lukewarm reception raises doubts about its future. Netflix will have to carefully consider their commitment to the show and weigh the risks and rewards.

Update (3/25): 3 Body Problem has managed to reach the #1 spot on Netflix's Top 10 list, which bodes well for its chances of a second season. However, the actual viewership numbers are still unknown. The creators of the show have given interviews hinting at a potential season 2, but nothing has been confirmed yet.

Interestingly, 3 Body Problem holds the title of Netflix's most expensive scripted series, with each episode costing a staggering $20 million. This price tag was surprising, considering the show's production value. With Weiss and Benioff's Netflix deal costing at least $200 million, Netflix may be more reluctant to cancel the show. Additionally, the clear three-book arc of the trilogy provides a strong incentive to see it through to the end. However, the cost implications cannot be ignored. If each season consists of eight episodes, the total cost for the trilogy would amount to half a billion dollars.

In conclusion, it seems that Netflix is heavily invested in 3 Body Problem, even if it underperforms. While there are concerns about its reception, the potential for a second season is still on the table. As the show progresses, we will have a clearer picture of its future.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff099745aba0c0732fa9e9/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 08:59:52,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/apple-sued-microsofts-ai-ambitions-and-nvidia-surprises/,"Apple sued, Microsoft's AI ambitions and Nvidia's surprises","Welcome to this edition of Week in Review, where we bring you the latest news and updates in the tech world. In this edition, we have some big news on the Apple antitrust lawsuit and Microsoft's AI ambitions. So let's dive right in!

First up, the U.S. has joined international regulators in accusing Apple of using monopolistic tactics to lock in iPhone users. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has filed a lawsuit against Apple, claiming that its actions could harm what users enjoy about its phones and ecosystem. This lawsuit draws a comparison between Apple and Microsoft in the 1990s, although there are some key differences between the two companies and their efforts to retain customers. However, experts predict that it could take three to five years for the lawsuit to reach a resolution, so don't expect any immediate outcomes.

Moving on to Microsoft, the tech giant made headlines this week with its acquisition of Inflection AI. The co-founders of the AI startup, Mustafa Suleyman and Karén Simonyan, have joined Microsoft in key positions. Suleyman is now the lead of the consumer-facing unit Microsoft AI, while Simonyan is the EVP and CEO of the same group. This acquisition comes after Inflection raised $1.3 billion, with Microsoft being the biggest investor. It's a significant move for Microsoft's AI ambitions.

Next, let's talk about Nvidia's GTC event. In this wide-ranging developer conference, Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang made some surprising announcements. He predicted that artificial general intelligence is just five years away, which is an exciting prospect. Additionally, Nvidia unveiled a new AI platform called GR00T, specifically designed for humanoid robots. These developments show that Nvidia is continuing to push the boundaries of AI technology.

In other news, Google and Apple are reportedly in talks regarding the deployment of Google's AI model on iPhones. This collaboration could potentially power several upcoming iOS updates. It remains to be seen whether this will be a temporary solution or a long-term partnership. Regardless, it's an interesting development in the world of AI.

Now let's shift our focus to hacking and privacy. The Biden administration is forming an international coalition to combat commercial spyware. Interestingly, some investors who are now part of this coalition were previously involved in the very business they are now fighting against. It's a noteworthy turn of events and highlights the need for stronger cybersecurity measures.

In gaming news, a recent hack disrupted an Apex Legends tournament. The hackers claimed that they did it ""for fun"" and to draw attention to the exploit they used. It serves as a reminder of the ongoing battle between hackers and developers in the gaming community.

On the topic of privacy, Glassdoor users have reported that their real names are being added to their profiles without their consent. The only solution provided to them is to delete their accounts entirely. It's a concerning issue that warrants attention and caution when sharing personal information online.

In funding and IPO news, Reddit's IPO had a strong start. The stock jumped 48% on its first day of trading, closing at $46 after the market closed on Friday. This success reflects the growing interest in the company and its potential for future growth.

Another company, Astera Labs, experienced a successful IPO as well. The company, which specializes in connectivity hardware for cloud computing data centers, saw its stock close at $62.03 on its first day. This success can be attributed to the booming AI industry and the increasing demand for cloud computing solutions.

In other funding news, The Browser Company raised $50 million at a valuation of $550 million. The startup behind the Arc browser has an ambitious goal of supplanting PCs with browsers. While their path to monetization remains unclear, they continue to launch new features and updates, making them an interesting player in the browser market.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/dma-first-formal-probes/,"Apple, Google and Meta face first formal investigations under EU's DMA","The European Union has recently announced a series of investigations on Big Tech companies, including Alphabet/Google, Apple, and Meta. These investigations are being conducted under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which designates gatekeepers in the digital market. Alphabet/Google is being investigated for its rules on steering in Google Play and self-preferencing in search results. Apple is being scrutinized for its rules on steering in the App Store and the design of choice screens for alternative browsers. Meta's ""pay or consent"" model will also be examined by the EU.

These three gatekeepers, which were designated under the pan-EU regulation last year, are facing formal investigations to determine if they are breaching the rulebook. Violations of the DMA can result in fines of up to 10% of global annual turnover, or even 20% for repeat offenses. The EU will have up to 12 months to conclude the investigations, with a preliminary report expected within six months.

This enforcement action by the EU comes as antitrust scrutiny on these three US firms continues to increase on their home turf as well. Since the companies unveiled their DMA compliance plans, there has been criticism that the proposals do not comply with the new EU law.

For example, Google has been accused of launching new rich features in search results that unfairly compete with rivals, in an attempt to avoid the regulation's ban on self-preferencing. Apple's use of notifications to warn users of risks outside its ecosystem has been criticized by developers as ""scare screens."" Meta's ""pay or be tracked"" tactic has been condemned by privacy and consumer rights groups.

The Commission has opened proceedings to assess whether Alphabet and Apple's measures pertaining to their app stores are in breach of the DMA. The Commission is concerned about the restrictions and limitations imposed by these companies, which may prevent developers from freely communicating, promoting offers, and concluding contracts.

Regarding Google's self-preferencing, the investigation will focus on its vertical search services and the impact on rival services. The EU is concerned that Alphabet's measures may not treat third-party services on Google's search results page in a fair and non-discriminatory manner.

In the case of Apple, the EU will examine whether it is complying with user choice obligations on iOS, including the ability to uninstall apps, change default settings, and select alternative default services. The Commission is concerned that Apple's measures, including the design of the web browser choice screen, may prevent users from truly exercising their choice of services within the Apple ecosystem.

As for Meta, the proceedings will investigate whether its ""pay or consent"" model for EU users complies with the DMA. The EU is concerned that this model may not provide a real alternative for users who do not consent, thereby not achieving the objective of preventing the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers.

Margrethe Vestager, the Commission EVP in charge of competition policy, stated that the suggested solutions put forward by the three companies may not fully comply with the DMA. The Commission aims to ensure open and contestable digital markets in Europe through these investigations.

The Digital Markets Act became applicable on March 7th, and discussions with gatekeepers have been ongoing to help them adapt. While changes are already happening in the market, the EU is not convinced that the solutions proposed by Alphabet, Apple, and Meta are sufficient. The investigations will shed light on the companies' compliance with the DMA and contribute to the establishment of fair digital markets in Europe.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1031626648.jpg?resize=1200,799",2024-03-25 12:10:10,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/spotify-courses-learning/,Spotify tests video courses to teach everything from music production to Excel,"Spotify, known for its music streaming and podcast services, is now venturing into the world of e-learning. The company is testing an online education offering in the U.K., partnering with organizations like the BBC and Skillshare to provide freemium video courses. While at least two lessons will be free, the cost of a full course will range from £20 to £80 on average. These prices will remain the same for both basic and premium users, at least for now.

Mohit Jitani, the product director for Spotify's education business, stated that the pricing choices are part of the company's testing phase before considering wider rollout. ""With this launch, we're trying to understand the demand first,"" Jitani explained. ""Then we optimize how we can make it more compelling and exciting.""

The e-learning content will be accessible through Spotify's home and browse tabs under the ""Courses"" section. Users can access the courses via the web or the Spotify mobile app. The courses cover a wide range of subjects, from music production to Excel skills. Additionally, there are lessons on creating online learning content, targeting musicians and others interested in becoming ""education creators.""

While there are already numerous online learning sites available, Spotify's educational push focuses on one-directional, on-demand video content. Some courses may include supplementary materials, such as additional documents, but interactive elements like tests or other forms of engagement are not currently part of the offering.

Spotify has partnered with Skillshare, PLAYvirtuoso, BBC Maestro, and Thinkific for its Courses program. The company plans to curate the courses based on user preferences and interests. Spotify will analyze what users are already listening to and searching for on its platform to determine the most popular topics and find the best content to offer.

The videos in the Courses program are owned by third-party publishers, who license them to Spotify. However, the videos will be hosted and purchased directly on Spotify's platform. The revenue generated from course sales will be shared among the creator, publisher, and Spotify. Content partners will handle the payments to creators, although the exact revenue share breakdown has not been disclosed.

So why is Spotify entering the education space, and why did it choose the U.K. for its initial launch? The move aligns with Spotify's strategy of diversifying its business and working towards consistent profitability and stronger margins. The U.K. was chosen due to its large market size and high user engagement.

While Spotify has faced financial challenges in recent years, including layoffs and periods of unprofitability, the company sees potential in the online learning and professional development market. Spotify's podcasting business has provided valuable data on user preferences, revealing a strong correlation between popular podcasts and education content. Around half of Spotify Premium subscribers have listened to education or self-help themed podcasts. Leveraging its recommendation algorithms, Spotify aims to cross-promote podcasts and paid courses, believing that one can help sell the other.

By entering the e-learning market, Spotify continues to expand its offerings and tap into new revenue streams. As the company tests its educational platform in the U.K., it will gather valuable insights to refine and improve the service before potentially expanding it globally. With its vast user base and data-driven approach, Spotify is poised to make a significant impact in the e-learning industry.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Courses-on-Spotify-PR-Image-6-2.png?resize=1200,683",2024-03-25 08:59:18,Innovation,Innovation
