A recent study conducted at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, has found that individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) who were prescribed ADHD stimulant medications had a lower risk of attempting suicide or dying by suicide. The study, which included over 221,000 adults and adolescents with ADHD, also revealed that the use of ADHD medications was associated with fewer psychiatric hospitalizations.

The researchers, led by Heidi Taipale, examined the effects of four ADHD medications on psychiatric co-morbidities and suicidal behavior. They found that the use of amphetamine, lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate was linked to a decreased risk of psychiatric hospitalizations. In addition, lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate were associated with a lower risk of suicidal behavior.

Previous research conducted in Sweden in 2019 showed that individuals with ADHD had a significantly higher prevalence of psychiatric co-morbidities compared to those without ADHD. The prevalence of psychiatric co-morbidities was found to be 52% among individuals with ADHD, while it was only 7% among individuals without ADHD. These co-morbidities included conditions such as major depressive disorder, panic disorder, substance abuse, generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, PTSD, and psychotic symptoms.

The 2019 study also revealed that psychiatric co-morbidity increased the risk of mortality among people with ADHD, especially when substance use disorder was involved. Therefore, the findings of the current study are significant in highlighting the potential benefits of ADHD medications in reducing the risk of psychiatric hospitalizations and suicidal behavior in individuals with ADHD.

It should be noted that while atomoxetine, an ADHD medication, was not associated with a lower risk of psychiatric hospitalizations or suicidal behavior, it was linked to fewer hospitalizations for non-psychiatric co-morbidities. This suggests that different ADHD medications may have varying effects on different aspects of health.

The researchers emphasized the importance of ADHD medications in improving functioning and quality of life in individuals with ADHD. However, they also acknowledged the need for further research on the long-term effectiveness and safety of these medications. While stimulants, such as those used to treat ADHD, have shown beneficial psychiatric outcomes, such as a decreased risk of depression and suicide, there are concerns about potential adverse effects, such as an increased risk of psychosis or cardiovascular diseases.

To conduct the study, the researchers analyzed data from the Swedish National Patient Register, as well as the Prescribed Drug Register, to track the healthcare and medication usage of individuals with ADHD. Methylphenidate was found to be the most commonly used ADHD medication, followed by lisdexamphetamine and atomoxetine.

The study participants were followed for a period of 15 years, during which 56% of them had a psychiatric co-morbidity. Anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and stress-related disorders were among the most common co-morbidities. Approximately 26% of the participants had been hospitalized due to a psychiatric co-morbidity.

Interestingly, the study found that lisdexamphetamine was associated with a decreased risk of psychiatric hospitalizations among adolescents, young adults, and adults aged 30 and older. However, methylphenidate appeared to be less effective among older adults. Atomoxetine, on the other hand, was linked to a decreased risk of hospitalization among women but not men.

Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the potential benefits of ADHD medications in reducing psychiatric hospitalizations and suicidal behavior in individuals with ADHD. However, further research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects and safety of these medications. It is important for healthcare professionals to carefully consider the risks and benefits when prescribing ADHD medications to individuals with ADHD.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/63c28dbb82c31b7412c92cf2/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 04:09:46,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/technology/article/what-are-rpg-games/,What Is A Role-Playing Game? RPG Types Explained,"Role-playing games (RPGs) have a unique appeal to different individuals, offering various experiences and opportunities. Some people enjoy the social aspect of sitting around a table, engaging in storytelling and rolling dice with friends. Others appreciate the character development, interactive storylines, and discussions that emerge from playing RPGs. Regardless of your background or experience level, this guide aims to introduce you to the most common types of RPGs, helping you find the perfect game to try for the first time or expand your horizons with a new experience.

What Are Role-Playing Games?
Role-playing games allow players to assume the role of a character within a game that also serves as a story. The decisions players make as they progress through the game influence their character's development and shape the overall narrative. Sometimes, the story is guided by a computer, while other times, it's controlled by another player.

The most prevalent structure of an RPG involves players embodying a single character. They have the freedom to customize their character's appearance, behavior, and abilities within the context of the story. These characters remain part of the narrative until one of three things occurs: they die, a game element removes them from the story, or the player decides to switch to a different character.

In this classic setup, one player assumes the role of the Game Master, Dungeon Master, Judge, Referee, Keeper, or some other title that signifies their central role in guiding the game. The Game Master is responsible for keeping the story on track, reacting to player actions, portraying supporting or antagonist characters, and resolving rule disputes. Game Mastering can be a challenging yet rewarding role for players who want to be at the heart of every game session.

Some RPGs offer a more collaborative structure, where everyone has equal control over the narrative. The game's rules determine who has control over the story at any given time. These types of games often aim to emulate a specific style of fiction or capture the essence of other forms of media, such as film or television.

Dungeons & Dragons, first published in 1974, is widely regarded as the earliest role-playing game. While there may have been other RPGs before it, Dungeons & Dragons captured the imagination of countless players and paved the way for hundreds of subsequent games, including many video game adaptations. RPGs on home computers and game consoles emerged in the 1980s, continually evolving and becoming more intricate with each passing year.

Even today, Dungeons & Dragons remains the most popular tabletop RPG on the market. Its influence has extended to the computer realm with the release of Baldur's Gate 3, garnering considerable attention. However, there is a vast array of RPGs to explore, each offering unique strengths that cater to their dedicated fan bases.

Types of RPGs
Categorizing RPGs can be challenging since many games blur the lines and incorporate different features and focuses. Nevertheless, here are some common styles of RPGs with examples to help you navigate the vast landscape.

1. MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game)
MMORPGs are played online by thousands, and sometimes millions, of people. Players log into a central server, create and improve their characters, and embark on missions. Some servers prioritize missions and character performance, while others encourage role-playing and maintaining character immersion.

World of Warcraft stands as the most popular MMORPG, with other notable examples including Guild Wars 2, EVE Online, Star Wars The Old Republic, and Black Desert Online.

2. ARPG (Action Role-Playing Game)
Action role-playing games emphasize combat as a significant component. Players must learn effective fighting techniques and equip their characters appropriately. While these games often focus on single-player battles, some also feature a multiplayer component.

The Diablo series serves as an exemplary ARPG, alongside titles like Elder Ring, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Borderlands.

3. CRPG (Computer or Console Role-Playing Game)
CRPG is a broad classification encompassing any RPG played on a computer or video game console. It typically involves a single-player, pre-scripted experience where players follow a specific storyline, with some room for exploration within dungeons or other enclosed areas.

Games developed by Bioware, such as Mass Effect and Dragon Age, epitomize this genre. Additionally, games like Planescape: Torment, Disco Elysium, and Shadowrun Returns fall into this category.

4. JRPG (Japanese Role-Playing Game)
JRPGs originated on game consoles and often combine elements of fantasy and science fiction. These games focus on party management and explore the dramatic relationships that underpin the save-the-world storyline.

While there are numerous JRPGs, notable examples include the Final Fantasy series, Persona series, and Dragon Quest series.

Conclusion
Role-playing games hold a diverse and captivating appeal for players worldwide. Whether you prefer the immersive experience of tabletop games like Dungeons & Dragons or the vast online worlds of MMORPGs like World of Warcraft, there is an RPG out there to suit your preferences. By exploring the various types of RPGs available, you can embark on exciting adventures, engage in rich storytelling, and immerse yourself in captivating narratives. So, grab your dice, assemble your party, and prepare for an unforgettable journey into the world of role-playing games.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fb562b1ede4feb9fc02f0c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1795,1010,x0,y92,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 12:00:00,Innovation,Innovation

Apple, on the other hand, claims that the DOJ's actions could ruin what its users enjoy about its phones and ecosystem. While the lawsuit draws a connection between Apple and Microsoft in the 1990s, there are some key differences between the two companies and their efforts to retain customers. However, experts predict that the lawsuit is unlikely to reach a resolution in the short-term and could take three to five years.

Moving on to other news, Microsoft made headlines by acquiring the co-founders of the high-profile AI startup, Inflection AI. Mustafa Suleyman will now lead Microsoft AI's consumer-facing unit, while Karén Simonyan takes on the role of EVP and CEO of the same group. This acquisition comes after Inflection raised $1.3 billion, with Microsoft being the biggest investor.

Nvidia's GTC event also grabbed attention this week. In addition to their usual focus on ray tracing, CEO Jensen Huang surprised attendees with a prediction that artificial general intelligence is just five years away. Moreover, Nvidia announced a new AI platform called GR00T, designed for humanoid robots.

Another piece of news making waves is the ongoing talks between Google and Apple. The two tech giants are reportedly discussing the deployment of Google's AI model to power upcoming iOS updates. It remains to be seen whether this partnership will be temporary or long-lasting.

In the realm of hacking and privacy, the Biden administration is forming an international coalition to combat commercial spyware. Interestingly, some investors joining the effort were previously involved in the very business they are now fighting against. Additionally, a recent hack disrupted a $5 million Apex Legends tournament, with the intention of highlighting the exploit to the game developers.

Glassdoor, the popular job review platform, faced criticism this week as users reported that their real names were being added to their profiles without consent. The only solution provided to them was to delete their accounts entirely.

Moving on to funding and IPOs, Reddit's IPO had a strong start, with the stock jumping 48% on its first day of trading. Astera Labs, a company specializing in connectivity hardware for cloud computing data centers, also experienced success, with its stock closing at $62.03 on its debut.

Lastly, The Browser Company, the startup behind the Arc browser, raised $50 million at a valuation of $550 million. The company's vision of supplanting PCs with browsers has generated both intrigue and controversy, but its path to monetization remains unclear.

In our bonus round, we explore why AI often struggles with spelling, despite its massive potential. We also discuss the challenges of reviewing AI systems like ChatGPT or Gemini, even though it's crucial to put them to the test.
