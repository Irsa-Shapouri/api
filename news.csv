https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/mallard-bay-airbnb-for-guided-hunting-and-fishing/,Mallard Bay is the Airbnb for guided hunting and fishing,"Americans spent more than $144.8 billion on fishing and hunting in 2022 alone, as per a survey by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. While guided hunting and fishing excursions have traditionally been offline, Mallard Bay, a Houston-based startup, aims to revolutionize this industry.

Mallard Bay serves as a marketplace for hunting and fishing enthusiasts to easily book guided tours online, similar to booking a hotel. Additionally, it offers outfitters a vertical SaaS platform to streamline their operations and provide additional services like marketing. The startup recently secured a $4.6 million Series A funding round led by Soul Venture Partners, with participation from Acadian Capital Ventures and other angel investors.

The idea for Mallard Bay stemmed from a disappointing hunting trip that co-founder and CEO Logan Meaux had experienced in college. Following a botched duck hunt in Oklahoma, where they found themselves double booked and unable to fully enjoy the experience, Meaux recognized the need for a more efficient booking system in the hunting and fishing industry.

Initially conceived as a marketplace similar to Airbnb, Mallard Bay evolved after consulting with outfitters and guides. Recognizing the need for a comprehensive solution, the team developed Guidetech, Mallard Bay's back office platform for outfitters. This shift in focus proved successful, with the platform facilitating over $6 million in gross bookings in 2023 and projected to reach $30-35 million in 2024.

Despite facing challenges in securing investor interest due to the niche nature of the hunting and fishing industry, Mallard Bay's growth and impact are undeniable. The company's commitment to ethical hunting practices and conservation efforts sets it apart in a market that is often misunderstood.

While hunting and fishing may not be mainstream topics in the tech ecosystem, Mallard Bay's success highlights the potential for innovation in niche markets. The recent funding rounds for hunting-related companies like HLRBO underscore the growing interest in outdoor activities.

As outdoor recreation continues to gain popularity, there is a clear need for streamlined platforms like Mallard Bay to enhance the booking experience for enthusiasts. By leveraging technology to connect consumers with guided tours and outfitters, Mallard Bay is paving the way for a more efficient and sustainable approach to hunting and fishing adventures.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/greysen-johnson-cZVzzFadTMc-unsplash.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-23 16:00:34,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2024/03/23/todays-wordle-1009-hints-clues-and-answer-for-sunday-march-24th/,"Today’s ‘Wordle’ 1009 Hints, Clues And Answer For Sunday, March 24th","Lazy Sunday is here, and with it comes the opportunity to solve today's Wordle. But before we dive into the puzzle, let's take a moment to appreciate the upcoming Easter festivities. Personally, I've always had a secret desire to make rabbit pot pies for Easter. The combination of the savory dish and the irony of using rabbit meat seems too delicious to resist. Maybe one day I'll give it a try.

But for now, let's focus on Wordle. And by the way, I've recently started writing Strands guides, which is a really fun new word puzzle game. If you're interested, you can check out today's guide on my blog.

So, how do we solve today's Wordle? Well, here's a hint: it's something that is useful when dry but useless when wet. And here's a clue: the phrase starts with a consonant. Intriguing, right?

Now, for the answer. Are you ready?

Today's Wordle phrase is... drumroll, please...

We'll get to that in a moment. But first, let's talk about Wordle analysis. Every day, I eagerly check Wordle Bot to see how I did. It's always interesting to compare results. In today's game, my initial guess was ""chain,"" which left me with a whopping 681 words. Thankfully, my next guess, ""slope,"" brought that number down to a much more manageable 19. Feeling confident, I went with ""below"" as my final guess. It wasn't a bad choice, considering it sounded like a good fit. And guess what? It worked! But was it just a coincidence? Hmmm...

Unfortunately, my competitive Wordle score was a total wash. I scored zero points for guessing in four attempts and zero for tying with the Bot. Zeroes all around! But hey, that's part of the fun, right?

Now, let's take a quick look at the etymology of the word ""towel."" Did you know that it traces its origins back to the Old French term ""touaille""? This word made its way into English usage around the 13th century. Fascinating, isn't it? The Old French word is believed to have been derived from the Medieval Latin term ""tovaglia,"" which in turn likely came from the Latin word ""tubicula,"" a diminutive form of ""tuba,"" meaning ""tube"" or ""cloth."" The evolution of the word reflects its use and importance in daily life, initially referring to a piece of cloth used for drying or wiping.

The transformation from ""touaille"" in Old French to ""towel"" in English showcases the linguistic influences of Norman French on the English language following the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. As time went on, the pronunciation and spelling of many French-origin words were Anglicized, leading to the modern English word ""towel"" that we use today. Towels have been a household staple for centuries, evolving in material and usage, but their fundamental purpose of drying or wiping remains unchanged.

And that's a wrap, folks! I hope you enjoyed today's Wordle adventure. Don't forget to check out my blog for daily Wordle guides and other exciting content, including TV show reviews, streaming guides, movie recommendations, video game coverage, and much more. Thanks for stopping by, and happy Wordling!","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6209dc2871dc07b5bc2b0ac7/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3846,2163,x0,y191,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-23 19:00:25,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/23/google-upgrade-samsung-s24-s23-pixel-towards-apple-iphone-15-pro-max/,Google Suddenly Reveals Surprise Android Update That Beats iPhone,"Android and iPhone have become more similar than ever, with Google taking the lead in introducing a groundbreaking feature that is set to arrive on Android before iPhone. In an effort to compete for users, Google has been working to make Android more like iPhone, and its latest update is a testament to that.

Previously, Google has focused on enhancing Android's security, integrating WhatsApp calls into its phone dialer, and even including Apple passes in its wallet. Now, with this new update, Google not only matches an existing iPhone feature, but goes beyond it, surpassing Apple in its own game.

One of the standout features of this update is the inclusion of an emergency satellite service, which brings Android on par with the satellite SOS functionality that Apple has had for a few years. However, Google takes it a step further by incorporating a ready-made Garmin rescue service into its plan. This is a significant advancement in terms of safety and security for Android users.

While Apple's emergency SOS feature is limited to emergencies only, Google's update aims to bridge that gap. The latest Android 15 developer preview indicates that users will now have the opportunity to expand their cellular accounts to include a satellite add-on, allowing core messaging apps to utilize the satellite network. This means no more connectivity black spots or dropped calls in areas with poor cellular coverage.

According to Mishaal Rahman, Android 15 DP2 introduces UI elements to ensure a consistent user experience for devices that support satellite connectivity. The update also expands platform support for satellite connectivity with the addition of a new API that apps can utilize to detect when a device is connected to a satellite. Furthermore, Android 15 enables SMS/MMS/RCS apps to use satellite connectivity for sending and receiving messages.

The ability for messaging apps to utilize satellite connectivity is a significant development. Some networks have plans to offer Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite connectivity as an account option. Initially, Google had updated Pixel phones with a ""Satellite SOS"" feature, which was placed between Car Crash Detection and Emergency SOS. However, it seems that Android's satellite connectivity will go beyond that, potentially with a satellite messaging option in partnership with T-Mobile.

Elon Musk's announcement that SpaceX had achieved download speeds of 17mbps to an unmodified Galaxy S21 Ultra further fueled speculation about the future possibilities of direct-to-phone satellite connectivity. This means that smartphones could make/receive calls and messages by connecting directly to a satellite, even in areas without conventional cellular network coverage. While this exciting prospect is still in the testing phase, messaging integration is a promising start.

It is now confirmed that Android 15 will include satellite messaging, unless there are major changes. As Android and iPhone continue to converge, this stands as an example of Google taking the lead, with Apple likely to follow suit. This news comes shortly after reports that Gemini, a Google technology, might be coming to iPhone, and Apple claiming that a lawsuit from the Department of Justice would essentially turn iPhone into Android. It has certainly been an eventful week in the world of smartphones.

In an update on March 23, it was revealed that Google's plans for satellite messaging coincided with the news that Gemini might be coming to Apple's iPhone to power some or many of iOS 18's AI updates. This development is intriguing on several fronts. Not only does it bring Android and iPhone closer together, but it also strengthens Google's position within the iPhone ecosystem.

The gap between Android and iPhone continues to narrow, and Gemini's deployment on handsets is further proof of Android's faster pace of innovation. While Apple users eagerly await more information about the next OS update in the fall, Android users can look forward to the exciting possibilities that satellite messaging will bring. The race between Android and iPhone is far from over, and it will be fascinating to see how each platform continues to evolve.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65d79ec3dadcd6b682668331/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-23 19:17:25,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2024/03/23/the-invisible-shield-aims-to-makes-public-health-more-visible/,‘The Invisible Shield’ Aims To Makes Public Health More Visible,"The importance of public health often goes unnoticed, much like the offensive line in football, which only gets attention when it makes mistakes. This analogy is aptly captured in the new TV series, The Invisible Shield, which sheds light on the vital role of public health in protecting communities from various health threats. Premiering on PBS on March 26 at 10 pm, this four-episode series aims to raise awareness about the crucial work of public health professionals.

The title, ""The Invisible Shield,"" symbolizes the behind-the-scenes efforts of the public health system to safeguard the population, often without receiving the recognition it deserves. As Kelly Henning, MD, Public Health Program Lead for Bloomberg Philanthropies, emphasizes, ""The better public health works, the less likely you are to see it."" Unfortunately, the public health system has been underfunded and underappreciated for years, leading to its gradual deterioration, unnoticed by many.

The Covid-19 pandemic has starkly exposed the vulnerabilities of the public health system, highlighting the urgent need for increased resources and support. Despite a temporary surge in public health awareness during the pandemic, sustained investments and attention are essential to prevent future crises. The series produced by RadicalMedia with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies aims to amplify the voice of public health amidst the noise of celebrity endorsements and commercial promotions.

Public health achievements, such as vaccinations, antibiotics, clean water supplies, and pollution control, have significantly impacted global health outcomes. Yet, these contributions often go unrecognized, overshadowed by other media narratives. The trailer for The Invisible Shield eloquently conveys the message that public health is silently saving lives every day, unbeknownst to most individuals.

As we embark on this journey of discovery, let us recognize and appreciate the invisible shield that protects us all.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff76b9cc324c33ed5484d7/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-23 21:25:08,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/23/explained-the-difference-between-a-solar-eclipse-and-a-lunar-eclipse/,Explained: The Difference Between A Solar Eclipse And A Lunar Eclipse,"Do you understand the distinction between a solar eclipse and a lunar eclipse? Two exciting celestial events are on the horizon—a lunar eclipse on Monday, March 25, and a solar eclipse on Monday, April 8. While these occurrences differ significantly, they share a common origin in celestial alignment.

A lunar eclipse occurs when Earth's shadow falls on the moon, whereas a solar eclipse arises when the moon obstructs the sun's light, casting a shadow on Earth. The rarity of both events stems from subtle differences in the orbital planes of Earth and the moon around the sun.

What Triggers a Lunar Eclipse
A lunar eclipse can only transpire during a full moon when Earth lies between the sun and the moon, projecting a shadow into space. Although full moons occur every 29 days, lunar eclipses are infrequent due to the moon's limited passage through Earth's shadow.

What Triggers a Solar Eclipse
Conversely, a solar eclipse can only occur during a new moon when the moon positions itself between the sun and Earth, casting a shadow on our planet. Despite the biweekly occurrence of new moons, solar eclipses are rare because the moon seldom blocks the sun's rays from Earth's perspective.

What Triggers a Total Lunar Eclipse
A total lunar eclipse necessitates a flawless alignment of the sun, Earth, and moon. Earth's shadows—the outer penumbral and inner umbral shadows—play a crucial role. When a full moon drifts into Earth's umbral shadow, it receives refracted sunlight, creating a mesmerizing pinkish-red glow known as the ""Blood Moon.""

On March 25, a penumbral lunar eclipse will grace the skies as the full ""Worm Moon"" traverses Earth's penumbra.

What Triggers a Total Solar Eclipse
A total solar eclipse occurs when the sun, moon, and Earth align perfectly, resulting in the moon's umbral shadow falling on Earth. This celestial phenomenon is a rare spectacle due to the moon's size relative to the sun and its proximity to Earth.

On April 8, North America will witness a total solar eclipse as the new ""Pink Moon"" obscures the sun and projects its umbral shadow.

The Rarity of Lunar and Solar Eclipses
Eclipses are sporadic events owing to the moon's 5-degree tilt relative to the sun's path. While the moon intersects the sun's path twice monthly, solar and lunar eclipses only occur during the new or full moon phases, leading to two eclipse seasons annually. However, most solar eclipses are partial or annular, and lunar eclipses are often penumbral or partial.

Upcoming Lunar and Solar Eclipses in 2024
In 2024, two eclipse seasons will unfold on March 25 and September 17:
- March 25, 2024: Penumbral lunar eclipse (visible in North America)
- April 8, 2024: Total solar eclipse (visible in North America)
- September 17, 2024: Partial lunar eclipse (visible in North America)
- October 2, 2024: Annular solar eclipse (visible in the Pacific Ocean and South America)

Upcoming Lunar and Solar Eclipses in 2025
In 2025, two eclipse seasons will commence on March 13 and September 7:
- March 13, 2025: Total lunar eclipse (visible in North America)
- March 29, 2025: Partial solar eclipse (visible in Canada and northern Europe)
- September 7, 2025: Total lunar eclipse (visible in Asia)
- September 21, 2025: Partial solar eclipse (visible in Antarctica)

If you believe you've witnessed a total solar eclipse, I hate to break it to you, but you're mistaken. This is a common misconception among many people who have experienced a partial solar eclipse and mistakenly think it was a total one. However, the truth is that witnessing a total solar eclipse is an unforgettable event that leaves a lasting impression.

To truly understand the difference, it's important to know that a total solar eclipse occurs when the moon completely blocks the sun, resulting in a momentary darkness and a breathtaking view of the sun's corona. This phenomenon is extremely rare and can only be observed from specific locations along the path of totality.

One recent total solar eclipse that captured the attention of millions was the ""Great American Eclipse"" in 2017. This event brought totality to 12 U.S. states, from Oregon to South Carolina. Approximately 12 million people lived within the path of totality, and an additional million traveled to witness this awe-inspiring spectacle. If you were fortunate enough to be in the path of totality, you would remember the mesmerizing twilight-like sky, the moon's silhouette, and the ethereal beauty of the sun's corona shining all around it. Such an experience becomes a cherished memory for a lifetime.

To determine whether you've witnessed a total solar eclipse or a partial one, you can ask yourself a few questions. If your memory involves the use of solar eclipse glasses or pinhole cameras, chances are it's from the 2017 partial solar eclipse that was visible across North America. To be certain, you can consult the Solar Eclipses Visibility Database, which provides information on solar eclipses based on location.

If you're still unsure, here's a list of total solar eclipses that have occurred in North America in the last 70 years. Each link leads to an interactive map that shows the path of totality. If your memory doesn't align with any of these dates, it's likely that you witnessed a partial solar eclipse.

Now, imagine meeting someone who believes they've seen a total solar eclipse but actually hasn't. Engage them in conversation, inquire about the date, location, and their recollection of totality. Then, gently inform them about the upcoming total solar eclipse on April 8, 2024—a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for them to finally experience the true wonder of totality.

On that day, a narrow 115-mile path will traverse parts of Mexico, 15 U.S. states, and Canada. Within this path, individuals will have the chance to witness the complete blocking of the sun by the moon. It will journey through five states in Mexico, including Sinaloa, Nayarit, Durango, Coahuila, and Chihuahua, as well as 15 U.S. states, such as Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. Additionally, six Canadian provinces—Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland—will also be within the path of totality.

While everyone in North America will witness a partial solar eclipse on April 8, only those within the narrow path of totality will have the privilege of experiencing the awe-inspiring totality.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2024/03/24/epa-didnt-ban-gas-cars-it-cut-air-pollution-so-we-can-breathe-easier/,EPA Didn’t Ban Gas Cars. It Cut Air Pollution So We Can Breathe Easier.,"On days when the air quality index hits unhealthy levels, the taste of air pollution lingers in your mouth and nose, leaving a sharp sting in your lungs. This experience is all too familiar to many, especially for those who fall into vulnerable categories like the elderly, children, pregnant women, and individuals with respiratory conditions. But what exactly is the primary culprit behind this toxic air that we breathe?

The answer lies in the exhaust emitted from internal combustion engines that run on gasoline or diesel. These engines are responsible for spewing harmful pollutants into the atmosphere, contributing significantly to the pollution levels in our environment. In fact, a staggering two-thirds of Americans heavily rely on personal vehicles for their daily commute, making transportation the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. Of this sector, light-duty vehicles alone account for nearly 60% of the climate pollution generated.

To combat this pervasive issue of air pollution, it is imperative to address the root cause by reducing tailpipe emissions from vehicles. Fortunately, we have a powerful tool at our disposal to achieve this goal: tailpipe emissions standards. Recently, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency took a historic step by implementing new multi-pollutant regulations for light-duty and smaller medium-duty vehicles. These updated standards mandate automakers to incorporate the latest clean technologies into their vehicles, ensuring that new cars are cleaner and more environmentally friendly than ever before.

The adoption of these stringent pollution limits marks a significant milestone in the fight against air pollution, benefiting not just a select few but the entire population. It is crucial to recognize the detrimental effects of air pollution, which impacts 36% of the U.S. population, or nearly 120 million individuals. People living in areas with high levels of air pollution are at risk of developing respiratory diseases like asthma, emphysema, and chronic bronchitis, with children being particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects.

While these standards represent a positive step towards cleaner air and a healthier environment, some entities view them as a threat to their interests. Corporations that profit from selling vehicles and petroleum products perceive these regulations as a hindrance to their business operations. They argue that the standards infringe upon consumer choice and American freedoms, creating a false narrative that aims to discredit the EPA's efforts.

In response to the EPA's emission standards, profit-driven corporate polluters have launched disinformation campaigns to sway public opinion against the regulations. Their misleading tactics seek to portray the standards as a ban on gas cars, instilling fear and confusion among the masses. However, it is crucial to understand that the EPA's standards are rooted in scientific research and aim to protect public health and welfare by reducing harmful emissions.

The Clean Air Act, enacted in 1970, empowers the EPA to establish air quality standards and regulate emissions from vehicles and engines. Over the years, the EPA has continued to refine these standards, driving technological advancements in engine efficiency and emission control. The introduction of catalytic converters and the shift to unleaded fuel are testament to the significant strides made in reducing air pollution.

Before the implementation of the Clean Air Act, cities like New York and Los Angeles grappled with severe air pollution, posing serious health risks to their residents. The air quality was so poor that breathing in these cities was likened to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day. However, with the introduction of stringent air quality standards and emission regulations, significant improvements have been observed in reducing pollution levels and safeguarding public health.

The journey towards cleaner air and a sustainable environment is an ongoing process that requires collective efforts from all stakeholders. By embracing cleaner technologies and supporting stringent emission standards, we can pave the way for a greener, healthier future for generations to come. It is imperative to recognize the importance of protecting our environment and mitigating the impacts of air pollution for the well-being of all individuals.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fe401fc35aefb76700b52e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 07:45:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/anuradhavaranasi/2024/03/24/which-adhd-medications-could-lower-risk-of-suicide--hospitalization/,Which ADHD Medications Could Lower Risk Of Suicide & Hospitalization?,"Illustration of the ADHD process, attention deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity. The cerebral areas located in the frontal lobe, responsible for attention, organizational skills, and emotional responses, are abnormally active or have a specific anatomy. There is also an imbalance in levels of some chemical messengers in the brain, such as dopamine and noradrenaline.

A recent study involving 221,714 individuals with ADHD revealed that those prescribed ADHD stimulant medications had a lower risk of attempting suicide or dying by suicide. Additionally, the use of ADHD medications was associated with fewer psychiatric hospitalizations. Heidi Taipale and colleagues from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, found that specific ADHD medications like amphetamine, lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate were linked to a decreased risk of psychiatric co-morbidities.

While lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate were associated with a decreased risk of suicidal behavior, atomoxetine did not show a lower risk of psychiatric hospitalizations or suicidal behavior. However, atomoxetine was linked to fewer hospitalizations for non-psychiatric co-morbidities.

A 2019 study in Sweden reported that individuals with ADHD had a higher prevalence of psychiatric co-morbidities compared to those without ADHD. These co-morbidities include major depressive disorder, panic disorder, substance abuse, generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, PTSD, and psychotic symptoms. Psychiatric co-morbidity increased the risk of mortality, especially when accompanied by substance use disorder.

The study participants, aged 16 to 65 years old, residing in Sweden and diagnosed with ADHD between 2006 to 2021, were analyzed using healthcare data from the Swedish National Patient Register. Methylphenidate was the most commonly used ADHD medication, followed by lisdexamphetamine and atomoxetine. The follow-up period lasted 15 years, with 56% of participants having a psychiatric co-morbidity. Anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and stress-related disorders were common, with nearly 26% hospitalized due to psychiatric co-morbidities.

Interestingly, lisdexamphetamine was effective in reducing psychiatric hospitalizations across different age groups, while methylphenidate showed less effectiveness in older adults. Atomoxetine was linked to a decreased risk of hospitalization in women but not men.
