In their project, reported in the journal Nature Materials, the group studied the behavior over time of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) tape used to make lithium-ion batteries in smartphones.Personal device makers and owners alike know that there is one feature of such devices both would like to improve—battery performance and lifespan. Lithium-ion batteries in devices such as smartphones only last a few years. They also self-discharge, losing charge even when they are not being used. In this new effort, the research team wondered about the impact of using PET tape in batteries.To find out, they studied characteristics of the tape over long periods of time in smartphones. They found that the tape was not chemically stable—it tended to depolymerize, which led to reductions in performance. This had a negative impact on both battery longevity and self-discharge. The team then looked for a suitable replacement and found that polypropylene (PP) tape worked just as well as PET tape in lithium-ion batteries and does not depolymerize.The researchers found that using PP tape instead of PET tape made lithium-ion batteries last approximately 10% longer. They also found that using PP tape reduced self-discharge by approximately 70%. In the real world, that would mean phones would lose little of their charge when inactive for long periods of time.The research team also noted that switching from PET to PP tape likely would not change the cost of devices using lithium-ion batteries. They acknowledge, however, that further testing is required to make sure PP tape works as well at PET tape and that it holds up to use in other ways before it could be used in new devices.More information: Anu Adamson et al, Improving lithium-ion cells by replacing polyethylene terephthalate jellyroll tape, Nature Materials (2023).

Their project is reported in the journal Science Robotics.An exosuit is a type of device that can be worn over the body. Engineers and roboticists have been creating exosuits over the past several years for multiple applications. Some types have been developed, for example, to help those with disabilities to walk. Others assist troops in carrying heavier loads. Others help people jog a little faster or to run longer distances. In this new effort, the research team built an exosuit expressly designed to improve running speed.The exosuit built by the team in Korea is small with minimal parts. It consists of a backpack containing a power pack, which provides pressure on cables that extend from the pack to the hips and down each thigh. It weighs just 4.4 kilograms. The cables improve running speed by assisting with each stride—as a step is taken, the attached cable constricts, pulling the trailing leg forward faster than it would normally. The researchers also incorporated sensors and a computer to process information regarding gait—this allows for automatically synchronizing with steps as the person runs.The team tested their exosuit by asking amateur volunteer",https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/800a/2023/exosuit-helps-runners.jpg
https://techxplore.com/news/2023-09-3d-coffee-grounds-caffeinated-creations.html,3D printing with coffee: Turning used grounds into caffeinated creations,"29TwitShareEmailSEPTEMBER 11, 2023by Daniel Strain, Nicholas Goda, University of Colorado at BoulderCoffee can do a lot of things: Wake you up, warm you up and lessen that existential dread. According to a new study, it could also help reduce the waste from 3D printing.That's the vision behind a new project led by Michael Rivera, an assistant professor in the ATLAS Institute and Department of Computer Science at the CU Boulder. He and his colleagues have developed a method for 3D printing a wide range of objects using a paste made entirely out of old coffee grounds, water and a few other sustainable ingredients.The team has already experimented with using coffee grounds to craft jewelry, pots for plants and even, fittingly, espresso cups. The technique is also simple enough that it will work, with some modifications, on most low-cost, consumer-grade 3D printers.""You can make a lot of things with coffee grounds,"" Rivera said. ""And when you don't want it anymore, you can throw it back into a coffee grinder and use the grounds to print again.""The group presented its findings at the Association for Computing Machinery's Designing Interactive Systems conference in Pittsburgh.For Rivera, the project is part of his mission to make 3D printing more sustainable—allowing artists, designers, engineers and more to quickly make graspable prototypes and other household objects without adding to landfills.""Our vision is that you could just pick up a few things at a supermarket and online and get going,"" Rivera said.That vision predictably began in a coffee shop.When Rivera was a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University, he often worked out of a café in Pittsburgh called Arriviste Coffee Roasters. The coffee shop contracted with a local group to pick up its used coffee grounds for composting, but during the COVID-19 pandemic, that wasn't possible. The waste began to pile up.""The owner told me, 'I don't know what to do with it. So I just throw it away,'"" said Rivera, who joined CU Boulder as a postdoctoral researcher in 2022. ""I looked at the grounds and said, 'Maybe I can do something with them.'""Rivera explained that most consumer 3D printers on the market today print with thermoplastics of some kind. The most common is polylactic acid, or PLA. This material is, theoretically, compostable, but only a fraction of composting facilities will accept it.""If you throw it in a landfill, which is where the majority of PLA ends up, it will take up to 1,000 years to decompose,"" Rivera said.He realized he could solve several problems at the same time: Reduce plastic waste, find something to do with all those used grounds and enjoy some warm cups of coffee in the process.The team's method is pretty simple, Rivera noted. He and his colleagues mix dried coffee grounds with two other powders that they buy online: cellulose gum and xanthan gum. Both are common additives in food and degrade easily in a compost bin. Next, the researchers mix in water.""You're pretty much shooting for the consistency of peanut butter,"" Rivera said.You can't load that ooze directly into a 3D printer. First, Rivera does a little jury-rigging, modifying a printer with plastic tubes and a syringe filled with coffee paste. But the group's creations are surprisingly hardy. When dried, the coffee grounds material is about as tough as unreinforced concrete.""We've made objects with a ton of usage,"" Rivera said. ""We've dropped them, and they haven't broken yet.""He sees a lot of potential for turning coffee grounds into tangible objects. Rivera, for example, has made small planters out of coffee grounds, which can be used to grow seedlings for acid-loving plants like tomatoes. Once the plants get tall enough, you can plant them, pot and all, in the soil. The team can also add activated charcoal to its grounds to make parts that can conduct electricity, such as buttons for sustainable electronics.Rivera noted that printing with coffee grounds may never become a widespread practice. Instead, he sees the project as a step toward discovering other kinds of sustainable 3D printing materials that could, one day, replace plastics.More information: Michael L.

https://techxplore.com/news/2023-09-adhesive-stretchable-epicardial-patch-precisely.html,An adhesive and stretchable epicardial patch to precisely monitor the heart's activity,"17TwitShareEmailSEPTEMBER 28, 2023 FEATUREby Ingrid Fadelli , Tech XploreEpicardial patches are carefully engineered tissue patches that can be placed near or on a patient's heart. These devices can help doctors to diagnose and treat a variety of heart conditions, including arrhythmia and heart attacks (i.e., myocardial infarctions).In recent years, several engineers and medical researchers have been trying to develop these devices, yet many solutions proposed so far are not ideal. Specifically, most epicardial patches created so far are designed to be affixed onto the heart via a medical procedure known as ""suturing,"" which can be both challenging and risky.Researchers at Sungkyunkwan University, the Institute for Basic Science and other institutes in South Korea recently developed an alternative epicardial patch that could be much easier to apply in clinical settings. This patch, introduced in Nature Electronics, is both stretchable and adhesive; thus, it does not need to be affixed onto a patient's heart through the suturing process.""The fixation of conventional epicardial patches to the heart tissue is a time-consuming task and involves a complex surgical process,"" Prof. Donghee Son, one of the researchers who carried out the study, told Tech Xplore. ""Furthermore, over prolonged periods of use, the durability of the flexible polymers composing the epicardial patch tends to degrade, leading to an undesired gap between the patch and cardiac tissue, ultimately making precise diagnosis and treatment difficult.""To overcome the limitations of existing epicardial patches, lately some research teams have been experimenting with alternative designs based on soft biomaterials, such as glue or hydrogels. Despite some progress in this area, a reliable design has not yet been identified and commercialized.""Considering the highly irregular surface of the heart, the existing devices with low adhesiveness often become detached due to continuous cardiac contraction/relaxation in long term,"" Son said. ""To overcome such issues, facile and instantaneous and even robust adhesion to cardiac tissues is essential. Furthermore, when attached to the heart for an extended period, the materials used in epicardial devices should be exceptionally soft to avoid causing any tissue compression.""Son and his colleagues set out to develop a new adhesive epicardial patch that effectively overcomes the limitations of previously proposed designs. The patch they created can be instantly attached to tissue on the heart's surface and could easily be fabricated on a large-scale.Notably, their patch does not exert any unnecessary pressure on the heart's tissue for extended periods of time, which could improve both its safety and efficacy. It is comprised of three different but co-existing materials, namely a liquid-phase conducting composite, a network-shaped substrate, and an ionic adhesive.The combination of these materials eliminates the need to suture the patch to the heart, making it easy to implement for medical professionals with varying degrees of experience, while also reducing the risk of complications associated with the suturing procedure.""We designed the electronic patch with three layers consisting of soft, adhesive jelly-like materials known as hydrogels with ionic conductivity, stretchable electrodes made from liquid-phase metals, and fibrous-structured self-healing elastomeric materials, which are the key components of our innovation,"" Son explained.""Among them, the sticky hydrogels are inspired by the wet-resistant adhesion mechanism of marine mussels. The hydrogels play a crucial role by enabling immediate attachment of the entire electronic patch to the heart without the need for sutures.""The adhesiveness of the team's patch is further enhanced by its fibrous-structured substrate, which is designed to dissipate the mechanical stress spontaneously produced while the heart is beating. In contrast with other epicardial patches introduced in the past, the new device includes electrodes based on a liquid-phase metal, as opposed to solid-phase metals such as copper and silver.""These liquid metal electrodes exhibit remarkable reliability and stability when monitoring epicardial signals, even under repeated heartbeats,"" Son said. ""We conducted experiments to record heart signals from awake and running animals for four weeks, marking a significant breakthrough.""In addition to being safer and easier to apply to the heart's tissue, the epicardial patch developed by Son and his colleagues can collect highly precise measurements, thus it can reliably diagnose heart attacks and arrhythmia, two of the most common cardiovascular diseases worldwide.In addition, the patch can intervene on abnormal signals, modulating the heart's rhythm and facilitating its normal functioning. As it is not as invasive as other patches introduced in the past, the team's solution does not cause tissue damage or inflammation, reducing the risk of undesirable complications.""Our intrinsically stretchable epicardial patch has electrical bidirectional functionalities that provide precise diagnosis and feedback therapy on cardiovascular diseases,"" Son said.""The patch can be instantaneously attached to heart tissues, leading to excellent prognosis. Our materials/devices strategy not only captures these diverse signals with precision but also has the capacity to locally stimulate tissues for therapeutic purposes, effectively functioning as an 'electroceutical' device. This dual functionality opens exciting possibilities for personalized medicine, where the patch can be tailored to an individual's unique physiological needs.""In initial tests, the epicardial patch developed by Son and his colleagues achieved highly promising results, highlighting its potential for advancing the diagnosis and treatment of heart conditions. The new solution could also have important implications for the field of precision medicine, allowing doctors to offer more personalized treatments tailored around the unique needs of individual patients.""Our patch holds the potential to revolutionize the way we approach medical treatments, by combining the capabilities of signal recording and tissue stimulation,"" Son added.""We are currently in the process of developing an advanced bioelectronic patch with an expanded array of channels, surpassing the current limitation of four channels, this enhanced capability will enable us to monitor a wider range of electrophysiological signals, including those originating from electroactive tissues, peripheral nerves, skeletal muscles, and even the brain.""More information: Heewon Choi et al, Adhesive bioelectronics for sutureless epicardial interfacing, Nature Electronics (2023).

https://techxplore.com/news/2023-09-wearable-sensor-analysis.html,"New wearable sensor makes continuous analysis of sweat possible, researchers say","72TwitShareEmailSEPTEMBER 28, 2023by Andrew Krebs, Pennsylvania State UniversityContinuous monitoring of sweat can reveal valuable information about human health, such as the body's glucose levels. However, wearable sensors previously developed for this purpose have been lacking, unable to withstand the rigors or achieve the specificity needed for continuous monitoring, according to Penn State researchers. Now, the research team has created a novel wearable patch that may be up to the task.Made with a laser-modified graphene nanocomposite material, the device can detect specific glucose levels in sweat for three weeks while simultaneously monitoring body temperature and pH levels, the researchers reported in Advanced Functional Materials.""Sweat is ideal for real-time, continuous and noninvasive biomarker detection,"" said principal investigator Huanyu ""Larry"" Cheng, the James L. Henderson, Jr. Memorial Associate Professor of Engineering Science and Mechanics (ESM) at Penn State.""But low biomarker concentration levels in sweat and variability of other factors such as pH, salinity and temperature have pushed previous sweat biosensors past the limits of their detection and accuracy. This device is able to account for this variability while measuring glucose with needed specificity for weeks at a time.""Cheng and his colleagues recognized from their previous sensor studies and work conducted by other researchers that laser-induced graphene (LIG) electrodes—electrodes fabricated with a nanomaterial constructed in a single step with laser scribing—could offer a promising starting point to develop a more effective wearable sweat sensor.Despite limitations due to low sensitivity to glucose and a limited surface area for the necessary electrochemistry, Cheng said, LIG electrodes are simple to fabricate, affordable and flexible.Working at the nanoscale, the researchers reported using a simple laser treatment to create a stable, 3D network of highly conductive noble metal alloys—gold and silver in this case—and carbon-based nanocomposite materials on the porous LIG electrode. Noble metals are not only highly conductive but are also resistant to oxidation, Cheng said.By heating the gold and silver alloy nanocomposite material with a simple laser treatment, Cheng said the material also resists agglomeration. This is a common phenomenon where nanoparticles coalesce into clusters, limiting the material's surface area.""Glucose on the surface of the modified LIG electrode oxidizes at lower potential,"" said first author Farnaz Lorestani, ESM postdoctoral scholar. ""This oxidation generates a measurable current or potential change that is directly proportional to the overall glucose concentration in the solution. We also see far greater stability over time, with the laser-treated sensor losing only 9% of its sensitivity over three weeks compared to 20% sensitivity loss for a sensor without laser treatment.""In addition to measuring glucose, the modified LIG electrode responded to changes in pH levels, too, according to the researchers. To fabricate the wearable device, they combined the dual glucose and pH sensor with another LIG-based temperature sensor and a stretchable layer with coil-shaped microfluidic channels to continuously collect and route sweat for sampling.The device allows for the calibration of glucose measurements based on fluctuations in sweat pH and body temperature from activities such as exercise and eating, Cheng said. Worn as a patch roughly twice the width of a postage stamp and affixed to the skin with adhesive tape, it can wirelessly communicate its collected data to a computer or mobile device for real-time monitoring and analysis.""The result of our work is a sensor with the notable sensitivity and stability to monitor glucose levels over multiple weeks,"" Cheng said. ""It is a low-cost platform offering convenient, accurate and continual analysis of sweat in diverse conditions, which has great potential for individual and population health, personalized medicine and precision nutrition.""More information: Farnaz Lorestani et al, A Highly Sensitive and Long‐Term Stable Wearable Patch for Continuous Analysis of Biomarkers in Sweat, Advanced Functional Materials (2023).

https://techxplore.com/news/2023-09-3d-insights.html,3D insights into an innovative manufacturing process,"43TwitShareEmailSEPTEMBER 19, 2023by Barbara Vonarburg, Paul Scherrer Institute3D printing can produce highly complex shapes. But printing ceramic objects with the help of a laser is a more difficult challenge. Now researchers at the Paul Scherrer Institute PSI have for the first time taken tomograms revealing what happens at microscopic level during this fabrication process. The findings will help improve this very promising technology.3D printing is already being used to produce many objects. Additive manufacturing is increasingly being used in the aerospace and automotive industry, for example, as well as in medicine.The method commonly used for metals and plastics is known as laser-based powder bed fusion (LPBF). In LPBF, the material is applied as a fine powder layer on a substrate and then the laser passes over the powder and melts it to form it into the desired shape. The next thin layer of powder is deposited and once again melted by the laser. The component is built up sequentially in this way, layer by layer.Exactly what happens during the LPBF process has already been investigated using X-rays at the Swiss Light Source SLS at PSI and fellow research institutes, but these microscopic insights have only provided 2D images to date.""We wanted to go one step further and track the manufacturing process in 3D,"" says Malgorzata Makowska, material scientist at PSI. Instead of 2D X-ray images, the researchers wanted to obtain 3D tomograms with a speed allowing them to follow the laser spot. To do so, they had to rotate their sample during the manufacturing process and track this rapid rotary movement with the laser—a major challenge. For the first time, the team has now managed to do this, as reported in the journal Communications Materials.The scientists used aluminum oxide for their experiments. This ceramic material is typically used, for example, in the chemical industry for components exposed to high temperatures, in electrical engineering as an insulator, or in medicine for implants. Because this material is extremely hard and brittle, however, fabricating complex shapes with conventional technology presents huge challenges.""It would be much easier if one could print such components,"" says PSI physicist Steven Van Petegem. ""When printing aluminum oxide, however, it's still difficult to obtain a sufficiently dense material and the desired microstructure.""The experiments conducted at the SLS tomography beamline TOMCAT offered new insights into the innovative manufacturing process. The test sample rotated at a speed of 50 Hz (3000 rpm), while the laser traveled over the powder. Adapting the printing process to this extremely rapid rotation was one of the main difficulties, which the researchers have now overcome.Another challenge was to prevent the rotating material drifting apart as a result of centrifugal forces. They achieved it by adding a tiny amount of magnetic iron oxide into the aluminum oxide powder particles and then incorporating a magnet to keep the powder in place. The magnet was mounted beneath the sample in a small cylinder with a 3 mm diameter.""Thanks to the fast GigaFRoST camera, an in-house PSI development, and a highly efficient microscope, it was possible to acquire 100 3D images each second during the printing process,"" explains beamline scientist Federica Marone. These images showed what happened to the powder during the laser treatment.""For the first time we were able to directly visualize the melted volume in 3D,"" says Makowska. The shape of the so-called 'melt pool' surprised the researchers. When they increased the power of the laser, no depression formed on the surface, as expected. ""Instead the melt pool spread out like a pancake and the surface was more or less flat,"" the material scientist comments.The researchers could also observe how pores and hollows formed as the material hardened, which is important for future applications. ""Ideally one would like to have a smooth, attractive material with a well-defined microstructure. But a certain amount of porosity is also very desirable for specific applications,"" explains Makowska.Van Petegem adds, ""We hope our experiments will reveal more about the printing process and that we can pass on this knowledge, so that it can be put to practical use, even if there is still a long way to go."" The upgrade of the SLS machine starting soon and the new TOMCAT 2.0 beamlines coming into operation in 2025 will enhance the current capabilities. ""It will become possible to study denser material with higher spatial and temporal resolution, key aspects for bringing the LPBF technology further,"" says beamline scientist Christian Schlepütz.The study was made with the collaboration of the technology competence center Inspire AG, ETH Zurich and Empa. The idea for this research was a follow-up of the Fuorclam project launched in 2017 within the frame of a Strategic Focus Area (SFA) Advanced Manufacturing program.""The various projects have given us the opportunity to get to know all the groups in Switzerland engaged in research into additive manufacturing and 3D printing,"" says Van Petegem. ""This is an extremely important topic for the future, which Switzerland has acknowledged.""More information: Malgorzata G.

These devices could contribute to the ongoing shift towards sustainable energy solutions by aiding the global production of green hydrogen and electrical power.PCECs have numerous advantages over conventional low-temperature electrochemical cells with polymer-based electrolytes. For instance, they can attain higher energy efficiencies and are compatible with different types of fuels.Despite their good performance and advantageous characteristics, these cells have so far proved difficult to produce and implement on a large-scale. The key reason for this is that their operating temperature is extremely high, typically over 500 °C.Researchers at Kansas State University, Colorado School of Mines, Nissan Technical Center North America (NTCNA), Nissan Motor Company and University of Oklahoma recently introduced a new design strategy that brings down the operating temperatures of PCECs to below 450°C. Their proposed approach, introduced in Nature Energy, could help to overcome the hurdles currently limiting the widespread use of these promising energy solutions.""Lowering the PCEC operating temperature can facilitate its scale-up and commercialization,"" Fan Liu, Hao Deng and their colleagues wrote in their paper. ""However, achieving high energy efficiency and long-term durability at low operating temperatures is a long-standing challenge. We report a simple and scalable approach for fabricating ultrathin, chemically homogeneous, and robust proton-conducting electrolytes and demonstrate an in situ formed composite positive electrode, Ba0.62Sr0.38CoO3−δ–Pr1.44Ba0.11Sr0.45Co1.32Fe0.68O6−δ.""The composite positive electrode created by the researchers can significantly reduce different types of resistance in PCECs, including ohmic resistance and resistance linked to positive electrode-electrolyte contact and electrode polarization. In conjunction with optimal electrolytes, this electrode could help to significantly improve the performance of PCECs at temperatures below 450°C.To explore the potential of their proposed design strategies, Liu, Deng and their colleagues used them to create new PCECs. They then ran a series of tests to assess these devices' power densities and operating temperatures, both while they were serving as fuel cells and as steam electrolyzers.""The PCECs attain high power densities in fuel-cell mode (~0.75 W cm−2 at 450 °C and ~0.10 W cm−2 at 275 °C) and exceptional current densities in steam electrolysis mode (−1.28 A cm−2 at 1.4 V and 450 °C). At 600 °C, the PCECs achieve a power density of ~2 W cm−2,"" Liu, Deng and their colleagues wrote in their paper.""Additionally, we demonstrate the direct utilization of methane and ammonia for power generation at <450 °C. Our PCECs are also stable for power generation and hydrogen production at 400 °C.""The results of the team's initial evaluations are highly promising, suggesting that their proposed methods could enable the fabrication of highly performing PCECs that can both serve as fuel cells and support hydrogen production, all while operating at lower temperatures. Remarkably, the electrolyte created by the researchers was also found to enable resistances comparable to or even lower than those observed in previously developed PCECs that rely on sophisticated fabrication processes.The approaches introduced in this recent paper could soon inform the development of additional PCECs that can operate at low temperatures, ultimately facilitating the large-scale deployment of this emerging energy solution. In the future, the team's prototype cells could also be improved and perfected to further reduce their operating temperatures and boost their performance.More information: Fan Liu et al, Lowering the operating temperature of protonic ceramic electrochemical cells to <450 °C, Nature Energy (2023).

It boasts a 95% efficiency rate, with virtually no waste.Energid, Universal Robots systems can pick citrus fruits such as oranges and grapefruits with a robotic system deploying multiple cameras and flexible arms.The River LettuceBot scans crop geometry and ensures optimal growth and minimal pesticide usage by distinguishing between weeds and product as it thins overly crowded vegetable crops. This prevents oversaturation and disease.PrecisionHawk aids all types of robotic farm operations with drone-based remote sensing and analytics.Scientists are continuing to test new approaches to bring greater efficiency to agricultural tasks.At the Universities of Edinburgh in Scotland and Sheffield in England, researchers are tackling the problem of visual navigation through dense vegetation, a challenge for robotic structures engaging in tasks on uneven and unmarked terrain.In doing so, they relied on a tiny model for inspiration: Formica rufa, better known as the ant.Ants may be tiny, but they tackle big tasks. They solve complex organizational issues and have a systematic division of labor. And they've done pretty well in the evolution department: They've been around 100 million years. Entomologists estimate there are up to 20 quadrillion living among us today. That means their mass would be roughly equivalent to the mass of all humans alive today.In an article, ""Neuromorphic sequence learning with an event camera on routes through vegetation,"" published in the in the journal Science Robotics, the professors said they sought ""low-power, efficient onboard solutions"" for their research into robotic navigation.""We took inspiration from insects, such as ants, that are capable of learning and following routes in complex natural environments using relatively constrained sensory and neural systems,"" said researcher Le Zhu.""Insect brains in particular provide a powerful combination of efficiency and effectiveness,"" Zhu said. ""Here, we provide an exemplar of such an approach, implementing a network for visual route memory on neuromorphic hardware that drew directly on recent insights from insect neuroscience.""They designed an artificial neural network that essentially assists robots by steering them through challenging, vegetation-dense environments.""Even 'simple' animals such as ants can excel at navigation under natural outdoor conditions… that still challenge current robots,"" Zhu said. ""One problem in such environments is to recognize previously visited places or traversed routes as the basis for a navigation system.""They built a robot that collects images along unfamiliar routes and developed an algorithm based on circuitry found in the brains of insects.They relied on previous research on insect memory and ""mushroom bodies,"" structural components of insect brains that analyze sensory information—especially odors—and integrate it with navigation and tasks such as finding food and avoiding enemies.The researchers tested their neural model along challenging routes on uneven, muddy, vegetation-dense fields and achieved positive results. They said their research shows promise for future applications in agriculture, forestry and environmental monitoring.""We used a bioinspired event camera on a terrestrial robot to collect visual sequences along routes in natural outdoor environments and applied a neural algorithm for spatiotemporal memory that is closely based on a known neural circuit in the insect brain,"" Zhu said.

https://techxplore.com/news/2023-09-brain-broadband-electro-quasistatic-fields-enable.html,The brain gets its own broadband: Electro-quasistatic fields enable broadband communication for brain implants,"196TwitShareEmailSEPTEMBER 25, 2023 FEATUREby Ingrid Fadelli , Tech XploreIn recent years, engineers have been working to develop increasingly sophisticated devices that can help humans to interact better with computers. These technologies, including brain-machine interfaces, electroceuticals and wearable health care devices, could potentially advance both existing medical practices and the capabilities of human users.A research team at Purdue University recently introduced a new approach to enable communication between the human brain and computers via wireless neural implants. Their proposed approach, outlined in Nature Electronics, relies on a two-phase process that slowly unfolds in the brain, allows a small sensor implanted in the brain to sense and transfer information to a wearable headphone-shaped device, without disrupting the human body's physiological processes.""Our group at Purdue University has been working in the area of electric field communication around the human body for the past eight years and pioneering technologies such as EQS-HBC, which is now being commercialized,"" Shreyas Sen, the principal investigator for the study, told Tech Xplore.""Through this exercise, we learnt that similar to the communication of body-generated ECG signals through the body, we can send digital information through the tissue using various technologies, some of which we have patented.""The human body, including the brain, is innately able to support internal communications based on the generation of tiny electrical signals, the high-speed nature of which establishes a 'broadband' channel spanning across the body. So-called brain-computer interfaces are designed to enable high bandwidth interactions between these brain signals and computers.""Once our electric-field based communication technology was mature around the body, it became an obvious choice for us to conduct this investigation, as it is also applicable inside the brain, for high bandwidth ultra-low power implant-to-computer communication,"" Sen explained.The technology developed by Sen and his colleagues is based on the idea of low-power and high-bandwidth data communication between various implanted wireless devices distributed around the brain. These distributed implants could record and stimulate various brain regions, both within the cortex (i.e., the brain's outer layer) and in the deep brain.""This technology, when combined with further advancements in deep-brain wireless power transfer, would make it possible to gain fundamental insights into disorders like Parkinson's disease, Tourette Syndrome, Epilepsy, Depression, Anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder,"" said Baibhab Chatterjee, who led this work as a doctoral student at Purdue and is now a faculty at the University of Florida in Gainesville.""The low-power yet high-bandwidth data communication is made possible by using the biological tissue as a medium for signal transfer, which we have explored extensively at Purdue, for both wearables and implants, and have shown that the tissue provides a wideband channel at electro-quasistatic (EQS) frequencies (up to 10s of MHz) using capacitive termination.""This recent study partly builds on one of the team's earlier works, where they introduced a technique known as EQS-HBC, which stands for electro-quasistatic human body communication. In this previous paper, the team showed that signals can be transferred between different wearable devices by coupling the so-called capacitive return-path with the Earth's ground.""The primary difference that makes this a unique challenge for implants is the fact that the conductive tissue completely surrounds the implant, which makes the capacitive return-path coupling to the Earth's ground almost non-existent,"" Chatterjee said.To overcome this challenge, the researchers previously leveraged a technique known as galvanic coupling, which is based on the theory of electrical dipole coupling. While this method was partly effective, they found that the low-impedance channel between the signal and reference electrodes of a galvanic implant resulted in an excessive amount of power consumption, if the signals are not DC-balanced.""In this work, we demonstrate a technique called biphasic quasistatic brain communication (BP-QBC), which can reduce that power consumption by orders of magnitude (~41X reduction at 1 MHz), enabling the creation of an ultra-low-power yet broadband communication channel,"" Chatterjee said.""Furthermore, owing to a fully EQS signaling, our methods do not incur any transduction loss as compared to competing technologies such as ultrasound, optical and magneto-electric data transfer, thereby reducing the system-level losses, which is another unique advantage of this technology.""The recent work by this team of researchers essentially builds on their previous work on EQS field-based communication around the body and introduces it to the brain, to enable communication between wireless neural implants and wearable computers. This technique would be implemented via ultra-low power wireless microdevices that can transfer data at a high rate, which are located in different parts of the brain, forming a unified network.""With this invention, the human brain 'gets its own broadband,'"" Sen explained. ""Most notably, we found that electric field-based communication in the brain provides an extremely high bandwidth and moderate loss channel for high-speed communication between implants and wearables directly. The bandwidths achievable are significantly higher than existing optical, magnetic, ultrasound, or radio frequency-based technologies.""According to the researchers, they have merely outlined the fundamental functioning and underlying components of their proposed system so far. Further theoretical studies and in-vivo measurements could help to validate its potential, while also assessing its compatibility with existing neural implants.""In our next works, we will explore multiple additional modalities based on the proposed fundamentals,"" Sen said. ""We will also conduct translational research, to implement the proposed ideas as commercializable devices and hence intercept the development of future brain computer interface devices.""In the future, the new approach introduced by this team of researchers could be tested and implemented in clinical settings. If proved to be safe, reliable and effective, it could greatly advance medical research, for instance improving the present understanding of various neurological and behavioral disorders.Sen, Chatterjee and their colleagues are now working on a new version of their proposed system that also supports multi-channel sensing. In addition, they are trying to develop new system-level approaches that could reduce the power consumption of neural implants, allowing them to transfer more data while consuming similar amounts of energy.""Another area that we are actively working on is improving the power-transfer efficiency and reduce leakage in such implants,"" Chatterjee added. ""At the same time, we are looking into various translatable applications of this technique for central as well as peripheral nervous systems, as part of our work in the Center for Internet of Bodies, where the goal is to establish seamless connectivity between multiple implants and wearables.""More information: Baibhab Chatterjee et al, Biphasic quasistatic brain communication for energy-efficient wireless neural implants, Nature Electronics (2023).

https://techxplore.com/news/2023-09-ai-driven-tool-easy-personalize-3d-printable.html,AI-driven tool makes it easy to personalize 3D-printable models,"59TwitShareEmailSEPTEMBER 14, 2023by Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyAs 3D printers have become cheaper and more widely accessible, novice makers within a rapidly growing community are fabricating their own objects. To do this, many of these amateur artisans access free, open-source repositories of user-generated 3D models that they download and fabricate on their 3D printers.But adding custom design elements to these models poses a steep challenge for many makers, since it requires the use of complex and expensive computer-aided design (CAD) software, and is especially difficult if the original representation of the model is not available online. Plus, even if a user is able to add personalized elements to an object, ensuring those customizations don't hurt the object's functionality requires an additional level of domain expertise that many novice makers lack.To help makers overcome these challenges, MIT researchers have developed a generative-AI-driven tool that enables the user to add custom design elements to 3D models without compromising the functionality of the fabricated objects. A designer could utilize this tool, called Style2Fab, to personalize 3D models of objects using only natural language prompts to describe their desired design. The user could then fabricate the objects with a 3D printer.""For someone with less experience, the essential problem they faced has been: Now that they have downloaded a model, as soon as they want to make any changes to it, they are at a loss and don't know what to do. Style2Fab would make it very easy to stylize and print a 3D model, but also experiment and learn while doing it,"" says Faraz Faruqi, a computer science graduate student and lead author of a paper introducing Style2Fab.Style2Fab is driven by deep-learning algorithms that automatically partition the model into aesthetic and functional segments, streamlining the design process.In addition to empowering novice designers and making 3D printing more accessible, Style2Fab could also be utilized in the emerging area of medical making. Research has shown that considering both the aesthetic and functional features of an assistive device increases the likelihood a patient will use it, but clinicians and patients may not have the expertise to personalize 3D-printable models.With Style2Fab, a user could customize the appearance of a thumb splint so it blends in with her clothing without altering the functionality of the medical device, for instance. Providing a user-friendly tool for the growing area of DIY assistive technology was a major motivation for this work, adds Faruqi.He wrote the paper with his advisor, co-senior author Stefanie Mueller, an associate professor in the MIT departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering, and a member of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) who leads the HCI Engineering Group; co-senior author Megan Hofmann, assistant professor at the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University; as well as other members and former members of the group. The research will be presented at the ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology.Online repositories such as Thingiverse allow individuals to upload user-created, open-source digital design files of objects that others can download and fabricate with a 3D printer.Faruqi and his collaborators began this project by studying the objects available in these huge repositories to better understand the functionalities that exist within various 3D models. This would give them a better idea of how to use AI to segment models into functional and aesthetic components, he says.""We quickly saw that the purpose of a 3D model is very context-dependent, like a vase that could be sitting flat on a table or hung from the ceiling with string. So it can't just be an AI that decides which part of the object is functional. We need a human in the loop,"" he says.Drawing on that assessment, they defined two functionalities: external functionality, which involves parts of the model that interact with the outside world, and internal functionality, which involves parts of the model that need to mesh together after fabrication.A stylization tool would need to preserve the geometry of externally and internally functional segments while enabling customization of nonfunctional, aesthetic segments.But to do this, Style2Fab has to figure out which parts of a 3D model are functional. Using machine learning, the system analyzes the model's topology to track the frequency of changes in geometry, such as curves or angles where two planes connect. Based on this, it divides the model into a certain number of segments.Then, Style2Fab compares those segments to a dataset the researchers created which contains 294 models of 3D objects, with the segments of each model annotated with functional or aesthetic labels. If a segment closely matches one of those pieces, it is marked functional.""But it is a really hard problem to classify segments just based on geometry, due to the huge variations in models that have been shared. So these segments are an initial set of recommendations that are shown to the user, who can very easily change the classification of any segment to aesthetic or functional,"" he explains.Once the user accepts the segmentation, they enter a natural language prompt describing their desired design elements, such as ""a rough, multicolor Chinoiserie planter"" or a phone case ""in the style of Moroccan art."" An AI system, known as Text2Mesh, then tries to figure out what a 3D model would look like that meets the user's criteria.It manipulates the aesthetic segments of the model in Style2Fab, adding texture and color or adjusting shape, to make it look as similar as possible. But the functional segments are off-limits.The researchers wrapped all these elements into the back end of a user interface that automatically segments and then stylizes a model based on a few clicks and inputs from the user.They conducted a study with makers who had a wide variety of experience levels with 3D modeling, and found that Style2Fab was useful in different ways based on a maker's expertise. Novice users were able to understand and use the interface to stylize designs, but it also provided a fertile ground for experimentation with a low barrier to entry.For experienced users, Style2Fab helped quicken their workflows. Also, using some of its advanced options gave them more fine-grained control over stylizations.Moving forward, Faruqi and his collaborators want to extend Style2Fab so the system offers fine-grained control over physical properties as well as geometry. For instance, altering the shape of an object may change how much force it can bear, which could cause it to fail when fabricated. In addition, they want to enhance Style2Fab so a user could generate their own custom 3D models from scratch within the system. The researchers are also collaborating with Google on a follow-up project.More information: Faraz Faruqi et al, Style2Fab: Functionality-Aware Segmentation for Fabricating Personalized 3D Models with Generative Ai (2023).This story is republished courtesy of MIT News (web.mit.edu/newsoffice/), a popular site that covers news about MIT research, innovation and teaching.Explore furtherFacebookTwitterEmailFeedback to editorsSEP 29, 20231SEP 28, 20230SEP 28, 20230SEP 28, 20230SEP 27, 20230SEP 30, 2023SEP 30, 2023SEP 29, 2023SEP 29, 2023SEP 29, 2023SEP 29, 2023",https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/800a/2023/ai-driven-tool-makes-i.jpg

A team led by Bo Wu and Shaojie Liu at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in China designed and tested a kind of Mach-Zehnder interferometer mesh that is more efficient at performing real-valued matrix-vector multiplication.Their research was published Sep. 19 in Intelligent Computing.Conventional Mach-Zehnder interferometer mesh has many advantages, including large bandwidth and high stability. However, it was designed for complex-valued matrix-vector multiplication, a type of computation that has hardware requirements different from those of real-valued matrix-vector multiplication. The new mesh is customized to take advantage of differences between the two types of computation.The new mesh is more efficient because real-valued matrices have half as many degrees of freedom as complex-valued matrices, and thus require half as many phase shifters. Fewer phase shifters means a smaller piece of hardware that requires less electricity to operate. Moreover, the simplified mesh is easier to use and easier to fabricate because of the way it detects light.The conventional mesh requires ""coherent"" light, such as light from a laser, whose waves are all the same size, shape, and direction. The simplified mesh detects ""incoherent"" light, a kind of light whose waves are much less regular and can be produced by a wider variety of light sources.According to the researchers, ""The results show that the proposed MZI mesh exhibits excellent performance in the benchmark task. Additionally, the error analysis indicates that the proposed scheme is robust to fabrication errors."" Moreover, the simplified mesh is scalable, which means it holds great potential for use in large-scale optical neural networks, where the savings would be similarly large.""We first designed the architecture with our intuition and common sense because there is a clear redundancy of phase shifters,"" said corresponding author Hailong Zhou of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.The mesh was developed in several steps, beginning with a ""type 0"" conventional mesh for a complex-valued optical matrix, progressing to a ""type 1"" mesh with fewer phase shifters, then to a ""type 2"" mesh with an additional output port, then to a ""type 3"" mesh with a smaller footprint. The effectiveness of the type 3 mesh is supported by mathematical proofs and numerical simulation.

https://techxplore.com/news/2023-09-full-wafers-high-performing-2d-semiconductor.html,Growing full wafers of high-performing 2D semiconductor that integrates with state-of-the-art chips,"99TwitShareEmailSEPTEMBER 19, 2023by Devorah Fischler, University of PennsylvaniaThe semiconductor industry today is working to respond to a threefold mandate: increasing computing power, decreasing chip sizes and managing power in densely packed circuits.To meet these demands, the industry must look beyond silicon to produce devices appropriate for the growing role of computing.While unlikely to abandon the workhorse material anytime in the near or distant future, the technology sector will require creative enhancements in chip materials and architectures to produce devices appropriate for the growing role of computing.One of the biggest shortcomings of silicon is that it can only be made so thin because its material properties are fundamentally limited to three dimensions [3D]. For this reason, two-dimensional [2D] semiconductors—so thin as to have almost no height—have become an object of interest to scientists, engineers and microelectronics manufacturers.Thinner chip components would provide greater control and precision over the flow of electricity in a device, while lowering the amount of energy required to power it. A 2D semiconductor would also contribute to keeping the surface area of a chip to a minimum, lying in a thin film atop a supporting silicon device.But until recently, attempts to create such a material have been unsuccessful.Certain 2D semiconductors have performed well on their own, but required such high temperatures to deposit they destroyed the underlying silicon chip. Others could be deposited at silicon-compatible temperatures, but their electronic properties—energy usage, speed, precision—were lacking. Some fit the bill for temperature and performance but could not be grown to the requisite purity at industry-standard sizes.Now, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Science have grown a high-performing 2D semiconductor to a full-size, industrial-scale wafer. In addition, the semiconductor material, indium selenide (InSe), can be deposited at temperatures low enough to integrate with a silicon chip.Deep Jariwala, Associate Professor and Peter and Susanne Armstrong Distinguished Scholar in the Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering (ESE), and Seunguk Song, postdoctoral fellow in ESE, led the study, published recently in Matter.""Semiconductor manufacturing is an industrial-scale manufacturing process,"" says Jariwala. ""You aren't going to have a viable material unless you can produce it on industrial-scale wafers. The more chips you can make in a batch, the lower the price. But the material must also be pure to ensure performance. This is why silicon is so prevalent—you can make it in large quantities without sacrificing purity.""InSe has long shown promise as a 2D material for advanced computing chips because it carries electrical charge exceptionally well. But producing large enough films of InSe has proven tricky because the chemistry of indium and selenium tends to combine in a few different molecular proportions, taking on chemical structures with varying ratios of each element and thus compromising its purity.The team's success hinged on Song's application of a growth technique that overcame the quirks of InSe's atomic structure.""For the purposes of an advanced computing technology, the chemical structure of 2D InSe needs to be exactly 50:50 between the two elements. The resulting material needs a uniform chemical structure over a large area to work,"" says Song.The team achieved this groundbreaking purity using a growth technique called ""vertical metal-organic chemical vapor deposition"" (MOCVD). Previous research had attempted to introduce the indium and selenium in equal quantities and at the same time. Song demonstrated, however, that this method was the source of undesirable chemical structures in the material, producing molecules with varying ratios of each element. MOCVD, by contrast, works by sending the indium in a continuous stream while introducing the selenium in pulses.""By pulsing, you give the indium and selenium time to combine. In the moments between pulses, you deprive the environment of selenium, which prevents the ratio from getting too high. The benefit of the pulse is the pause. That's how we get a uniform 50:50 ratio across our entire full-size wafer,"" says Song.In addition to chemical purity, the team was also able to control and align the direction of crystals in the material, enhancing the quality of their semiconductor even further by providing a seamless environment for electron transport.""The two most important material qualities in a semiconductor are chemical purity and crystalline order. The most important industrial quality is scalability. This material checks every box,"" says Jariwala.More information: Seunguk Song et al, Wafer-scale growth of two-dimensional, phase-pure InSe, Matter (2023).

Their method uses the Geometrical Theory of Diffraction and the corresponding Keller cones to trace edges of the objects. The technique has also enabled—for the first time—imaging (reading) the English alphabet through walls with WiFi, a task once deemed too difficult for WiFi due to the complex details of the letters.""Imaging still scenery with WiFi is considerably challenging due to the lack of motion,"" said Mostofi, a professor of electrical and computer engineering. ""We have then taken a completely different approach to tackle this challenging problem by focusing on tracing the edges of the objects instead."" The proposed methodology and experimental results appeared in the Proceedings of the 2023 IEEE National Conference on Radar (RadarConf) on June 21, 2023.This innovation builds on previous work in the Mostofi Lab, which since 2009 has pioneered sensing with everyday radio frequency signals such as WiFi for several different applications, including crowd analytics, person identification, smart health and smart spaces.""When a given wave is incident on an edge point, a cone of outgoing rays emerges according to the Keller's Geometrical Theory of Diffraction (GTD), referred to as a Keller cone,"" Mostofi explained. The researchers note that this interaction is not limited to visibly sharp edges but applies to a broader set of surfaces with a small enough curvature.""Depending on the edge orientation, the cone then leaves different footprints (i.e., conic sections) on a given receiver grid. We then develop a mathematical framework that uses these conic footprints as signatures to infer the orientation of the edges, thus creating an edge map of the scene,"" Mostofi continued.",https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/800a/2023/wifi-can-read-through.jpg

Now, we know that view is backward.The buildup of mossy or tree-like structured lithium metal deposits on battery electrodes is not the root cause of performance loss, but rather a side effect. The first direct measurement of the electrical properties at the boundary between the solid electrode and the liquid electrolyte inside a rechargeable battery is reported in Nature Energy.The study, led by a research team at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, shows that the so-called solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is not an electronic insulator, as previously thought, but instead behaves like a semiconductor. The research solves the long-standing mystery of how SEI functions electrically during battery operation.The findings have direct implications for designing longer-lasting batteries by tuning the physical and electrochemical properties of the liquid electrolyte, which is often referred to as the blood supply of an operating battery.""A higher rate of electrical conductance induces a thicker SEI with intricate solid lithium forms, ultimately leading to inferior battery performance,"" said Chongmin Wang, a PNNL Laboratory Fellow and battery technology expert who co-led the study.Researchers focus on this SEI layer, which is thinner than a sheet of tissue paper, because of its out-sized role in battery performance. This filmy mosaic selectively permits charged lithium ions to cross during discharge and controls movement of electrons that supply the battery's power.When batteries are new, the SEI forms on the first charging cycle and ideally remains stable during the battery's expected lifespan. But a look inside an aging rechargeable battery often reveals substantial buildup of solid lithium on the negative electrodes. Battery researchers have assumed that this buildup causes the performance losses. Part of the reason for this guess work has been an inability to make measurements to test cause and effect.Wang, along with co-lead of the study Wu Xu, a materials scientist of PNNL's Battery Materials and Systems Group, co-first authors Yaobin Xu and Hao Jia, and their colleagues at PNNL, Texas A&M University, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory solved this problem by developing a new technique to directly measure electrical conduction across the SEI in an experimental system.The team combined transmission electron microscopy with nanoscale manipulation of microfabricated metal needles inside the microscope. The researchers then measured the electrical properties of the SEI layer formed on either a copper or lithium metal with four different types of electrolytes.The group's measurements revealed that as voltage increases in the battery, the SEI layer in all cases leaks electrons, making it semi-conductive.Once they had recorded this semiconductor-like behavior, which had never been directly observed previously, they wanted to understand which components of the chemically complex SEI are responsible for the electron leakage.""We found that the carbon-containing organic components of the SEI layer are prone to leaking electrons,"" Xu said.The researchers concluded that minimizing the organic components in SEI would enable the batteries to have longer useful life.""Even slight variations of the rate of conduction through the SEI can result in dramatic differences in efficiency and battery cycling stability,"" Wang added.PNNL researchers Peiyuan Gao, Xia Cao, Phung M. L. Le, Mark H. Engelhard, Shuang Li and Ji-Guang Zhang also contributed to the research.More information: Direct in situ measurements of electrical properties of solid–electrolyte interphase on lithium metal anodes, Nature Energy (2023).

https://techxplore.com/news/2023-09-dark-patterns-japanese-mobile-apps.html,Researchers find 'dark patterns' in Japanese mobile apps,"17TwitShareEmailSEPTEMBER 29, 2023by Tokyo Institute of TechnologyPopular Japanese mobile apps have malicious design elements called dark patterns or deceptive user interface designs, researchers from Tokyo Tech have found. A new class of dark patterns, called ""Linguistic Dead-Ends,"" of types ""Untranslation"" and ""Alphabet Soup,"" was also discovered.The researchers found an average of 3.9 deceitful design elements per app and uncovered how language and culture influence the presence and impact of these manipulative practices in digital design in Japan and across the globe.Dark patterns (DPs) refer to malicious and deceitful design elements in user interfaces used for apps and websites that lead end users to take actions contrary to their original intentions or expectations, often benefiting creators and stakeholders. While extensively studied in Western contexts, this key issue in critical computing remains unexplored in the booming app market in Japan, where cultural and linguistic nuances in design ethics may influence the utilization and expression of DPs.In this regard, a group of researchers from Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech), led by Associate Professor Katie Seaborn from the Department of Industrial Engineering and Economics, recently analyzed 200 popular mobile apps in the Japanese Google App store. Their work was published in Proceedings of the 2023 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems.The researchers found that a significant majority of these apps contained DPs, with an average of around 3.9 deceptive design elements per app. They classified these patterns into six classes. While five of these classes were drawn from an established taxonomy of DPs by De Geronimo et al. (2020), one was newly discovered in this work: a novel class of DP termed ""Linguistic Dead-Ends."" It comprises two distinct subclasses: ""Untranslation"" and ""Alphabet Soup"".Dr. Seaborn explains, ""Linguistic Dead-Ends refer to language and symbol use that prevents a user from understanding crucial functionality in an app, even while the rest of the app is in perfect Japanese. For instance, key information may be presented in another language while the rest of the app is in the local language, or characters from the local syllabary are used to construct words that seem legitimate but do not make sense on closer inspection.""This research underscores the pressing need for cross-cultural investigations into DPs, recognizing that user perceptions and responses to these design elements may significantly differ across regions. Furthermore, it highlights the significance of considering language and cultural differences when evaluating and researching a topic like DPs.The choice of language and the cultural context can inadvertently hide the existence of a subset of DPs, like Linguistic Dead-ends, or foster the emergence of new DPs that escape global recognition.""DPs may be more prevalent in the Western app market, which has an average of 7.4 DPs per app, according to the work of Di Geronimo et al. (2020), compared to the Japanese app market, which has an estimated average of 3.9 DPs per app, at least in the offerings of one major app store. This discrepancy suggests that cultural awareness may play a pivotal role in shaping how DPs are employed across the globe,"" adds Dr. Seaborn.In summary, this work uncovers the presence and implications of DPs in Japanese mobile apps, paving the way for more user-centered and culturally-sensitive design practices in the ever-evolving landscape of app development.More information: Shun Hidaka et al, Linguistic Dead-Ends and Alphabet Soup: Finding Dark Patterns in Japanese Apps, Proceedings of the 2023 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (2023).

https://techxplore.com/news/2023-09-reliable-wearable-finger-movements-real-time.html,A reliable and wearable system to recognize finger movements in real-time,"94TwitShareEmailSEPTEMBER 13, 2023 FEATUREby Ingrid Fadelli , Tech XploreDevices that can detect, track and decode movements in their surroundings can have countless valuable applications in fields ranging from robotics to health care, the entertainment industry, sports, and more. Wearable sensors can be particularly effective in detecting and recording the movements of human users, as they can be strategically placed and may pick up subtler movements with greater precision.Researchers at Ajou University, Korea University and the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KU-KIST) recently developed a new system that can recognize the movements of a human user's fingers in real-time. Their proposed device, presented in Nature Electronics, is based on a wearable sensor and an array of so-called artificial synapses (i.e., hardware components that replicate the function of synapses in the brain).""The evolution of human-machine interfaces is moving toward a more seamless integration with our daily lives,"" Prof. Sungjun Park (Ajou University), one of the researchers who carried out the study, told Tech Xplore. ""Ideally, we'd interact with technology without even being consciously aware of it. One pivotal way of achieving this is through enabling machines to recognize natural human movements, especially intricate actions like finger motions. Such recognition is not just a novelty but holds profound implications for areas like robotics, health care, and communication.""Despite recent advancements in the development of wearable motion recognition systems, many of the solutions proposed so far still do not achieve optimal results. Most recently developed systems for recognizing human movements rely on two or more stationary devices, such as 3D depth cameras, infrared cameras, and inertial measurement units.""The types of setups inadvertently hamper the very natural movements they seek to recognize,"" Prof. Gunuk Wang (KU-KIST) explained. ""Furthermore, their underlying algorithms are resource-intensive, both in terms of time and energy, mainly because they need to differentiate fingers from other objects and then track their movements over successive time frames. Our recent paper in Nature Electronics sought to overcome these barriers.""Building on their previous research efforts, Prof. Park, Wang and their colleagues set out to develop an ""unrestricted"" motion recognition system that could reliably detect and recognize the movements of a user's individual fingers. To do this, they integrated widely used optical sensors with artificial synapses onto a very thin substrate, which had a thickness of approximately 2 micrometers (i.e., about 1/20th of a human hair's diameter).""The genesis of this idea came from two pivotal works,"" Prof. Park said. ""The first is my previous work on highly sensitive and ultra-flexible organic photovoltaics for self-powered ECG sensors, while the second is Gunuk Wang's development of synaptic devices with robust, stable operation over extended periods.""The researchers' finger motion recognition system has two primary components, namely an optical sensor (organic proximity sensors) and a so-called synaptic device. By carefully placing these two components onto a highly thin substrate, the team was able to produce a device that is easy to wear on top of the skin, while also adapting to the creases that naturally form on the skin while humans are moving.This unique design allows users to move as freely as they want in their surroundings, while the system records and recognizes their movements. The system achieves finger motion recognition by completing three different steps: motion capturing, signal conversion and learning/recognition.""While wearing the sensor, users can draw patterns in the air (for our demonstrations we used numbers 0 through 9),"" Prof. Park explained. ""This is captured by the optical sensor placed on the index finger's top and side. To provide lighting conditions, we positioned two different lights in vertical alignment. For illustration, if you drew the number '3,' your finger would trace a unique route along both horizontal (x-axis) and vertical (y-axis) planes. As the optical sensor gets closer or farther from the light, it generates varying voltage patterns.""As a second step, the team's system translates the light captured it by the motion sensor into an electrical signal in real-time. The resulting unique voltage patterns, derived from the movements of fingers, are then transformed into digital images representing the magnitude of the voltage. Finally, these digital images are fed to the synaptic device, which proceeds to predict a user's finger motions by running a machine learning algorithm.""This component is key for learning and recognizing patterns,"" Prof. Wang said. ""It adjusts and updates synaptic weights (w) based on input, with its ability to change and maintain conductance playing a crucial role. In essence, a more pronounced input voltage leads to a more significant change in conductance, which is held for a specific duration. Over time, the device is trained to recognize patterns for numbers 0 through 9, making it capable of identifying new, random patterns based on the synaptic weights it has learned.""In contrast with many other motion recognition systems introduced in the past, the researchers' system is more reliable, durable and accurate in its predictions. Remarkably, their device can tolerate strains of up to 60% and can retain its functioning after it is repeatedly bent more than 1,200 times.The system also works in poor lighting conditions, including in environments with scarce illumination or at times of the day when there is little light. In initial evaluations, it achieved a remarkable accuracy rate of up to 95%, thus predicting the finger movements of human users far better than countless other solutions introduced in the past.""We've made significant strides in the intersection of neuromorphic computing and wearables,"" Prof. Park said. ""By synergizing a sensor and synaptic device onto an extraordinarily pliable substrate, we've crafted a system that not only melds seamlessly with the user but also showcases outstanding computational prowess. This is characterized by reduced power demands, heightened accuracy, and commendable resilience—both mechanically and electrically.""In the future, the new finger detection system introduced by this team of researchers could be implemented and tested in various settings that can benefit from the reliable monitoring of human movements. Its underlying design could also inspire further efforts in the field, leading to the development of new state-of-the-art motion tracking and recognition technologies.""Beyond just finger motion, this technology can be adapted for recognizing other bodily movements,"" Prof. Park said. ""Furthermore, its implications are far-reaching, spanning diverse sectors, including robotics, where it could facilitate precise human-machine interactions; health care, where it could revolutionize patient monitoring and rehabilitation; communications, where it could enable more intuitive interfaces; wearable technology, where it could aid development of more user-friendly and adaptable devices; and the realms of augmented and virtual reality, where it could help to create more immersive and naturalistic experiences.""In their current and upcoming studies, Prof. Park and his colleagues plan to continue working on their device to further advance its capabilities and performance. In addition, they would like to use their design to create new technologies that can be used to interpret other body movements and physiological signals.""Our recent work centered on the creation of a skin-conformable system specifically tailored for real-time finger motion recognition, achieved by merging an optical sensor and an artificial synapse on an exceptionally pliable substrate,"" Prof. Park added.""The potential of this platform doesn't end here. In fact, we're exploring the integration of diverse sensor types, such as strain or thermal sensors, to interpret an even broader range of data. The versatility of the optical sensor also piques our interest; its potential to gauge other vital metrics, like blood oxygen levels or heartbeats, is intriguing. Essentially, this underlines our system's expansive adaptability across numerous applications.""More information: Haein Cho et al, Real-time finger motion recognition using skin-conformable electronics, Nature Electronics (2023).

The paper titled ""Engineering DNA Materials for Sustainable Data Storage Using a DNA Movable-Type System"" introduces a novel approach that utilizes DNA fragments, referred to as ""DNA movable types,"" for data writing, thereby eliminating the need for costly and environmentally hazardous DNA synthesis.DNA molecules have long been recognized as green materials with immense potential for high-density and long-term data storage. However, the traditional process of DNA data storage via DNA synthesis has been plagued by high costs and the production of hazards, limiting its practical applications. In response to these challenges, the researchers developed a DNA movable-type storage system inspired by ancient movable-type printing.The key innovation of this system lies in the use of pre-generated DNA fragments, produced by cell factories, as the basic writing units. These DNA movable types are assembled in a repetitive manner to encode digital information, bypassing the need for de novo DNA synthesis. The process of data writing is achieved by the rapid assembly of these DNA movable types, ensuring a reliable and cost-effective approach to data storage.The researchers successfully encoded 24 bytes of digital information in DNA using this system and accurately read it back through high-throughput sequencing and decoding. This proof-of-concept demonstration showcases the feasibility and potential of the DNA movable-type storage system.One of the major advantages of this system is its potential for cost reduction. By utilizing pre-synthesized DNA fragments, the need for expensive DNA synthesis is eliminated. Moreover, the assembly-based data-writing process is entirely biological, making it an environmentally friendly and sustainable technique. The researchers also highlight that this process can be easily parallelized, further increasing its efficiency and scalability.The DNA movable-type storage system presents a promising route towards economical, sustainable, and environmentally friendly data storage solutions. With the ongoing advancement of high-throughput automation solutions, the researchers expect the data write bandwidth of this system to be substantially improved, meeting the future demands of large data storage.The potential applications of this innovative system are far-reaching. From archival data storage to cloud computing, this technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we store and access information. By harnessing the power of DNA, researchers are paving the way for a more sustainable and efficient digital data-storage technology.This research opens up new possibilities for the future of data storage and has significant implications for various industries. With its potential for cost reduction, scalability, and sustainability, the DNA movable-type storage system represents a major step forward in the field of data storage.More information: Zi-Yi Gong et al, Engineering DNA Materials for Sustainable Data Storage Using a DNA Movable-Type System, Engineering (2023).

https://techxplore.com/news/2023-09-intention-person-brain.html,Discovering the intention of a person using just brain wave data,"9TwitShareEmailSEPTEMBER 20, 2023by DGISTA research team led by Professor Sanghyun Park from the Department of Robotics and Mechanical Engineering at DGIST announced that they have developed a few-shot learning model capable of accurately classifying brain waves using a small amount of information.A large amount of brain wave data collected from target subjects is needed for classifying new brain waves using existing deep-learning models; however, the newly developed deep-learning model is capable of accurately classifying brain waves even with a small amount of data, which may contribute to future research related to brain waves.Brain wave data vary significantly by person. The distribution of brain waves differs by performer even when the same task is performed; thus, most existing classification models collect data from performers and label them to be used for training, focusing only on intra-subject classification. Therefore, the brain waves of a person who did not participate in the training could not be classified using those classification models.To overcome this drawback, research has been actively conducted on ""domain adaptation"" models in which deep-learning models are used to infer the brain wave signals of a target subject; however, the problem remains where the models cannot be easily applied to new subjects because they need to learn the brain wave data of those subjects as well.Furthermore, other studies are being conducted on the optimization of transfer learning models where brain wave data collected from multiple individuals are trained, but their usability is rather low since a large amount of brain wave data is still required.The research team led by Professor Park thus developed a new deep-learning model capable of accurately classifying brain waves according to the brain wave characteristics of each subject when the ground truth of a small amount of data is given from the brain wave data obtained from target subjects.For effectively learning the relation between a small amount of data and the remaining brain waves, meaningful features are first extracted from the brain wave data by using the embedding module, and then the temporal attention module is used to highlight important features from the extracted features while reducing unnecessary noise.Subsequently, the aggregation attention module is used to find only important data from the given brain wave data to identify the features of the target subject's intention as represented in the brain waves. Lastly, the relation module is used to calculate the relation between brain wave features and vectors. Also, brain wave classification fine-tuning technology was developed to ensure that brain waves are accurately classified through optimization.The deep-learning model newly developed by the research team exhibited up to 76% classification accuracy for the intention of a target subject using 20 brain wave data points in inter-subject classification. Considering that the accuracy of previously proposed methods (intra-subject classification, transfer learning, and other few-shot learning methods) is 64–73%, the newly developed model demonstrated superior performance.Professor Park said, ""The brain wave classification deep-learning model developed in this study is capable of accurately classifying brain wave with only a small amount of information, without having to newly build learning data from subjects, and therefore, it is expected to contribute to other related research on brain waves requiring individualization."" He further added, ""Our technology will be further enhanced to be more universally utilized in various biosignal analyses.""This research was supported by the ""Intelligent big data integrated platform development project for customized health management services of police officers"" of the Korean National Police Agency and the ""Commercialization project of immersive human robot multi-sensory exchange technology"" of DGIST.

In their study, reported in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the group treated sample luffa sponges and measured the electricity they generated when repeatedly squeezed.Prior research has shown that applying force or stress to certain materials can result in an accumulation of a piezoelectric charge. Prior research has also shown that repeatedly applying and releasing the force or stress can result in the production of a flow of piezoelectricity.Over the past several years, engineers have investigated the possibility of generating small amounts of piezoelectricity by taking advantage of footsteps, for example, or the movement of clothes as a person walks. Electricity generated and collected in such ways is seen as a possible way to charge personal devices. In this new effort, the research team looked into use of a new kind of material to generate piezoelectricity—luffa sponges.Luffa sponges are porous shells that are left behind when the fruit of a luffa plant is left to dry. They have been prepared and sold as a commercial product, mainly as a tool for removing dead skin from the body while in the shower. In this new effort, the researchers looked at luffa as a possible tool for generating small amounts of electricity.They first treated them with chemicals to remove hemicellulose and lignin, leaving behind a cellulose crystal shell. Then, they connected the results to an electrical circuit and began squeezing them over and over by hand. The research team found they were able to generate up to 8 nanoamps of electricity.They acknowledge that the amount of electricity generated is so small that it likely would not be of much use, but they also suggest that artificially created luffa sponges could be created that would be more efficient. They could also be made a lot bigger to generate useable amounts of electricity.More information: Yudi Jiang et al, The giant flexoelectric effect in a luffa plant-based sponge for green devices and energy harvesters, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2023).

Is The Sims a role-playing game?Gamers from around the world may have differing opinions, but this diversity of thought makes for better algorithms that help audiences everywhere pick the right games, according to new research from Cornell, Xbox and Microsoft Research.With the help of more than 5,000 gamers, researchers show that predictive models, fed on massive datasets labeled by gamers from different countries, offer better personalized gaming recommendations than those labeled by gamers from a single country.The team's findings and corresponding guidelines have broad application beyond gaming for researchers and practitioners who seek more globally applicable data labeling and, in turn, more accurate predictive artificial intelligence (AI) models.""We show that, in fact, you can do just as well, if not better, by diversifying the underlying data that goes into predictive models,"" said Allison Koenecke, assistant professor of information science in the Cornell Ann S. Bowers College of Computing and Information Science.Koenecke is the senior author of ""Auditing Cross-Cultural Consistency of Human-Annotated Labels for Recommendation Systems,"" which was presented at the Association for Computing Machinery Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT) conference, in June.Massive datasets inform the predictive models behind recommendation systems. The model's accuracy depends on its underlying data, especially the proper labeling of each individual piece within that massive trove. Researchers and practitioners are increasingly turning to crowdsourced workers to do this labeling for them, but crowdsourced workforces tend to be homogenous.During this data-labeling phase, cultural bias can creep in and, ultimately, skew a predictive model intended to serve global audiences, Koenecke said.""For the datasets used in algorithmic processes, someone still has to come up with either some rules or just some general idea of what it means for a data point to be labeled in some way,"" Koenecke said. ""That's where this human aspect comes in, because humans do have to be the decision makers at some point in this process.""The team surveyed 5,174 Xbox gamers from around the world to help label gaming titles. They were asked to apply labels like ""cozy,"" ""fantasy,"" or ""pacifist"" to games they had played, and to consider different factors, such as whether a title is low or high complexity, or the difficulty of the game controls.Some game labels—like ""zen,"" which is used to describe peaceful, calming games—were applied consistently across countries; others, like whether a game is ""replayable,"" were applied inconsistently. To explain these inconsistencies, the team used computational methods to find that both cultural differences among gamers and translational and linguistic quirks of certain labels contributed to labeling differences across countries.The researchers then built two models that could predict how gamers from each country would label a certain game—one was fed survey data from globally representative gamers, and the second used survey data from only U.S. gamers. They found that the model trained on labels from diverse global populations improved predictions by 8% for gamers everywhere when compared to the other model trained on labels from just American gamers.""We see improvement for everyone—even for gamers from the U.S.—when the training data is shifted from being entirely U.S.-centric to being more globally representative,"" Koenecke said.In addition to their findings, researchers crafted a framework to guide fellow researchers and practitioners on ways to audit underlying data labels to check for global inclusivity.""Companies tend to use homogeneous data labelers to do their data labeling, and if you're trying to build a global product, you'll run into issues,"" Koenecke said. ""With our framework, any academic researcher or practitioner could audit their own underlying data to see if they might be running into issues of representation via their data labels or choices.""More information: Rock Yuren Pang et al, Auditing Cross-Cultural Consistency of Human-Annotated Labels for Recommendation Systems, 2023 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (2023).

Without semiconductors, our computers would not be able to process and retain data; and LED (light-emitting diode) lightbulbs would lose their ability to shine.But semiconductor manufacturing requires a lot of energy. Forming semiconductor materials from sand (silicon oxide) consumes a significant amount of heat-intensive energy, at scorching temperatures of around 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit. And the process of purifying and assembling all the raw materials that go into making a semiconductor can take weeks if not months.A new semiconducting material called ""multielement ink"" could make that process significantly less heat-intensive and more sustainable. Developed by researchers from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and UC Berkeley, ""multielement ink"" is the first ""high-entropy"" semiconductor that can be processed at low-temperature or room temperature. The breakthrough was recently reported in the journal Nature.""The traditional way of making semiconductor devices is energy-intensive and one of the major sources of carbon emissions,"" said Peidong Yang, the senior author on the study. Yang is a faculty senior scientist in Berkeley Lab's Materials Sciences Division and professor of chemistry and materials science and engineering at UC Berkeley. ""Our new method of making semiconductors could pave the way for a more sustainable semiconductor industry.""The advance takes advantage of two unique families of semiconducting materials: hard alloys made of high-entropy semiconductors; and a soft, flexible material made of crystalline halide perovskites.High-entropy materials are solids made of five or more different chemical elements that self-assemble in near-equal proportions into a single system. For many years, researchers have wanted to use high-entropy materials to develop semiconducting materials that self-assemble with minimal energy inputs.""But high-entropy semiconductors have not been studied to nearly the same extent. Our work could help to significantly fill in that gap of understanding,"" said Yuxin Jiang, co-first author and graduate student researcher in the Peidong Yang group with Berkeley Lab's Materials Sciences Division and the department of chemistry at UC Berkeley.Although conventional high-entropy alloy materials require far less energy than silicon to process for manufacturing, they still demand very high temperatures of over 1000 degrees Celsius (or over 1832 degrees Fahrenheit). Scaling up high-entropy materials for industrial-scale manufacturing is challenging because of this enormous energy input.To overcome this hurdle, Yang and team then leveraged the unique qualities of a well-studied solar material that has intrigued researchers for many years: halide perovskites.Perovskites are easily processed from solution at low temperature—from room temperature to around 300 degrees Fahrenheit. These lower processing temperatures could one day dramatically reduce energy costs for semiconductor manufacturers.For the new study, Yang and team took advantage of this lower energy requirement to synthesize high-entropy halide persovskite single crystals from a solution under room temperature or low-temperature (80 degrees Celsius or 176 degrees Fahrenheit) conditions.Because of their ionic bonding nature, halide perovskite crystal structures require significantly lower energy to form as compared to other material systems, explained Yang.Experiments at Berkeley Lab's Advanced Light Source confirmed that the resulting octahedral and cuboctahedral crystals are high-entropy halide perovskite single crystals: one set made of five elements (SnTeReIrPt or ZrSnTeHfPt), and another set made of six elements (SnTeReOsIrPt or ZrSnTeHfRePt). The crystals are approximately 30–100 micrometers in diameter. (A micrometer is one billionth of a meter, which is about the size of a speck of dust.)The low-temperature/room-temperature technique produces single-crystal semiconductors within hours of mixing a solution and precipitating, far faster than conventional semiconductor fabrication techniques.""Intuitively, making these semiconductors is like stacking octahedral-shaped molecular 'LEGOs' into larger octahedral single crystals,"" said Yang. ""Imagining each of these individual molecular LEGOs will emit at different wavelengths, one can in principle design a semiconductor material that would emit an arbitrary color by selecting different molecular octahedral LEGOs,"" he explained. The authors demonstrated this concept by printing a California Golden Bears logo.Stability at ambient temperature has long been a problem for advancing commercial-ready halide perovskites, but in a benchtop experiment for the new study, the high-entropy ""multielement ink"" halide perovskite surprised the research team with an impressive ambient-air stability of at least six months.Yang said that the multielement ink has a number of potential applications, particularly as a color-tunable LED or other solid-state lighting device, or as a thermoelectric for waste heat recovery. In addition, the material could potentially serve as a programmable component in an optical computing device that uses light to transfer or store data.""Our high-entropy halide-perovskite semiconductor crystals, with their room-temperature and low-temperature methods, can be incorporated into an electronic device without destroying the other necessary layers, thus allowing for easier design of electronic devices and for more widespread use of high-entropy materials in electronic devices,"" said co-first author Maria Folgueras, a former graduate student fellow in the Peidong Yang group at Berkeley Lab and UC Berkeley.""One can imagine that each of these octahedral LEGOs could carry some type of 'genetic' information, just like DNA base pairs carry our genetic information,"" Yang said. ""It would be quite fascinating if one day we could code and decode these molecular LEGO semiconductors for information science applications.""The researchers next plan to continue designing sustainable semiconductor materials for solid-state lighting and display applications.More information: Maria C.

https://techxplore.com/news/2023-09-roof-material-cool-air-energy.html,Can a roof's material cool the outside air and lower energy demand?,"156TwitShareEmailSEPTEMBER 30, 2023by Marguerite Huber, Argonne National LaboratoryConcrete sidewalks, black asphalt streets, traffic, brick and steel buildings. These common city elements can retain heat and increase temperatures in a phenomenon called the urban heat island effect.With increasingly warming temperatures during the summer months, urban cities like Chicago need to arm decision makers and communities with information about strategies to help keep their residents cool. One strategy involves something all buildings already have: a roof. Certain roofing materials can help cool the surrounding outside air and decrease the need for air conditioning (AC).To help understand how climate is affecting urban communities, researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory examined three different types of roofing strategies and their impact on near-surface temperature and cooling energy demand through regional modeling in the Chicago metropolitan area.""We chose to run our model during a heat wave event—where temperatures cross the 95th percentile observed in a city for three consecutive days—as opposed to average summer temperatures so that we could maximize potential benefits,"" said Rao Kotamarthi, science director for Argonne's Center for Climate Resilience and Decision Science (CCRDS) and author of the study.The team ran a regional climate model simulating the Chicago metro area and three types of roofs: cool (painted a heat-reflecting white), green (vegetation) and solar panels.They found that the three types of roofs reduced the near-surface temperature and AC consumption demand during daytime hours when air temperature is the highest. Cool roofs reduced the near-surface temperature by 1.5 degrees Celsius, followed by 1.2 degrees for green roofs and 0.6 degrees for solar panel roofs across the Chicago area.Because all the roofing strategies offer cooling effects, they reduce AC consumption. Cool roofs reduced AC energy consumption the most, followed by green roofs and solar panel roofs. Energy demand was shown to be reduced by 16.6%, 14.0%, and 7.6%, when cool roofs, green roofs and solar panel roofs are deployed, respectively.Overall, the large-scale deployment of cool roofs showed the best potential for cooling effects and cooling energy saving. They cost less than the other two technologies, and they do not require additional water. However, they are not helpful in managing stormwater loads as green roofs have the potential to do. Stakeholders can use results of the study to inform sustainable development approaches, lower summertime cooling energy demand, and help minimize greenhouse gas emissions in the long term over the Chicago region.This work was conducted as part of the Community Research on Climate & Urban Science (CROCUS) Urban Integrated Field Laboratory. CROCUS is led by Argonne in partnership with academic and community organizations and civic and industry champions. Focused on the Chicago region, CROCUS studies urban climate change and its implications for environmental justice.The results of this baseline study will help CROCUS communities plan and test mitigation options. The researchers will work closely with CROCUS community organizations and members.""The difference in cost between the roofs is approximately a factor of three,"" said Kotamarthi, who is also the CROCUS science director. ""Which option is the most cost effective to get the most benefit? If a community is deciding on a strategy, we can look at the model and give them an actual answer.""And the results are a good starting point for what the researchers hope to achieve next, a city-scale and global-scale model for each of the roofing options. But how do you incorporate a green roof into a computer model? First, researchers will work to better understand green roofs by taking measurements at surface and building levels to improve on how a green roof is represented.""We have very few measurements for green roofs,"" said Kotamarthi. ""We need to measure how much energy goes in, how much goes out, and how much water it needs and how fast it retains it. We need these measurements to give us a complete understanding of the process so we can refine calculations and models.""Researchers will measure the roofs of CROCUS partners throughout the city. For instance, Northeastern Illinois University has both roof types, while other partner buildings have solar panels.Finally, the researchers want to improve the resolution of the model all the way down to street scale. Kotamarthi explained that achieving this will help them see the difference between houses and streets, which is important because it will help answer questions such as, if a tree is planted, how much does it cool the nearby building and the pavement?The team's research used supercomputing resources at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF) and the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC). The ALCF and NERSC are DOE Office of Science user facilities located at Argonne and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, respectively.More information: Haochen Tan et al, Impact of different roofing mitigation strategies on near-surface temperature and energy consumption over the Chicago metropolitan area during a heatwave event, Science of The Total Environment (2022).

It didn't specify a timeline for when its own software fix would be issued but said no safety issues should prevent iPhone 15 owners from using their devices while awaiting the update.""We have identified a few conditions which can cause iPhone to run warmer than expected,"" Apple in a short statement provided to The Associated Press after media reports detailed overheating complaints that are peppering online message boards.The Wall Street Journal amplified the worries in a story citing the overheating problem in its own testing of the new iPhones, which went on sale a week ago.It's not unusual for new iPhones to get uncomfortably warm during the first few days of use or when they are being restored with backup information stored in the cloud—issues that Apple already flags for users. The devices also can get hot when using apps such as video games and augmented reality technology that require a lot of processing power, but the heating issues with the iPhone 15 models have gone beyond those typical situations.In its acknowledgement, Apple stressed that the trouble isn't related to the sleek titanium casing that houses the high-end iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max instead of the stainless steel used on older smartphones.Apple also dismissed speculation that the overheating problem in the new models might be tied to a shift from its proprietary Lightning charging cable to the more widely used USB-C port that allowed it to comply with a mandate issued by European regulators.Although Apple expressed confidence that the overheating issue can be quickly fixed with the upcoming software updates, the problem still could dampen sales of its marquee product at time when the company has faced three consecutive quarters of year-over-year declines in overall sales.The downturn has affected iPhone sales, which fell by a combined 4% in the nine months covered by Apple's past three fiscal quarters compared with a year earlier.Apple is trying to pump up its sales in part by raising the starting price for its top-of-the-line iPhone 15 Pro Max to $1,200, an increase of $100, or 9%, from last year's comparable model.Investor worries about Apple's uncharacteristic sales funk already have wiped out more than $300 billion in shareholder wealth since the company's market value closed at $3 trillion for the first time in late June.© 2023 The Associated Press.

https://techxplore.com/news/2023-09-multi-purpose-robot.html,New multi-purpose robot changes shape for different uses,"35TwitShareEmailSEPTEMBER 29, 2023by University of BristolResearchers have designed a robot which can change form to tackle varying scenarios.A team at the University of Bristol and based at the Bristol Robotics Laboratory have built a tetrahedron shaped robot with flexible piping known as Tetraflex that can move through small gaps or over challenging terrain. It can also encapsulate fragile objects such as an egg and transport them safely within its soft body.The findings, ""Tetraflex: A Multigait Soft Robot for Object Transportation in Confined Environments,"" published in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, show that the Tetraflex robot is capable of locomoting in multiple different ways. This makes the robot potentially useful for mobility in a challenging or confined environments such as navigating rubble to reach survivors of an earthquake, performing oil rig inspections or even exploring other planets.The object transport capability demonstrated also adds another dimension to potential applications. This could be used to pick up and transport payloads from otherwise inaccessible locations, helping with ecological surveying or in nuclear decommissioning.Lead author Peter Wharton from Bristol's School of Engineering Mathematics and Technology explained, ""The robot is composed of soft struts connected by rigid nodes. Each strut is formed of an airtight rubber bellow and the length of the strut can be controlled by varying the air pressure within the bellow.""Higher pressures cause the bellow to extend, and lower pressures cause it to contract. By controlling the pressure in each bellow simultaneously we can control the robot shape and size change.""After this, it was simply a matter of experimenting with different patterns of shape change that would generate useful motions such as rolling or crawling along a surface.""Their design uses soft struts which can change length freely and independently. By changing the lengths of the struts by the right amount and in the right sequence, they can generate multiple different ways such as rolling or crawling), change the size of the robot, and even envelop and transport payloads.Peter said, ""I would say these capabilities are a natural consequence of working with such a versatile structure and we hope that other interesting capabilities can be developed in the future.""The most exciting aspect of this study for me is the versatility of Tetraflex and how we might be able to use these robots to explore challenging terrain and achieve tasks in areas humans cannot access. The multiple gaits available to Tetraflex and object transport capability show this versatility well.""The team have already enjoyed some success, entering an earlier version of Tetraflex in the RoboSoft 2022 Locomotion Competition in Edinburgh and coming third, demonstrating movement over sand, through small gaps and between obstacles.After exploring some capabilities of Tetraflex in locomotion and object transport, they now plan to apply machine learning algorithms which could allow them to really thoroughly explore movement patterns, as well as optimizing their current ones.He added, ""There could be some really creative and effective ways of moving around or interacting with the environment that we haven't yet discovered.""More information: P.

https://techxplore.com/news/2023-09-light-activated-acid-energy-efficient-on-demand-captured.html,"Light-activated acid drives energy-efficient, on-demand release of captured carbon dioxide","59TwitShareEmailSEPTEMBER 28, 2023by Dawn Levy, Oak Ridge National LaboratoryUsing light instead of heat, researchers at the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory have found a new way to release carbon dioxide (CO2) from a solvent used in direct air capture, or DAC, to trap this greenhouse gas. The novel approach paves the way for economically viable separation of CO2 from the atmosphere.The on-demand release of carbon dioxide is possible because the long-lived excited state of a novel acid controls the solution's proton concentration using ultraviolet light, creating conditions that lead to CO2's energy-efficient release. By contrast, current DAC technologies filter air through an aqueous solution containing a sorbent material, such as an amino acid, that takes up atmospheric CO2 and holds it. Heating the solvent releases the CO2 and regenerates the amino acid for recycling. The CO2 can be either stored or converted into value-added products, such as ethanol, polymers or concrete.""In the existing direct-air-capture technologies, CO2 release and sorbent regeneration are the most energy-intensive steps,"" said ORNL chemist Yingzhong Ma, who led the study published in Angewandte Chemie International Edition with ORNL colleagues Radu Custelcean and Uvinduni Premadasa, both chemists. ""The goal here is to use the amino acid sorbent, which is recyclable and has a lot of attractive properties, combined with a more energy-efficient approach to release the CO2 and regenerate the sorbent.""The National Academy of Sciences has concluded that DAC technologies have a role in removing billions of tons of CO2 from the atmosphere annually to help limit the rise in average global temperature to less than 2 degrees Celsius (about 4 degrees Fahrenheit). However, the intensive energy cost associated with sorbent regeneration and CO2 release at a scale that would mitigate climate change makes such a massive deployment a grand challenge necessitating the development of new DAC processes. The ORNL-led approach provided a proof of concept for using irradiation with ultraviolet light under ambient conditions instead of heating the solution to release the CO2 and regenerate the sorbent.""Heating aqueous solutions is a common regeneration method, but it is extremely energy intensive,"" said Custelcean, a pioneer in DAC. ""We wanted to take heat out of the equation.""Custelcean led a study in 2017 that proved a guanidine sorbent could directly capture CO2 from air. In 2018, he and colleagues demonstrated a practical, energy-efficient DAC method using solar heat to drive the release of the greenhouse gas from an amino-acid sorbent. This year, Knoxville-based startup Holocene licensed the technology to prepare it for industrial deployment.In this new development, the key to releasing CO2 at ambient conditions is a photoacid, which is a molecule that becomes more acidic when it absorbs light. Shine a light on an acid such as vinegar and nothing happens. By contrast, expose a photoacid to ultraviolet or visible light, and a chemical group in the middle of the acid rotates from the opposite side of a bond to the same side. A subsequent reaction forms a ring, leading to transfer of a proton, or hydrogen ion, to the water solvent.This transfer dramatically increases the acidity of the solution, producing a change called a ""pH swing."" The excess protons can now interact with bicarbonate, or HCO3–, which was made when CO2 reacted with the sorbent. The bicarbonate accepts a proton to become carbonic acid, or H2CO3, which is just one energetically favorable step away from carbon dioxide and water.""This paper describes the first time where the macroscopic pH swing lasting from minutes to hours has been demonstrated using light as an external trigger to initiate the CO2 regeneration reaction,"" said Vyacheslav ""Slava"" Bryantsev, leader of ORNL's Chemical Separations group and a co-author of the paper.""You can easily turn light on and off to control the reaction reversibly,"" Ma said. ""You can capture CO2 in the dark and then simply turn on the light when you want to release CO2 for storage or for making value-added products. It gives you a way to easily control the process on demand.""That said, the researchers needed an additional trick of the light. Conventional photoacids would not work because the lifetimes of their excited states are very short—mere nanoseconds. They lose protons but then stay mostly in the same configuration. ""Then you only change the acidity for a short time,"" Bryantsev said.Ma and Custelcean, who conceived the idea of using a photoacid to trigger CO2 release in DAC applications, ran into this problem when they began experiments using a commercially available photoacid.""When carbonic acid decomposes, it has a short lifetime in water, on the order of a few seconds. But that's an infinity compared to the lifetime of a regular photoacid, which is nanoseconds, or billionths of seconds,"" Custelcean said. ""That's why you cannot do this chemistry with a regular photoacid: It takes seconds to release CO2 from carbonic acid, but it takes only nanoseconds for the photoacid to take the proton back.""Bryantsev came up with the idea to try a different class of photoacid with a long-lived excited state. Called a metastable-state photoacid, it has a structure that persists in solution from seconds to hours. That means the pH change driven by the photoacid's structural change also lasts a lot longer.The scientists invited an expert in photoacid design and synthesis to join the team. Florida Institute of Technology's Yi Liao had pioneered the new class of metastable-state photoacids around 2015 but for purposes other than DAC.""We really made a breakthrough after we got this photoacid from our collaborator,"" Ma said.Custelcean agreed. ""Having a metastable-state photoacid gave us plenty of time to release the proton and form the carbonic acid. Then the carbonic acid had time to release the CO2 in water. Once that happens, CO2 leaves the solution,"" he said.With Ma, first author Premadasa designed and conducted the experiments for the proof-of-concept study using a metastable-state photoacid synthesized by Liao and Florida Tech colleague Adnan Elgattar, with subsequent spectroscopic characterization by ORNL's Benjamin Doughty and Vera Bocharova.""Once we baselined the photochemical properties of the acid itself, our next step was to test its applicability for CO2 release with various DAC sorbents,"" Premadasa said. ""We can easily manipulate chemical compositions and intensities and colors of light to drive the photoreaction for efficient CO2 release.""Audrey Miles from the University of Notre Dame and Stella Belony from the University of Florida, who were DOE Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internships students at the time of the study, tested the photoacid under different conditions for its CO2-releasing abilities. Then ORNL's Michelle Kidder, Diana Stamberga and Joshua Damron measured the amount of CO2 released under those different conditions.Many challenges remain to develop ORNL's light-activated DAC technology. One is understanding the dynamics by which the photoacid forms a chemical complex with the amino acid sorbent. Another is improving the solubility of compounds in water. Yet another is optimizing the absorption of light from the visible spectrum. Moreover, the scientists would like to decrease the time required to regenerate the photoacid and improve understanding of its long-term stability.Regardless, the future is bright for metastable-state photoacids. ""Our study paves the way towards photochemically driven approaches for CO2 release and sorbent regeneration using solar light,"" Premadasa said.The title of the paper is ""Photochemically-Driven CO2 Release Using a Metastable-State Photoacid for Energy Efficient Direct Air Capture.""More information: Uvinduni I.
