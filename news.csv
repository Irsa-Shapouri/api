https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-liquid-iron-battery-grid-energy.html,New all-liquid iron flow battery for grid energy storage,"Flow batteries is a topic of interest in the field of energy storage. Researchers at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have made significant progress in developing a new battery design using a common chemical found in water treatment facilities. This design offers a safe, economical, and water-based solution for large-scale energy storage.

The researchers have successfully repurposed a chemical called nitrogenous triphosphonate, or NTMPA, which is commonly used to prevent corrosion in water treatment plants. By combining NTMPA with charged iron and a neutral-pH phosphate-based liquid electrolyte, they have created an iron-based flow battery that exhibits remarkable cycling stability and high charge capacity over a thousand consecutive charging cycles.

Iron-based flow batteries have been around since the 1980s, but what sets this battery apart is the use of NTMPA as the energy carrier. This chemical is readily available in industrial quantities, making it an attractive choice for large-scale energy storage applications. Furthermore, NTMPA belongs to a family of phosphonates that are non-toxic and have various other uses, such as in fertilizers and detergents.

Flow batteries operate by storing energy in chemical bonds and releasing it when needed. Unlike conventional batteries, flow batteries consist of two chambers filled with different liquids, which serve as the electrolyte. These liquids are constantly circulating through the battery, supplying the electrolyte and enabling energy storage. The size of the electrolyte supply tank determines the amount of energy the flow battery can store.

Flow batteries have the potential to revolutionize the electric grid by providing a means to store energy from renewable sources like wind and solar power. They can be built at any scale, from small lab-bench models to large systems capable of powering entire city blocks. The use of aqueous flow batteries, like the one developed by the research team, offers advantages in terms of safety and accessibility. These batteries operate in water at neutral pH, making them less prone to accidents or environmental hazards.

The initial design of the iron-based flow battery developed by the researchers exhibits an energy density of up to 9 watt-hours per liter (Wh/L). While this is lower than the energy density of commercialized vanadium-based systems, which can reach 25 Wh/L, the use of Earth-abundant materials in the iron-based battery allows for scalability. This means that a system built with these materials can provide the same energy output as a higher density battery while being more sustainable and cost-effective.

The development of flow batteries holds great promise for the future of energy storage. As grid operators seek to integrate renewable energy sources into the electric grid, the need for reliable and efficient energy storage solutions becomes increasingly important. The iron-based flow battery design developed by the researchers at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory offers a viable option that is both safe and environmentally friendly. With further development and optimization, flow batteries could become a key component in the transition to a clean and sustainable energy future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/new-all-liquid-iron-fl.jpg,2024-03-25 07:22:25,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/intel-amd-fall-report-china-blocks-us-chips-state-computers-2024-03-25/,"Intel, AMD sales to take hit from China curbing use of U.S. chips, analysts warn","Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) could face significant losses if China restricts the use of their chips and servers in government computers, according to Wall Street analysts. As part of its efforts to reduce reliance on foreign firms and develop its domestic semiconductor industry, China is implementing measures in response to U.S. export curbs on technology, including cutting-edge chips. The potential impact on the chip manufacturers' earnings is substantial, as China represented Intel's largest market in 2023, accounting for 27% of its revenue, while AMD generated about 15% of its sales from the country. Microsoft's revenue from China is not disclosed.

Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon predicts that a complete cessation of China's governmental purchases of Intel and AMD CPUs could result in a revenue hit of low-single digits. This translates to a potential loss of up to $1.5 billion for Intel and several hundred million dollars for AMD. However, Intel may face a greater impact on its profit due to its higher exposure and cost structure. Intel, AMD, and Microsoft declined to comment on the matter. Following the news, Intel's shares dropped by 1.6%, Microsoft's by 1%, and AMD's initially fell but eventually traded marginally higher.

In late December, China's industry ministry released a statement identifying three separate lists of central processing units, operating systems, and centralized databases that were deemed ""safe and reliable"" for three years, all from Chinese firms. This move further emphasizes China's intention to strengthen its local semiconductor industry and decrease its reliance on foreign technology.

These developments are not unique to the semiconductor industry. Apple has also faced challenges in the escalating tensions between the United States and China. In December, Bloomberg News reported that Chinese agencies and state-backed firms instructed their staff not to bring iPhones to work.

In conclusion, the potential limitations on the use of Intel and AMD chips and servers in China's government computers could result in significant financial losses for both companies. As China represents a substantial portion of their revenue, the impact could be in the billions of dollars. These restrictions are part of China's broader strategy to reduce reliance on foreign technology and bolster its domestic semiconductor industry. The escalating tensions between the United States and China have also affected other industries, with Apple being caught up in the dispute as well. The long-term implications of these actions remain to be seen, but it is clear that the stakes are high for all parties involved.",https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NBXBTWIHCJL3XPIHOIMT4QNK5M.jpg?auth=b425411ee327e8c10980cfd66799507672d2aef7f0d2d41e9ef47aa81c495293&width=1920&height=1005&smart=true,2024-03-25 10:39:54,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/espn-adding-local-sports-to-its-app-and-website-is-your-team-there-yet/,ESPN adding local sports to its app and website - is your team there yet?,"ESPN is taking steps to make its streaming offerings more comprehensive in the face of a growing number of fragmented streaming services. In the coming months, sports fans will be able to watch broadcasts from several regional sports networks (RSNs) directly on the ESPN app and website.

Subscribers to NESN, which covers Boston-area sports teams like the Red Sox, Celtics, Patriots, and Bruins, can now access live games from these teams on the ESPN site or app. Monumental Sports Network, which covers the Washington D.C.-area Capitals, Wizards, and Mystics, will be added next month. SportsNet Pittsburgh, hosting Penguins, Pirates, and WVU games, is also confirmed to be joining. Other RSNs are expected to follow suit.

In recent years, many sports franchises have signed agreements to broadcast games on regional sports networks. These networks, which typically host multiple teams from a city or region, can be part of a cable package or standalone but usually require an additional subscription.

While a subscription to these specific networks is still necessary to watch games, ESPN's partnership makes it much easier for fans to find and access them. The actual streams will still come from the provider websites, and the content will remain available in RSN apps. However, the collaboration with ESPN streamlines the process for viewers.

For regional networks, this increased discoverability is significant. When a game is easier to find and a link to it is available through an app they already use, customers are more likely to subscribe. Simultaneously, teams aim to make games more accessible to a broader audience, making this partnership beneficial for both parties. No additional charges are being added; it is simply a matter of convenience for fans.

ESPN clarified that these links will only be visible to individuals living in the coverage areas for those networks. This means that if you don't have access to a specific game, you won't see the option to click on it.

This move by ESPN comes after the company's announcement last month of a partnership with Fox and Warner Bros. to launch a streaming service covering nearly every major and minor sports league. With the combination of these three rivals, fans will have access to MLB, NFL, NBA, NHL, NCAA football and basketball, NASCAR, PGA Tour, Grand Slam tennis, soccer, and more, all in one app.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/83df13de495fcfec3cffb77378df0e2ad3591ce2/2024/03/25/fd31c575-1031-497a-845f-afbf4b97b11c/pxl-20240325-185459546.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation

They often provide incorrect information or display inconsistencies in their responses. This can be frustrating for those seeking accurate details about upcoming eclipses.

For example, when asked about the next total solar eclipse, ChatGPT initially responded with incorrect information, stating that the next one occurred in December 2020 in South America. However, after asking again, it provided the correct date of April 8, 2024, visible from parts of North America.

Interestingly, when asked about the eclipse following April 8, 2024, ChatGPT gave an odd reply, mentioning an eclipse on August 23, 2044. While there will indeed be an eclipse on that date, it is not the next one. In fact, between April 8, 2024, and August 23, 2044, there will be 13 total solar eclipses. This suggests that ChatGPT may be biased towards events in the contiguous United States, neglecting eclipses happening in other regions.

Furthermore, when asked about the eclipse following August 23, 2044, ChatGPT provided another incorrect response, mentioning a total solar eclipse on March 20, 2053. However, the actual next eclipse after August 23, 2044, will occur on August 12, 2045, which is considered the ""Greatest American Eclipse"" of all. While there will indeed be an eclipse on March 20, 2053, it will not be a total solar eclipse.

In contrast, Gemini, Google's AI model engine, formerly known as Bard, proves to be more reliable. It consistently provides accurate information about the next total solar eclipse, specifying that it will happen on April 8, 2024, visible across parts of North America. It even goes the extra mile by letting users know if they will be able to witness the eclipse from their location.

It is disappointing to discover that AI chatbots lack knowledge about celestial events that have been meticulously calculated for centuries. This revelation raises concerns about relying on AI for accurate advice, especially for eclipse enthusiasts who depend on precise information.

Therefore, if you are seeking the most up-to-date and reliable details about total solar eclipses, it is recommended to consult trusted sources and experts in the field. For comprehensive information about the latest total solar eclipse, including travel and lodging options, stay tuned to reliable sources for daily updates.

May your skies be clear and your eyes wide open to witness the awe-inspiring beauty of total solar eclipses.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66016f04433add21d5071fb4/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2004,1128,x10,y411,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 13:00:51,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.reuters.com/technology/musks-x-corp-loses-lawsuit-against-hate-speech-watchdog-2024-03-25/,Musk's X Corp loses lawsuit against hate speech watchdog,"Introduction:
On March 25, a U.S. judge dismissed Elon Musk's lawsuit against the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), a nonprofit group that criticized his social media platform, X (formerly known as Twitter). The judge stated that Musk's motive behind the lawsuit was to punish CCDH for their criticism and deter others from engaging in similar criticism. This decision comes as a blow to Musk, who has positioned himself as a champion of free speech but has faced backlash for allowing hate speech and abuse on X. X plans to appeal the ruling.

Background:
Elon Musk, the world's third-richest person, faced criticism after his acquisition of Twitter for $44 billion in 2022. Many accused him of firing too many people responsible for policing misinformation and allowing harmful and abusive posts. The Center for Countering Digital Hate, led by Imran Ahmed, argued that social media companies should be held accountable for decisions made behind closed doors. Roberta Kaplan, a lawyer for the nonprofit, emphasized that Musk cannot manipulate the rule of law to his advantage.

Legal Challenges:
Apart from the lawsuit against CCDH, Musk and X have faced various other legal challenges. Former Twitter executives have accused Musk of improperly withholding severance payments, while vendors have claimed non-payment. Tesla, the electric vehicle maker led by Musk, has also faced lawsuits alleging worker harassment, which the company denies.

X's Accusations:
X accused CCDH of breaching their 2019 user contract by using selective data to create misleading reports, which claimed that X had become a platform for hate speech, extremism, and misinformation. X argued that CCDH's campaign aimed to drive advertisers away, causing significant financial damages. X contended that CCDH should have been bound by Musk's policy changes and could have left Twitter if they disagreed with them.

The Judge's Ruling:
Judge Charles Breyer agreed that X's desire to address criticism was reasonable from a business standpoint. However, he pointed out that CCDH could not have anticipated Musk taking over and changing the moderation policies when they joined Twitter. The judge dismissed X's claims against the European Climate Foundation, which X accused of conspiring with CCDH to illegally gather data.

Controversies Surrounding Elon Musk:
Elon Musk himself has been involved in controversies regarding his speech on social media. In November 2023, he endorsed an antisemitic post on X, claiming that members of the Jewish community were fueling hatred against white people. Musk later denied being antisemitic and attempted to make amends by visiting Auschwitz, a former Nazi death camp.

Conclusion:
The dismissal of Elon Musk's lawsuit against the Center for Countering Digital Hate is a setback for the billionaire entrepreneur. It highlights the importance of holding social media companies accountable for their content moderation policies. While Musk has positioned himself as a champion of free speech, criticism has mounted against him for allowing hate speech and abuse on X. As X plans to appeal the ruling, it remains to be seen how this legal battle will unfold and its implications for the future of social media platforms.",https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/L3HQXOH3LRM25A2FS6FZCIAPBY.jpg?auth=f4b6644b6d3e5642f7eb30ba3b3dd5ed1fdf37ed92a912c772bf64e0ddd35c75&width=1920&height=1005&smart=true,2024-03-25 15:28:13,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobinglis/2024/03/25/avoiding-the-judgment-of-history/,Avoiding The Judgment Of History,"Art Laffer, a prominent economist and former advisor to President Ronald Reagan, recently had a meeting with former President Trump to discuss the possibility of replacing Jerome Powell as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Laffer has also expressed support for a revenue-neutral carbon tax as an effective market-based solution to combat climate change.

In the face of climate skeptics, Kim Beazley, Australia's former ambassador to the US, emphasizes the importance of taking a stand on climate change. Beazley believes that it is crucial for future generations to know where individuals stood on this pressing issue. 

Recently, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a non-binding resolution condemning a carbon tax, despite the fact that carbon pricing is widely considered the most effective means of addressing climate change. This resolution, proposed by Rep. Ryan Zinke and previously by Rep. Steve Scalise, indicates a lack of awareness regarding two key features of a well-designed carbon tax. Firstly, it can be made revenue-neutral by offsetting it with a reduction in an existing tax, ensuring that there is no growth of government. Secondly, it can be made border-adjustable by applying the tax to imports from countries that have not yet implemented pollution taxes.

Interestingly, during the same week that the carbon tax resolution passed, news emerged that Art Laffer had met with Donald Trump to discuss the possibility of Laffer replacing Jerome Powell as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Additionally, there were reports that Kevin Hassett was being considered for the position. Both Laffer and Hassett have advocated for addressing climate change through a carbon tax paired with a dollar-for-dollar reduction in existing taxes.

Laffer and Hassett draw inspiration from Arthur Cecil Pigou, an influential economist from the early 20th century. Both economists are members of the Pigou Club, founded by Harvard economist Greg Mankiw, who served as Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush. Pigou's proposition that we should tax things we want less of and untax things we want more of resonates with Laffer and Hassett's approach. They believe that taxing carbon pollution instead of payroll income, while simultaneously reducing taxes on low-wage workers, would address the issue of regressivity often associated with carbon taxes. This approach would also strengthen Social Security, which relies on payroll taxes, by broadening its tax base.

The authors of the carbon tax resolution appear to be unaware that existing World Trade Organization rules allow for the application of a carbon tax to imports from countries that do not have their own carbon tax in place. This is known as a border adjustment. Other countries would quickly recognize that it is not in their best interest to pay carbon tax revenue to the United States. Consequently, they would follow suit and implement their own carbon pollution fees. As a result, people worldwide would start to see the true cost of burning fossil fuels, and products made with greener and cleaner processes would become more affordable compared to those produced using dirty methods.

This approach aligns with Pigou's philosophy, as he argued that negative externalities, which refer to costs that companies and individuals impose on society, create market distortions that hinder innovation. By implementing a carbon tax, these externalities can be internalized and incentivize companies to invest in cleaner technologies. This idea was also supported by Dr. Milton Friedman, one of President Reagan's economic advisers, who suggested taxing companies that engage in harmful practices.

It is important to note that both Republicans and Democrats have been involved in the carbon tax resolution. However, the resolution is non-binding, and the mistake can be rectified. It is never too late to correct our course and work towards a sustainable future.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6601d28de733bba2fcac676c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 15:47:48,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-deep-geothermal-renewable-powerhouse.html,Dig deep: US bets on geothermal to become renewable powerhouse,"Geothermal energy, although currently a small part of US energy production, is gaining attention from businesses and the Biden administration as a potential key player in the transition to green energy. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm believes that harnessing the heat beneath our feet can provide clean, reliable, and scalable power for various industries and households. The Department of Energy predicts that geothermal energy could surpass hydroelectric and solar power in the US by 2050. Geothermal, which utilizes high temperatures underground to generate electricity and heat buildings, only accounted for 1.6 percent of US energy consumption in 2022.

To increase geothermal production, the US government has invested over $200 million since 2018 in an experimental site in Utah. This site focuses on Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), a technology that involves injecting water into naturally hot rocks deep underground. EGS does not require a nearby hot spring or underground reservoir, making it a versatile method for geothermal energy extraction. This approach reduces upfront risks, such as drilling without finding any resources, which has deterred some investors in the past. Additionally, the US government allows companies to convert permits for oil or gas exploration into geothermal licenses, reducing paperwork and delays.

Compared to classic fracking, EGS uses fewer chemical additives and does not release hydrocarbons. Geothermal energy also provides a continuous flow of power regardless of weather conditions or time of day, unlike solar or wind energy. The cost of geothermal energy is projected to decrease from the current range of $70 to $100 per megawatt hour (MWh) to $45 by 2035. The use of existing drilling technology makes geothermal development quicker and more cost-effective.

The US has been at the forefront of adopting this new geothermal technology. Other countries, including France, have experimental EGS sites, but the US remains a pioneer in the field. Geothermal drilling projects, like fracking, can cause seismic activity, which is a potential risk. However, the US Energy Department requires all funded projects to follow a mitigation protocol to address induced seismicity.

Several start-ups in the US and Canada have raised substantial investments to position themselves in the growing geothermal market. Fervo Energy, for example, partnered with Google to connect its Nevada site to the electric grid. Demand for geothermal energy is also increasing, with companies like Google, Microsoft, and Nucor jointly purchasing geothermal energy. These companies are willing to pay a premium for this renewable energy source, which excites the private sector and encourages further growth in the market.

While the geothermal energy sector is still relatively small, industry experts believe that the key to its expansion lies in successfully building the first commercial facility. Once one company demonstrates its viability, others are likely to follow suit. The focus is on growing the sector in a sustainable and responsible manner. Geothermal energy has the potential to be a significant player in the green energy transition, providing clean and reliable power for a variety of industries and households.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/a-worker-operates-a-dr.jpg,2024-03-25 04:59:03,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.reuters.com/technology/spanish-court-suspends-order-blocking-telegram-pending-police-report-2024-03-25/,Spanish court suspends order blocking Telegram pending police report,"Spain's High Court has suspended its own order to block Telegram's messaging app in the country while awaiting a police report on the potential impact of the ban on users. The temporary ban was initially set due to claims by media companies that Telegram allowed users to upload content without permission. However, Judge Santiago Pedraz has decided to halt the enforcement of the order and instead requested a report from national police on the characteristics of Telegram and the potential impact of the suspension on its users. The court had also requested information on the identities of users suspected of illegally sharing protected content from the Virgin Islands, but the authorities there failed to comply with the request. Spanish consumers' association FACUA has welcomed the court's decision and hopes that the police report will lead to the revocation of the order. Telegram is currently the fourth most-used messaging service in Spain, with nearly 19% of Spaniards surveyed using the app.

The decision by Spain's High Court to suspend the ban on Telegram's services demonstrates a pause for reflection and a recognition of the potential consequences of such a move. While it is important to protect copyright and prevent illegal content sharing, it is equally crucial to ensure that users are not unduly affected or deprived of their communication tools.

Telegram, founded by Russian-born billionaire Pavel Durov, has gained popularity worldwide for its secure and private messaging features. The app has been praised for its encryption protocols, which ensure that users' messages and data remain confidential. With concerns growing over privacy in the digital age, Telegram has positioned itself as a reliable alternative to other messaging platforms.

The court's decision to seek a police report on Telegram's characteristics and the potential impact of the ban on users is a positive step. It shows a commitment to gathering all the necessary information before making a final decision. This approach ensures that any actions taken are well-informed and based on a thorough understanding of the situation.

It is worth noting that Telegram is not the only messaging app facing scrutiny over content sharing. Many other platforms, including social media giants like Facebook and Twitter, have faced similar accusations. The challenge lies in finding the right balance between protecting intellectual property rights and preserving freedom of expression and communication.

The court's request for information on users suspected of illegally sharing protected content is also understandable. It is essential to hold individuals accountable for their actions and prevent copyright infringement. However, it is equally important to respect users' privacy rights and ensure that any investigations are conducted within the bounds of the law.

Telegram's popularity in Spain, with nearly 19% of Spaniards surveyed using the app, underscores the importance of this decision. Messaging apps have become an integral part of people's daily lives, facilitating communication, collaboration, and information sharing. Any disruption to these services can have a significant impact on individuals, businesses, and the overall functioning of society.

Moving forward, it is crucial to strike a balance between protecting intellectual property rights and ensuring the continued availability and accessibility of communication tools. This can be achieved through dialogue, collaboration, and the development of robust mechanisms to address copyright infringement while safeguarding users' rights.

In conclusion, the decision by Spain's High Court to suspend the ban on Telegram's services and seek a police report on the potential impact is a positive development. It reflects a commitment to thorough examination and consideration of the issue at hand.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/03/25/social-media-could-counter-putin-claim-of-kyivs-involvement-in-terrorist-attack/,Social Media Could Counter Putin Claim Of Kyiv’s Involvement In Terrorist Attack,"Russian President Vladimir Putin is using the recent terrorist attack in Moscow to allege a link between the attack and Ukraine. However, he has made no mention of the Islamic State group, which claimed responsibility for the attack, and has ignored Kyiv's denial of involvement. This tactic is reminiscent of Putin's past strategies, such as blaming Chechens for apartment bombings to rally support for Russia's war in Chechnya. By accusing Ukraine of supporting the attackers, Putin is using a ""liar's dividend"" to mix truth with misinformation and create doubt among the Russian population.

The majority of Russians rely on state-controlled media for their news, but social media provides an alternative source of information that may set the record straight. However, the Kremlin may attempt to flood social media channels with disinformation to confuse people and hinder the spread of accurate information. While flooding has been effective in other countries, Russia's lack of a strict internet firewall has allowed some foreign social media platforms to remain accessible. The Telegram messaging app is also used by Russian military bloggers and officials for propaganda purposes, further contributing to the spread of misinformation.

However, Putin's attempt to blame Ukraine for the attack could backfire and raise questions about the rationale for Russia's invasion two years ago and the conduct of the war. The Russian government has used social media channels, including Telegram, to shape the narrative in its favor. Telegram channels like the ""War on Fakes"" spread disinformation to counter what they claim is Ukrainian propaganda. Despite these efforts, there are also Telegram channels that share factual news about events in Ukraine.

Overall, Putin's use of the ""liar's dividend"" and his attempt to link Ukraine to the terrorist attack in Moscow highlight the importance of independent and accurate information sources. Social media provides an opportunity for the truth to prevail, but it may also be vulnerable to disinformation campaigns. The Russian government's control over traditional media outlets and its use of social media for propaganda purposes demonstrate the need for a critical and discerning audience. By questioning the information they receive and seeking multiple sources, Russians can navigate through the sea of misinformation and find the truth.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6601e0acedb5ad5a83d52887/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 16:43:51,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.zdnet.com/article/five-linux-file-and-folder-management-commands-you-need-to-know/,Five Linux file and folder management commands you need to know,"Linux, with its vast array of commands, can be quite overwhelming for new users. However, mastering a few essential commands can significantly enhance your file and folder management skills. In this blog post, we'll explore five more Linux commands that every user should learn.

1. Create Directories with 'mkdir'
The 'mkdir' command is used to make directories or folders. To create a new directory, simply use the command:
```
mkdir FOLDER
```
Replace 'FOLDER' with the desired name for your directory. For example, if you want to create a directory named 'TEST' within your current working directory, you can use the following command:
```
mkdir ~/TEST
```
In case you want to create a nested directory structure, such as 'TEST/project1', you can utilize the '-p' option with the 'mkdir' command:
```
mkdir -p ~/TEST/project1
```
This will first create the 'TEST' directory and then create the 'project1' directory inside it.

2. View File Contents with 'less'
To view the contents of a file, the 'less' command comes in handy. It allows you to view files one page at a time, enabling easy scrolling and line-by-line reading. For instance, if you want to view the contents of the '/etc/samba/smb.conf' file, use the following command:
```
less /etc/samba/smb.conf
```
The 'less' command is particularly useful when you only need to view files without the intention to edit them.

3. Concatenate Files with 'cat'
The 'cat' command concatenates files and prints their contents to the terminal. With 'cat', you can display the contents of a file directly in the terminal window. For example, to view the contents of the '/etc/fstab' file, you can use:
```
cat /etc/fstab
```
Additionally, 'cat' can be used to append the content of one file to the end of another. Suppose you have two files, 'file1.txt' and 'file2.txt', located at 'TEST/project1'. To append the content of 'file1.txt' to the end of 'file2.txt', you can execute the following command:
```
cat TEST/project1/file1.txt >> TEST/project1/file2.txt
```
This will append the content of 'file1.txt' to the end of 'file2.txt'.

4. Create Empty Files with 'touch'
The 'touch' command is primarily used to update file timestamps, but it is also handy for creating empty files. To create an empty file, simply use the 'touch' command followed by the desired filename. For example:
```
touch filename
```
This will create a new file with the specified name. In practice, users often employ 'touch' to create empty files. Here's a simple example of how it works:
```
touch ~/test
echo ""New Content"" > ~/test
echo ""More Content"" >> ~/test
```
In the above example, the first 'touch' command creates an empty file named 'test'. Then, the 'echo' command adds content to the file using the '>' and '>>' operators. The '>' operator overwrites the file content, while '>>' appends new text to the end of the file.

5. Find Your Current Directory with 'pwd'
While navigating the Linux filesystem hierarchy using the 'cd' command, it can sometimes be useful to know your current working directory. The 'pwd' command comes to the rescue by printing the name of the current directory. For example, if you are in '/var/www/html/site1', running 'pwd' will display '/var/www/html/site1'. Though you may not use 'pwd' frequently, it can be extremely helpful when you need to confirm your location within the filesystem.

By mastering these additional five Linux commands, you will greatly improve your file and folder management skills. Combine them with the previously mentioned commands, and you'll be well-equipped to navigate the Linux environment with confidence.

Remember, Linux offers countless commands, each serving a unique purpose. Exploring and familiarizing yourself with these commands over time will enhance your Linux experience and empower you to accomplish a wide range of tasks efficiently and effortlessly.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/73a6f654a7f5dd5cfc8e3389ab98f6a3dc1aafce/2024/03/25/49237a5b-9c57-4f0a-b810-21a85165bfeb/5penguinsflyinggettyimages-520459992.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.reuters.com/technology/consumers-sue-apple-taking-page-us-justice-department-lawsuit-2024-03-25/,"Consumers sue Apple, taking page from US Justice Department lawsuit","Apple Faces New Consumer Lawsuits Alleging Monopolization

Apple Inc. is now facing multiple consumer lawsuits accusing the tech giant of monopolizing the smartphone market. These lawsuits come on the heels of a recent antitrust case filed by the U.S. Justice Department and 15 states. The consumer lawsuits, which aim to represent millions of consumers, echo the government's claims that Apple violated U.S. antitrust law by suppressing technology for messaging apps, digital wallets, and other features that could have fostered competition in the smartphone market.

Apple has firmly denied these allegations, and the Cupertino-based company has yet to comment on the consumer lawsuits. However, attorney Steve Berman, representing one of the new cases filed by the law firm Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, expressed satisfaction that the Department of Justice shares their perspective on the matter. Berman's firm previously sued Apple for impeding competition for its Apple Pay mobile wallet.

While Apple is already grappling with private lawsuits challenging its business practices as anticompetitive, a judge recently ruled that the company must face a class-action lawsuit on behalf of millions of consumers who claim that Apple monopolized the market for iPhone apps. Apple adamantly denies these claims. Hagens Berman has previously secured $550 million in settlements from Apple in separate cases involving ebook pricing and app store policies.

A study conducted by a professor from the University at Buffalo Law School in 2022 found that private antitrust class actions can sometimes yield more significant outcomes than government cases, expanding the scope of wrongdoing, the amount of recovery, and the number of defendants involved.

In Conclusion

Apple's legal battles continue to mount as it faces a barrage of new consumer lawsuits alleging monopolization of the smartphone market. These lawsuits, which seek to represent millions of consumers, align with the U.S. Justice Department's claims that Apple violated antitrust laws by stifling competition in various areas of smartphone technology. While Apple maintains its innocence, it is already contending with private lawsuits challenging its business practices. The outcome of these cases could have significant implications for the future landscape of the smartphone market.",https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/B3X5LHXT4JOHTENL4XL4Y2SIFU.jpg?auth=56bc6d58f91afb22805f61cfae1df3eaa88fd2ea3354cee456cfc9b9c00a31be&width=1920&height=1005&smart=true,2024-03-25 15:10:56,Innovation,Innovation

Amazon is not just the company that delivers packages to your door. It is also one of the most innovative companies in the world, making major investments in infrastructure, supply chain, IT, and transportation. But what many people may not know is that Amazon has been incorporating AI and machine learning into its processes for a long time.

Now, Amazon is taking its expertise in AI and bringing it to classrooms and virtual learning experiences. We had the opportunity to speak with Victor Reinoso, the global director of education philanthropy at Amazon, about the future of education and AI. Reinoso, who was previously the deputy mayor of Washington D.C., is passionate about preparing young people for the careers of the future.

According to Reinoso, there is a significant gap in AI education. While teachers are eager to deliver AI content to their students, they often lack the tools and resources to do so. In fact, a survey conducted by Amazon and Access Partnership found that 70% of educators lack the resources to teach AI skills, despite 60% believing that these skills should be taught from Grade 6 through university.

To address this gap, Amazon is taking several steps. They are funding professional development for teachers, helping school districts implement sustainable STEM education initiatives. They are also increasing awareness of and access to AI tools and curriculum. For example, Amazon has launched the AI Ready commitment, which aims to provide free AI skills training to two million people by 2025. They have also collaborated with Code.org to create the Hour of Code Dance Party: AI Edition, an hour-long introduction to coding and generative AI for K-12 students and teachers.

In addition to these initiatives, Amazon is offering scholarships and courses to increase access to AI education. They are providing more than 50,000 high school and university students with scholarships to access a new generative AI course on Udacity. They are also offering eight new and free AI and generative AI courses for professionals in the workplace.

But it's not just about teaching AI skills. Responsible AI use is also a crucial part of the curriculum. Teachers recognize the importance of teaching students how to use AI responsibly, and Amazon is committed to promoting responsible AI practices. As AI continues to evolve, responsible stewards will be essential in guiding its application.

Amazon is not just a delivery company. It is a leader in innovation and is now bringing that innovation to education. By investing in AI education and providing resources and support to teachers and students, Amazon is helping to bridge the AI education gap and prepare young people for the careers of the future.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/08bc5883c45c188259ecb098a51ea114dc119601/2024/03/25/38b15b64-4b2d-45b8-8147-39fda8737c67/amazon-future-engineer-career-discovery-day-20231024-bsd-students-1010.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 10:59:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/maju-kuruvilla-is-out-as-ceo-of-one-click-checkout-company-bolt/,Maju Kuruvilla is out as CEO of one-click checkout company Bolt,"Bolt, the one-click checkout company, has undergone a leadership change. Maju Kuruvilla, the former CEO, has been replaced by Justin Grooms, who previously served as Bolt's global head of sales. Grooms has now taken on the role of interim CEO, as stated on his LinkedIn profile. Kuruvilla confirmed the change on both LinkedIn and X, simply stating, ""One-Click Checkedout from @bolt! Onwards,"" accompanied by a rocket emoji. However, he did not provide any further comments on the matter. Arjun Sethi, a co-founder of Tribe Capital, a venture firm, commented on Kuruvilla's LinkedIn post, expressing his admiration for the executive.

According to The Information, Bolt's board voted to remove Kuruvilla over the weekend. Kuruvilla, a former executive at Amazon, assumed the position of CEO in January 2022 after founder Ryan Breslow stepped down.

Grooms has been with Bolt for five years and has held executive positions at various companies, including Ultraleap (formerly Leap Motion), Datron World Communications, and Qualcomm, as indicated on his LinkedIn profile. Bolt informed The Information that the CEO role had undergone changes and described Kuruvilla's departure as ""amicable,"" but did not provide any further details.

Bolt has had its fair share of controversies. Its founder, Ryan Breslow, started the company at the age of 27 after dropping out of Stanford and was known for being outspoken. In an interview with TechCrunch, Breslow mentioned that the company had signed around 10 major deals in the second half of 2021, with each deal being larger than any previous deal in Bolt's history.

However, the company faced various challenges. Bolt was under federal investigation regarding potential violations of securities laws during its fundraising efforts in 2021. The company was seeking a Series E round of $355 million, which valued the company at $11 billion. Bolt raised approximately $1 billion in total venture-backed funding.

The company also experienced multiple rounds of layoffs, including one in May 2022 where at least 185 employees, accounting for one-third of the workforce, were let go. Subsequent layoffs occurred in early 2023 and December 2023, affecting 29% of the staff.

In October, Kuruvilla, then CEO, stated that the SEC was no longer investigating Bolt. He also mentioned that the company was working towards profitability and had plans to introduce new features, such as improving merchandise returns and offering personalized experiences through its universal shopper network. In November, Bolt announced partnerships with retailers, including Saks OFF 5TH, Shinola, Filson, Lafayette 148, and Toys ""R"" Us.

More recently, Bolt entered into a deal with Checkout.com, in which Bolt became Checkout.com's exclusive one-click checkout provider, while Checkout.com became Bolt's preferred payment partner.

However, Bolt continues to forge partnerships and work towards profitability, with recent deals signed with retailers and Checkout.com.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Headshot_Maju-Kuruvilla_CEO-of-Bolt-1.jpg?resize=1200,813",2024-03-25 21:15:07,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/elon-musk-x-ccdh-california-lawsuit-dismissed/,A judge just killed Elon Musk's lawsuit against an anti-hate research org,"A federal judge recently made a ruling against Elon Musk and his company, dismissing a lawsuit they had filed against a nonprofit organization called the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH). The lawsuit was brought forward by Musk's company, referred to as ""X"" in the text, and accused the CCDH of spreading misleading information through unflattering reports about hate and extremism on the platform.

In addition to the accusations of spreading misleading claims, Musk and X also claimed that the CCDH had illegally scraped data and violated the platform's rules by using a third-party social media monitoring tool called Brandwatch to aggregate content. Musk himself referred to the CCDH as ""an evil propaganda machine"" in replies on social media.

Last year, the CCDH filed a motion to dismiss X's claims under California's Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (SLAPP) law, which is designed to prevent frivolous lawsuits intended to intimidate. The organization also requested a judge to dismiss the lawsuit. The CEO of the CCDH, Imran Ahmed, accused Musk of intentionally prolonging the legal process to increase the organization's legal expenses. It's worth noting that Musk is known for his personal involvement in lawsuits.

On Monday, United States district judge Charles R. Breyer granted the CCDH's motion to dismiss the lawsuit. Breyer also denied Musk and X the opportunity to reopen the case. In his ruling, Breyer stated that it was clear that X had brought the case with the intention of punishing the CCDH for their critical publications and to discourage others from engaging in similar criticism.

Following Musk's increased presence on Twitter, the CCDH drew attention to the rise of hate speech on the platform. One report explored how Musk's decision to unban several highly followed extremists could potentially boost the platform's ad revenue. This included the notorious neo-Nazi Andrew Anglin, who is known for creating the white supremacist website, the Daily Stormer.

The CCDH, established in 2018, conducts research on trends related to hate speech, extremism, and misinformation on major social networks. Their research regularly highlights disturbing content found across various platforms, including reports on eating disorder content on TikTok, climate denial on YouTube, and violent misogynistic threats on Instagram.

Following the court ruling, CCDH CEO Imran Ahmed expressed his satisfaction, stating that the courts had affirmed their right to research, speak, advocate, and hold social media companies accountable for decisions that impact fundamental human rights, civil liberties, democracy, and children.

The CCDH's legal team included Roberta Kaplan, who had recently achieved a major victory in the E. Jean Carroll defamation suit against former President Donald Trump. Kaplan commented on Monday's ruling, emphasizing that even the world's wealthiest man cannot manipulate the rule of law to his advantage.

While the CCDH celebrated their victory in California, Musk is pursuing a similar lawsuit against the left-leaning media watchdog Media Matters for America. However, this lawsuit is taking place in Texas, where the same protections against frivolous lawsuits, aimed at suppressing free speech, do not exist as they do in California.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/twitter-x-logo-musk-pattern.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-25 20:33:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/03/25/a-psychologist-explores-3-silver-linings-of-parentification-of-kids/,A Psychologist Explores 3 Silver Linings Of ‘Parentified’ Kids,"A child that grew up too quickly can flourish in surprising ways.

Imagine Emma, a 16-year old who lives with her parents and two younger brothers. Her parents work long hours and can’t afford a babysitter. They ask Emma to take care of her brothers after school and get some chores done before they get back from work. She has to make lunch, get them fed, supervise their homework, do the laundry, and make dinner. Her parents sometimes include her in arguments about their finances and ask her who is in the right.

If you’ve felt like you carried the emotional or manual burden of your house as a child, then you’ve shared Emma’s childhood experience of “parentification.”

Disturbed family dynamics, working parents, or illness in the family can lead to the parentification of children. This phenomenon occurs when children provide caregiving for family members that typically exceeds their capacity and developmental stage. Taking on these responsibilities can have detrimental outcomes, including distress and a loss of the innocence and sense of wonderment of childhood.

However, parentification can yield unexpected benefits for the parentified child. A study concluded that perceived fairness, appreciation and validation, a positive relationship with parents, and community support paved the way for thriving outcomes. For example, children that believe they have been assigned responsibilities fairly, get validation from their parents, and share supportive relationships with their siblings and grandparents might be able to make it out of a parentified childhood relatively unscathed.

Here are three positive outcomes that can be experienced by parentified children in supportive environments.

1. A Wide And Solid Social Circle

Due to circumstances beyond their control, parentified children speed through childhood, shouldering responsibilities that overwhelm their capacity. Yet, these children can cultivate healthy relationships with their parents while bearing their household duties and emotional needs. A study found that African American youth improved their relationship with their parents as a result of meeting the emotional needs of the family.

The support network offered to the children can contribute significantly to the establishment of positive relationships. Another study found that siblings’ relationships improved with consistent social support. Strengthened sibling bonds facilitated the development of empathy, understanding, acceptance for others, emotional connections, and a heightened proclivity toward social support.

Parentification is an unfortunate reality for many households, but that does not mean that the child has to suffer in isolation. Social support from extended family and one’s immediate neighborhood can mitigate the negative side-effects of parentification while also giving children the opportunity to be “raised by the village.”

2. Extraordinary Resilience And Sense Of Responsibility

Amidst the caregiver roles taken on by parentified children, they develop resilience as they navigate challenges typically reserved for adults. A study concluded that college students experiencing parentification scored high on resilience. Parentification can help children learn adaptability and maintain composure under duress.

Simultaneously, parentification can equip children with a heightened sense of responsibility. They become adept at managing household tasks, caring for siblings, and providing emotional support to family members. Despite the challenges posed by assuming adult roles prematurely, they emerge with a profound understanding of accountability and a strong work ethic, which can serve as a foundation for future success.

3. Elevated Self-Esteem and Self-Efficacy

Parentification can engender a positive view of self as children perform parental responsibilities successfully. A study found that parentified children exhibited higher levels of self-esteem when they perceived greater benefits of parentification and enjoyed positive relationships with their siblings. Children identified the benefits as deriving enjoyment from their role, feeling appreciated, and sensing that their family functioned effectively as a team. Thus, for parentified children, receiving gratitude from their family members seems to boost their confidence and sense of worth.

Additionally, children seem to build their self-esteem through identification with the role assigned to them, carrying out the responsibilities, and experiencing a sense of self-approval. In a supportive family environment, children actively embrace the roles assigned to them to maintain attachments with their typically busy parents. The identification and subsequent benefits gained from parentification can be seen as an adaptive defense mechanism.

The “adult-like” duties carried out by children create feelings of competence and foster their sense of self-worth. While parentification is not an ideal situation for any child, it is important to recognize that some children can thrive and develop important life skills as a result of their experiences. With the right support and nurturing environment, parentified children can overcome the challenges they face and grow into resilient, responsible, and confident individuals.

In conclusion, parentification can have both negative and positive outcomes for children. While it is important to address the underlying issues that lead to parentification and provide support to children in these situations, it is also essential to recognize the potential for growth and development that can arise from these experiences. By acknowledging the strengths and resilience of parentified children, we can create a more compassionate and understanding society that supports and empowers them to flourish despite their challenging circumstances.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6601106cc11f7d8efb9a0826/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1483,695,x0,y169,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 14:26:02,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-favorite-linux-text-editors-and-why-you-should-be-using-one/,My favorite Linux text editors (and why you should be using one),"Linux has a long history of text editors, with the infamous editor wars between emacs and vi dividing users into loyal camps. However, the role of text editors has evolved over time. While they were once primarily used for configuring Linux systems or writing code, they now serve a much broader range of purposes. Today, text editors can be used for note-taking, journaling, and even writing novels. Although I haven't personally written a full-length book using a text editor, I have used them extensively for short stories and flash fiction.

In this article, I will introduce you to some of the best text editors available for Linux. However, I must apologize in advance to those who are die-hard fans of either vi or Emacs, as they will not be included on this list. While both of these editors are undeniably powerful, I have always found them to be more of a hindrance than a help. They are not designed for everyday use or for the average user, which is the focus of this article. That being said, if you find the editors listed here too simple or not flexible enough, you can always turn to Emacs or vi for their extensive coding, configuring, and administering capabilities.

Now, let's dive into the text editors that are perfect for those who appreciate tools that are easier to use, yet still highly effective.

1. Nano
Nano has been my go-to text editor for decades. It may be basic, but it gets the job done. Nano includes all the essential features I need in an editor without overwhelming me with unnecessary extras. With Nano, you can write simple flat text files, which means they have no formatting. It offers interactive search-and-replace, undo/redo functionality, syntax coloring, smooth scrolling, auto-indentation, go-to-line-and-column-number, feature toggles, file locking, and internationalization support.

One thing to note about Nano is that it is a terminal application, so it doesn't have a graphical user interface. To use Nano, simply open the terminal and issue the command ""nano filename"" (replace ""filename"" with the name of the file you want to edit or create). Nano also provides various options that you can use, such as ""--backup"" to create a backup of the previous version of the file, ""--tabstospaces"" to convert typed tabs to spaces, ""--locking"" to lock the file when editing, ""--smooth"" for smooth scrolling, and many more.

Nano is free and comes pre-installed with most Linux distributions.

2. Gedit
Gedit is the default text editor for the GNOME desktop environment. It is a basic yet effective graphical application. Gedit offers features like tabs, support for internationalized text (UTF-8), syntax highlighting, markdown support, configurable fonts and colors, print support, auto-save, auto backup creation, keyboard shortcuts, theming, full-screen mode, and more.

What sells me on Gedit is its simplicity. Although I usually default to Nano, when I need a graphical interface, Gedit is my choice. One of the main reasons I keep Gedit around is that Nano needs to be opened from the terminal window, which means clicking on a link to a text file doesn't work as expected. In such cases, Gedit comes to the rescue. Another reason why I sometimes opt for Gedit is its fullscreen mode, which allows me to edit a text file without any distractions.

Gedit is free and comes pre-installed with most Linux distributions based on the GNOME desktop.

3. COSMIC Text Editor
COSMIC Text Editor will be the default text editor for System76's COSMIC desktop once it's released. However, even in its current state, COSMIC Text Editor is already showing great progress and promises to be the Gedit equivalent for COSMIC. It offers a fairly typical feature set, including syntax highlighting, standard keyboard shortcuts, find functionality, spellcheck, project support, revert changes, document statistics, and even Git management support.

What sets COSMIC Text Editor apart is its dark theme, which I find particularly appealing. Like Gedit, COSMIC Text Editor is very simple to use and can handle both basic and more complex tasks, such as writing code. If you're using Pop!_OS, you can get a preview of what COSMIC Text Editor will look and feel like by installing it from the Pop Shop.

COSMIC Text Editor is free and will be officially available when the COSMIC Desktop OS is released.

4. Kate
Kate is the text editor for the KDE Plasma desktop environment, similar to how Gedit is for GNOME. The main difference between the two is that Kate offers a few additional features, such as multi-cursor and multi-cursor selection. These features allow you to select and manipulate multiple strings of text simultaneously. Kate also provides project support, syntax highlighting, standard keyboard shortcuts, and plugin support. With plugins, you can add features like SQL query support, GDB debugging, one-click project build, and more. Think of Kate as a supercharged version of Gedit that is suitable for creating and editing simple text files as well.

Kate is free and comes pre-installed with most Linux distributions based on the KDE Plasma desktop.

In conclusion, text editors have come a long way since the days of the editor wars between emacs and vi.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-method-quantum-mechanics-lithium-metal.html,New method that uses quantum mechanics can lead to improved lithium metal batteries,"In a groundbreaking study published in Nature Energy, Dr. Perla Balbuena and Dr. Jorge Seminario from Texas A&M University have devised a new approach to understanding how external pressure affects lithium-metal batteries using quantum mechanics. By gaining a deeper understanding of the behavior of lithium ions under pressure, this research has the potential to revolutionize lithium-metal battery fabrication processes, leading to longer-lasting and more efficient battery technologies.

The impact of this research extends beyond the field of chemical engineering. According to Dr. Balbuena, the methods used in this study can be applied to various disciplines, including chemical engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, materials science, and biology. This work demonstrates the power of first-principles ab initio analysis in shaping macroscopic processes.

This research is part of the ongoing Battery500 Consortium, a collaboration among national labs and academia aimed at developing more reliable and high-performing batteries for vehicles. Led by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, this consortium seeks to achieve the goals set by the Department of Energy.

Lithium-ion batteries have transformed the world of mobile electronics, enabling the development of compact devices that can easily fit in our pockets. However, these batteries still face several challenges, with one of the most significant being their limited energy density. The energy density of lithium-ion batteries is constrained by their components.

Dr. Seminario explains that lithium-ion batteries function by converting lithium ions into neutral species at the anode (negative electrode), storing their energy as chemical energy. These neutral species are then transformed back into ions at the cathode (positive electrode), allowing the transport of energy as electrical energy. During discharge, lithium ions migrate from the anode to the cathode, energizing the external devices they power.

To overcome the limitations of current lithium-ion batteries, researchers are exploring alternative materials. One promising avenue is replacing the graphite anode with lithium metal, which could potentially enhance energy density by a factor of ten. However, the reactivity of lithium metal necessitates innovative control measures, such as applying external pressure to the battery.

While the effect of external pressure on cell performance is well-known, there is a lack of research exploring the relationship between external pressure and the electroplating of lithium in large-format pouch cells. Additionally, when the battery undergoes cycling, its components may experience volume changes, leading to cell swelling and affecting battery performance and cycle life.

The research conducted by the Texas A&M team aimed to understand why pressure can lead to a more uniform distribution of lithium ions on the anode, preventing the formation of dendrites that could potentially short-circuit the battery. By utilizing theoretical-computational techniques, the researchers meticulously analyzed the precise effects of pressure on lithium-metal anodes.

Through their analysis, the team discovered that lithium ions have a preference for detouring towards regions with elevated pressure or a higher concentration of lithium atoms on the surface. This behavior arises due to the electric field generated by the lithium-metal anode.

This groundbreaking finding allows researchers to predict the behavior of novel materials proposed for cutting-edge applications. By understanding the behavior of ions under these conditions, it becomes possible to develop lithium-metal batteries with longer battery life and increased functionality, using less expensive infrastructure and fabrication processes.

The implications of this research are far-reaching, with potential applications in various fields beyond battery technology. The ability to manipulate the behavior of ions opens up new possibilities for advancements in chemical engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, materials science, and biology.

In conclusion, the research conducted by Dr. Perla Balbuena and Dr. Jorge Seminario provides valuable insights into the impact of external pressure on lithium-metal batteries. By employing quantum mechanics and computational techniques, the team has laid the foundation for developing longer-lasting and more efficient battery technologies. This research has the potential to revolutionize the field of battery technology and pave the way for advancements in various disciplines.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/new-discovery-can-lead.jpg,2024-03-25 17:06:08,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/gostudent-tutoring-profitability/,"GoStudent, the online learning platform, says it's now profitable","GoStudent, the Vienna-based online tutoring marketplace, has become one of Austria's most successful and profitable startups. With a valuation of $3.2 billion, GoStudent boasts 11 million families and 23,000 tutors on its platform. CEO Felix Ohswald recently revealed that the company is not only EBITDA profitable but also has positive operating cash flow. This achievement sets GoStudent apart from other Austrian startups in the international tech scene.

However, GoStudent's journey to profitability has not been without challenges. Like many other technology companies, it faced a market crash during the online learning boom caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Customer demand sharply declined, resulting in significant losses for GoStudent. In 2021, the company lost €89 million, which increased to €220 million in 2022. As a result, GoStudent had to implement cost-cutting measures and layoffs.

GoStudent experienced rapid growth during this period, scaling its revenue to over €100 million from 2019 to 2022. However, the company also had a cash burn of over €150 million in 2022 alone. Realizing that this path was unsustainable, GoStudent made the necessary changes to reduce its burn rate by 70% in 2023. Despite raising substantial funding, the company knew it had to find a more sustainable approach to growth.

The COVID-19 pandemic brought about a digital transformation in education, benefiting edtech companies like GoStudent. The company went from having to convince parents about the benefits of online tutoring to becoming the go-to solution for students needing educational assistance. However, despite this demand, GoStudent still had to address its cash burn issue.

To cut costs, GoStudent made several changes. It stopped hosting lavish parties, paused acquisitions, and refrained from expanding into markets where online tutoring was not established or where it had to lower prices significantly to compete. The company also decided to exit the highly competitive U.S. market after a short-lived entry. GoStudent now focuses on Europe and adopts a more organic growth strategy. Its former chief growth officer was replaced by a chief marketing officer, signaling a shift from top-line to bottom-line growth.

As GoStudent pursues its goal of becoming the leading global school and unlocking the potential of every student through personalized tutoring, it faces the challenge of balancing growth with cost-efficiency. While it currently operates as a tutoring platform, GoStudent's acquisition of Studienkreis in 2022 hints at its evolution into a more comprehensive educational provider. Studienkreis, with its physical learning centers, allows GoStudent to explore hybrid learning opportunities.

CEO Felix Ohswald believes that the future of education is hybrid and ""glocal."" While education curricula are typically national or regional, GoStudent aims to use technology to connect students with the right tutors regardless of location. Most of GoStudent's tutors are university students, making it easier for them to connect with pupils while providing personalized tutoring.

In conclusion, GoStudent's journey to profitability is a testament to its resilience and adaptability. By addressing its cash burn issue and focusing on sustainable growth, the company has emerged as one of Austria's most successful startups. With its focus on personalized tutoring and hybrid learning, GoStudent is well-positioned to continue making a significant impact in the education industry.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Founders-of-GoStudent-Gregor-Muller-I-Felix-Ohswald-2.jpg?w=1024,2024-03-25 11:00:36,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-high-efficiency-based-copperiodide-clusters.html,A high efficiency LED based on copper-iodide clusters,"A team of researchers led by Prof. Yao Hongbin from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) has made a significant breakthrough in the development of warm white light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Their work, published in Nature Photonics, details the creation of a high efficiency and high brightness LED based on copper-iodide cluster hybrids.

Solution-processed LEDs have long been recognized as the technology that will pave the way for the next generation of large-area solid-state lighting. Their simple manufacturing process and high operability make them ideal for widespread adoption. Currently, solution-processed LED devices based on lead-halide perovskites, organic semiconductor materials, and colloidal core-shell quantum dots (QDs) have shown impressive electroluminescence performance.

However, the use of materials containing heavy metals like lead-halide perovskites and CdSe QDs raises serious environmental concerns. On the other hand, LED devices based on organic light-emitting molecules, InP QDs, and ZnSe QDs are expensive to produce due to complex synthesis methods. Therefore, the key challenge for future solid-state lighting lies in developing solution-processed LEDs that are low-cost, low-toxicity, easily scalable, and highly efficient.

To address this challenge, Prof. Yao's team focused on designing and preparing a copper-iodine-based hybrid cluster with a broad photoluminescence spectrum. They achieved this by introducing nitrogen-phosphine chelating ligands and phosphine-containing solubilizing ligands, resulting in copper-iodide hybrid clusters with both high luminescence efficiency and high solubility. These clusters exhibited a solubility of more than 200 mg/mL and good structural stability in N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF), the cross-solvent used in LED production.

The team then fabricated luminescent thin films using spin-coating in DMF, which displayed a low surface roughness of 0.22 nm and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of over 70%. These films served as the luminescent layer for the creation of low-cost warm-white LED devices through an orthogonal solvent route. The resulting LED devices achieved impressive performance, with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 19.1%, a brightness exceeding 40,000 cd m-2, and an operational lifetime of more than 232 hours (T 50 @100 cd m-2). The team also successfully constructed a large-area solution-processed LED device with a working area of 36 cm2 through blade-coating, demonstrating warm white light emission with a brightness close to 60,000 cd m-2.

Furthermore, by modifying different electron-donating groups on the nitrogen heterocycles of the nitrogen-phosphine chelating ligands, the team developed a series of solution-processed color-tunable LED devices.

This groundbreaking work has resulted in LED devices that boast both high efficiency and high brightness, all thanks to the unique properties of copper-iodide hybrid clusters. The expandability and spectral tunability of these clusters make them highly promising for the fabrication of low-cost, high-performance LED panels and solid-state lighting.

In conclusion, Prof. Yao Hongbin's team at USTC has made significant strides in the development of warm white LEDs. By utilizing copper-iodide hybrid clusters, they have created solution-processed LED devices that offer high efficiency, high brightness, and low cost. These advancements bring us one step closer to the widespread adoption of solid-state lighting, making it a more accessible and sustainable option for the future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/ustc-designs-high-effi.jpg,2024-03-25 13:17:52,Innovation,Innovation
