Here's the good, the bad, and the ugly","DevOps engineering is a highly sought-after profession in today's job market. However, to excel in this role, one must have a strong background in technology development and business acumen. Moreover, continuous learning is essential to stay relevant in a field where popular approaches quickly become obsolete.

The demand for DevOps engineers, who are responsible for automating and coordinating cloud and on-premises environments to ensure seamless software development and deployment, is on the rise. These professionals are well-compensated, with an average salary of around $134,000 per year in the US, according to estimates from Talent.com.

But what does it take to thrive in this role? Experienced DevOps engineer Brad Morgan sheds some light on the necessary skills. Firstly, a solid understanding of Linux is crucial. Regardless of the specific tasks involved in a DevOps role, Linux knowledge is fundamental. Familiarity with the basics, command line usage, and terminal commands are a must.

Another essential skill is bash scripting, which automates Linux commands. DevOps engineers frequently utilize bash scripting in building pipelines and streamlining processes. Thus, gaining proficiency in this area is highly beneficial.

Cloud skills are also of utmost importance. Morgan suggests focusing on mastering one mainstream cloud provider, such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure, rather than trying to become an expert in all of them. In-depth knowledge of one platform makes it easier to adapt to others in the future.

Becoming a DevOps engineer does not require following a specific formal course. Self-learning and continuous improvement are key. Morgan emphasizes the importance of constant learning, enjoying the process, and challenging oneself. DevOps engineering is an ever-evolving field, with tools and frameworks constantly changing. Therefore, dedicating personal time to studying is essential for professional growth.

Homebrew Henry, another experienced DevOps engineer, echoes this sentiment. He emphasizes the need to embrace continuous learning and adaptability. The DevOps ecosystem is vast and constantly evolving, with new tools and frameworks emerging regularly. As a DevOps engineer, one must be prepared to invest time and effort into staying up to date with the latest trends and technologies.

Even with experience, learning never stops in this field. In fact, many DevOps engineers find the constant learning aspect to be one of the most enjoyable aspects of their job. With the rapid pace of development and the introduction of AI tools like ChatGPT, the field of DevOps engineering will continue to evolve.

Passionate DevOps engineers often find fulfillment in managing infrastructure. However, Homebrew Henry cautions that those who are not fond of infrastructure management may struggle in this role. DevOps engineers spend a significant amount of time setting up, configuring, and maintaining cloud infrastructure. Dealing with servers, databases, networks, and security is a daily task. While some engineers find this exciting, others may prefer the realm of software engineering and building customer-facing applications.

Fortunately, transitioning between software engineering and DevOps is possible. Many professionals have successfully made the switch, so it is not a career path that locks you into a specific role forever.

Lastly, it is crucial to consider the business aspect of DevOps. Unrealistic expectations often surround the role, with businesses hoping that hiring a few engineers will magically solve all their problems. Management may overlook the fact that DevOps requires continuous learning, adaptation, and meticulous attention to detail.

In conclusion, DevOps engineering is an exciting and in-demand field that requires a combination of technical expertise, continuous learning, and adaptability. With the right skills and commitment to personal growth, one can thrive in this profession. Whether it's mastering Linux, bash scripting, or cloud platforms, or staying abreast of the latest developments, DevOps engineers must be prepared to embrace change and tackle new challenges head-on.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/e4d3d8d263eb00323161fcf2566ad35a3fe52282/2024/03/25/1b8b924e-2629-43c2-b416-1b990e262786/gettyimages-1319039490.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-liquid-iron-battery-grid-energy.html,New all-liquid iron flow battery for grid energy storage,"A New Battery Design: Repurposing a Common Chemical for Large-Scale Energy Storage

Researchers at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have developed a new battery design that repurposes a commonplace chemical used in water treatment facilities. This design offers a pathway to a safe, economical, and water-based flow battery made with Earth-abundant materials. It presents an exciting opportunity to incorporate intermittent energy sources like wind and solar energy into the nation's electric grid.

The researchers, as reported in Nature Communications, conducted tests on their lab-scale, iron-based battery and found that it exhibited remarkable cycling stability over one thousand consecutive charging cycles. Even after these cycles, the battery maintained an impressive 98.7% of its maximum capacity. In comparison, previous studies on similar iron-based batteries reported degradation of the charge capacity that was two orders of magnitude higher, and that too, over fewer charging cycles.

Iron-based flow batteries designed for large-scale energy storage have been in existence since the 1980s, and some are already commercially available. However, what sets this new battery apart is its unique liquid chemical formula for energy storage. This formula combines charged iron with a neutral-pH phosphate-based liquid electrolyte, or energy carrier. The crucial element of this design is the chemical called nitrogenous triphosphonate, nitrilotri-methylphosphonic acid or NTMPA. What makes this chemical special is that it is commercially available in industrial quantities due to its typical use in inhibiting corrosion in water treatment plants.

NTMPA falls under the category of phosphonates, which are a broad chemical family based on the element phosphorus. Many phosphonates, including NTMPA, dissolve well in water and are non-toxic. They find applications in fertilizers, detergents, and several other industries.

The development of new flow battery technologies is essential to modernize the U.S. electric grid and provide a means to store energy from renewable sources like wind and solar power. This is where flow batteries come in. Flow batteries consist of two chambers, each filled with a different liquid. They charge through an electrochemical reaction and store energy in chemical bonds. When connected to an external circuit, they release the stored energy, which can power electrical devices.

Unlike conventional batteries, flow batteries feature two external supply tanks of liquid that constantly circulate through them to supply the electrolyte, serving as the battery system's ""blood supply."" The size of the electrolyte supply tank determines the amount of energy the flow battery can store.

The new aqueous iron (Fe) redox flow battery captures energy from renewable sources in the form of electrons and stores it by changing the charge of iron in the flowing liquid electrolyte. When the stored energy is needed, the iron can release the charge to supply energy to the electric grid. Flow batteries can serve as backup generators for the electric grid and are a crucial component of decarbonization strategies that aim to store energy from renewable resources. The advantage of flow batteries is that they can be built at any scale, from lab-bench size to the size of a city block.

In the short term, grid operators are eager to install battery energy storage systems (BESS) in urban or suburban areas near energy consumers. However, safety concerns often arise in such cases. The type of aqueous flow battery developed by the researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory could help address these concerns.

""A BESS facility using the chemistry similar to what we have developed here would have the advantage of operating in water at neutral pH,"" said Aaron Hollas, a study author and team leader in PNNL's Battery Materials and Systems Group. ""In addition, our system uses commercially available reagents that haven't been previously investigated for use in flow batteries.""

The research team reported that their initial design can reach an energy density of up to 9 watt-hours per liter (Wh/L). While commercialized vanadium-based systems are more than twice as energy dense, at 25 Wh/L, it's important to note that higher energy density batteries can store more energy in a smaller space. However, a system built with Earth-abundant materials, like the one developed by the researchers, can be scaled up to provide the same energy output.

The future development of flow batteries holds immense potential for revolutionizing energy storage and enabling the integration of renewable energy sources into the electric grid. With further advancements and optimizations, flow batteries could become a key player in the transition to a sustainable and clean energy future.

https://www.reuters.com/technology/outflows-grayscale-bitcoin-etf-hit-19-billion-single-week-2024-03-25/,Outflows from Grayscale bitcoin ETF hit $1.9 billion in single week,"Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, a leading cryptocurrency investment firm, experienced $1.9 billion in outflows last week, resulting in net outflows for U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the week ending March 22. This data, provided by BitMEX Research, reveals that despite the approval of new cryptocurrency ETFs by the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission in January, buying interest from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity Investments was not enough to counterbalance the selling by Grayscale holders.

Additionally, inflows to the nine other ETFs launched simultaneously with Grayscale's fund also slowed down last week due to the relatively stable price of bitcoin compared to its earlier highs this month. Analysts attribute Grayscale's outflows to its significantly higher fees compared to its competitors, as well as selling by bankruptcy trustees.

Morningstar ETF analyst Bryan Armour explains that Grayscale chose to maintain a 1.5% management fee on its converted ETF, whereas BlackRock's fund charges only 0.25%, and even lower fees, including fee waivers, are offered by other rivals. Grayscale's spokesperson stated that the team anticipated net outflows due to profit-taking and arbitrage strategies, as well as selling by bankruptcy trustees to satisfy creditors of FTX and other entities. Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein mentioned that the firm plans to reduce fees on its flagship fund gradually.

In contrast, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust has experienced significant growth, reaching $10 billion in assets on March 1, according to Morningstar and TrackInsight data. Although inflows for the week ending March 15 amounted to $2.48 billion, last week saw a decline to $828.3 million, as shown by BitMEX Research.

Grayscale faces further challenges as Wealthfront, a digital wealth management provider, recently announced its decision to replace Grayscale's ETF with the iShares fund due to the latter's lower fees and higher average daily trading volumes. Alex Michalka, Vice President of Investment Research at Wealthfront, stated that considering the overall cost of expense ratio and bid-ask spread, the iShares Bitcoin Trust was deemed more attractive.

Bitcoin, which surged by as much as 16% earlier this year, is currently around 9% below its peak achieved just two weeks ago. The performance of ETFs mirrors this price action. Adam Sze, Head of Digital Assets Product for ETF provider Global X, suggests that when an asset reaches all-time highs, profit-taking or a slowdown in buying tends to occur.

Reviving bitcoin ETF flows may depend not only on a more stable price but also on increased interest from institutional investors. Kyle Da Cruz, Director of Digital Assets Product at VanEck, which has its own bitcoin ETF competing for a share of the limited inflows, explains that most of the trading activity in this nascent asset class has been dominated by individual investors and a few hedge funds. The entry of ""stickier"" money from institutional investors has yet to occur.

In conclusion, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust experienced significant outflows last week, resulting in net outflows for U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs. Despite the approval of new cryptocurrency ETFs and buying interest from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity Investments, Grayscale's high fees and selling by bankruptcy trustees contributed to these outflows. In contrast, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust has seen impressive growth. To attract more investors, bitcoin ETFs may require a more stable price and increased participation from institutional investors.",https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Y426IZ7SCRJ43DETS3VROSJOS4.jpg?auth=a05255c728626cf01249eeabc56e6ceb25b746829c46995fa3b47540f2392761&width=1920&height=1005&smart=true,2024-03-25 17:36:34,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/boeing-ceo-to-leave-company-by-year-end-after-a-wave-of-safety-incidents/,Boeing CEO to leave company by year-end after a wave of safety incidents,"Boeing, the renowned plane-maker, is facing a significant shakeup as its CEO, Dave Calhoun, is set to leave the company by the end of 2024. This decision comes in the wake of a series of safety incidents that have plagued the company in recent times. One such incident involved a cabin panel blowout on one of Boeing's planes, which raised serious concerns about the safety of their aircraft.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobinglis/2024/03/25/avoiding-the-judgment-of-history/,Avoiding The Judgment Of History,"Art Laffer, a former economics advisor to President Ronald Reagan, recently had a meeting with former President Trump to discuss the possibility of replacing Jerome Powell as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Laffer has also expressed support for a revenue-neutral carbon tax as an effective market-based solution to address climate change.

In Australia, Kim Beazley, the former ambassador to the US, takes a strong stance against climate skeptics. He wants his children and grandchildren to know where he stands on climate change and hopes others will do the same.

Recently, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a non-binding resolution condemning a carbon tax, despite the fact that carbon pricing is considered the most powerful means of combating climate change. The resolution was introduced by Rep. Ryan Zinke and had previously been offered by Rep. Steve Scalise.

However, those who oppose a carbon tax seem to overlook two important aspects of its design. Firstly, a well-designed carbon tax can be made revenue-neutral by pairing it with a reduction in an existing tax, ensuring that there is no growth in government. Secondly, it can be made border-adjustable by applying the tax to imports from countries that have not yet implemented a carbon tax.

Interestingly, during the same week that the carbon tax resolution passed in the House, reports emerged that Art Laffer had met with Donald Trump to discuss the possibility of replacing Jerome Powell as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. There were also discussions about Kevin Hassett being considered for the position. Both Laffer and Hassett have advocated for addressing climate change through a carbon tax, coupled with a dollar-for-dollar reduction in existing taxes.

Laffer and Hassett are familiar with the work of Arthur Cecil Pigou, an English economist who lived from 1877 to 1959. They are both members of the Pigou Club, founded by Harvard economist Greg Mankiw, who served as George W. Bush's Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.

Pigou famously suggested that we should tax things we want less of and untax things we want more of. In this case, we want more income and less pollution. Those who voted for the carbon tax resolution should be asked why they have a problem with such a tax swap. Concerns about the impact of a carbon tax on low-wage workers can be addressed by reducing taxes on payroll income and taxing carbon pollution instead. This would specifically tackle the regressive nature of a standalone carbon tax, while also strengthening Social Security through a broadening of its tax base.

The drafters of the carbon tax resolution also seem unaware that existing World Trade Organization rules allow for the application of a carbon tax to imports from countries without a carbon tax. This is known as a border adjustment. Other countries would quickly realize that it is not in their interest to pay carbon tax revenue to America when they could collect it for themselves. They would follow America's lead and impose carbon pollution fees in their own countries. This would result in greener, cleaner products being cheaper than dirty ones, as the true cost of burning fossil fuels would be incorporated into the price.

This approach would make Pigou proud, as he believed that negative externalities caused market distortions and hindered innovation. If a company can get away with polluting the environment, it can offer its products at a lower price than a competitor who has invested in cleaner processes. While some may argue for regulation, Dr. Milton Friedman, one of President Reagan's economic advisers, suggested taxing such companies, as seen in a clip from the Phil Donahue Show in the 1980s.

Ultimately, history will judge those who oppose climate change action, and it is not just Republicans who are at risk. There were Democrats who prioritized politics over policy when voting for the carbon tax resolution. The good news is that the resolution was non-binding, and mistakes can be rectified. Redemption is always possible.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6601d28de733bba2fcac676c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 15:47:48,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/fisker-trading-suspended-by-nyse/,Fisker trading suspended by NYSE,"The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has announced that it will suspend trading of electric vehicle (EV) startup Fisker's shares and is working to remove the company from its stock exchange. The NYSE stated that Fisker's stock is no longer suitable for listing due to its abnormally low price levels. This decision comes after the NYSE warned Fisker last month that its stock price had been trading below $1 for 30 consecutive days, violating the exchange's rules.

Fisker has the opportunity to review the NYSE's determination, but the company expects its stock to be moved to an over-the-counter market, such as OTC Pink. Additionally, Fisker stated in a filing that the delisting has triggered repayment clauses in two loans that it currently cannot afford to repay. This could have a significant negative impact on the business.

This announcement follows a challenging day for Fisker, as its shares fell over 28% before trading was halted. Earlier in the day, Fisker revealed that it had lost a potential deal with a major automaker, reportedly Nissan. This development has also put at risk a recently announced attempt to secure emergency funding.

Fisker did not provide an explanation for why the negotiations with the automaker were terminated, despite it being a critical closing condition for a potential $150 million convertible note. In the filing, Fisker stated that it will request the unnamed investor to waive this closing condition.

Fisker has been facing increasing problems over the past few months, including customer complaints, lawsuits, and federal investigations. The struggling EV startup has struggled to sell its Ocean SUV, falling short of its own sales goals. In an attempt to boost sales, Fisker shifted from a direct sales model to working with dealerships. However, the company has also faced quality issues that it has struggled to resolve, according to internal documents.

In February, Fisker laid off around 200 employees, representing 15% of its staff. The company also recently reported having only $121 million in cash reserves. Fisker has halted production and warned investors that it will not survive another year without a significant cash infusion.

It is important to note that this story has been updated to include details from Fisker's SEC filing on Monday afternoon. The filing further highlights the challenges and uncertainties that Fisker is currently facing.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fisker-GettyImages.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-25 21:06:18,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/elon-musk-x-ccdh-california-lawsuit-dismissed/,A judge just killed Elon Musk's lawsuit against an anti-hate research org,"Federal Judge Dismisses Elon Musk and X's Lawsuit Against Nonprofit Researching Online Hate

In a recent ruling, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit brought by Elon Musk and X against the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), a nonprofit organization that conducts research on online hate. X had sued CCDH, accusing them of spreading misleading information through unflattering reports about hate and extremism on the platform. The lawsuit claimed that X suffered significant financial losses due to CCDH's research.

Musk and X also alleged that CCDH illegally scraped data and violated the platform's rules by aggregating content using a third-party social media monitoring tool called Brandwatch. Musk, who personally directed the lawsuit, went as far as calling CCDH ""an evil propaganda machine"" in his replies on X.

Last year, CCDH filed a motion to dismiss X's claims, citing California's law against Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (SLAPP), which aims to prevent frivolous lawsuits intended to intimidate. CCDH CEO Imran Ahmed accused Musk, who is worth approximately $200 billion, of deliberately prolonging the legal process to increase the organization's legal costs.

United States District Judge Charles R. Breyer of the Northern District of California granted CCDH's motion to dismiss the lawsuit and denied Musk and X the opportunity to re-litigate the case. In his ruling, Judge Breyer stated that it was evident that X filed the lawsuit to punish CCDH for criticizing their publications and potentially discourage others from engaging in similar criticisms.

Following Musk's increased activity on Twitter, CCDH drew attention to the rise of hate speech on the platform. They published a report that analyzed how Musk's decision to unban several highly followed extremists could benefit the company financially. This included the infamous neo-Nazi Andrew Anglin, who created the white supremacist website, the Daily Stormer.

Formed in 2018, CCDH is a nonprofit organization that researches trends in hate speech, extremism, and misinformation on major social networks. Their research regularly exposes disturbing content across various platforms, such as reports on eating disorder content on TikTok, climate denial on YouTube, and violent misogynistic threats on Instagram.

""We create costs for lies and hate,"" said Ahmed in response to the ruling. ""The courts have affirmed our fundamental right to research, speak, advocate, and hold social media companies accountable for decisions that impact our children, democracy, and fundamental human rights and civil liberties.""

The legal team representing CCDH included Roberta Kaplan, who recently achieved a significant victory in the E. Jean Carroll defamation suit against former President Donald Trump. Kaplan praised the recent decision, stating that it demonstrates that even the wealthiest individuals cannot manipulate the rule of law to their advantage.

While CCDH celebrates its victory in California, Musk is pursuing a similar lawsuit against the left-leaning media watchdog, Media Matters for America. However, unlike the CCDH lawsuit, X is suing Media Matters for America in Texas, where the same protections against frivolous lawsuits that stifle free speech do not exist.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/twitter-x-logo-musk-pattern.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-25 20:33:17,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-favorite-linux-text-editors-and-why-you-should-be-using-one/,My favorite Linux text editors (and why you should be using one),"Linux has a long history of text editors, dating back to the infamous editor wars between emacs and vi. However, the role of text editors has evolved over time. While they were once primarily used for configuring Linux or writing code, they can now serve multiple purposes, such as note-taking, journaling, and even writing novels.

In this blog post, we will explore some popular text editors for Linux that are not only powerful but also user-friendly. We will focus on editors that are suitable for everyday use by the average user.

First up is nano, a basic yet effective text editor that has been a favorite for many Linux users for decades. Nano provides all the essential features you need in an editor without overwhelming you with unnecessary complexities. It allows you to write simple flat text files without any formatting. Some of its features include interactive search-and-replace, undo/redo, syntax coloring, smooth scrolling, auto-indentation, go-to-line-and-column-number, feature toggles, file locking, and internationalization support. Nano is a terminal application, so you need to open the terminal and issue the command nano filename to edit or create a file. It comes pre-installed with most Linux distributions and is free to use.

Next on our list is Gedit, the default text editor for the GNOME desktop. Gedit is a basic GUI application that offers a clean and simple interface. It supports features like tabs, internationalized text (UTF-8), syntax highlighting, markdown support, configurable fonts and colors, printing, auto-save, auto backup, keyboard shortcuts, theming, and full-screen mode. Gedit's simplicity and ease of use make it a popular choice for users who prefer a graphical interface. It also allows you to edit text files without distraction by using the fullscreen mode. Gedit is free and comes pre-installed with most GNOME-based desktop distributions.

If you're looking for a text editor that is specifically designed for System76's COSMIC desktop, COSMIC Text Editor is the perfect choice. Although it is not officially released yet, it is already showing great progress. It aims to be the equivalent of Gedit for the COSMIC desktop environment. COSMIC Text Editor will offer features like syntax highlighting, standard keyboard shortcuts, find, spellcheck, project support, revert changes, document statistics, and even Git management support. It provides a simple and intuitive interface, making it suitable for both basic and more complex tasks like writing code. COSMIC Text Editor will be available for free when the COSMIC Desktop OS is released.

Another powerful text editor for Linux is Kate, which is the KDE Plasma equivalent of Gedit. Kate offers a few additional features compared to Gedit, such as multi-cursor and multi-cursor selection, which allows you to select and manipulate multiple strings of text simultaneously.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/bankrupt-ev-startup-arrival-sold-its-assets-to-canoo/,Bankrupt EV startup Arrival sold its assets to Canoo,"Bankrupt electric vehicle (EV) startup Arrival has recently sold some of its assets, including advanced manufacturing equipment, to struggling startup Canoo, which is also in the EV market. This acquisition is seen as a cost-saving measure for Canoo, with the aim of reducing capital expenditures by 20%. Canoo plans to transport the purchased assets, which are packed into more than 20 container ships, to its facility in Oklahoma. The company has previously acquired all of Arrival's new and ""like-new"" assets in the United States. It remains unclear whether Canoo has also acquired any of Arrival's intellectual property (IP).

Arrival had previously announced its intention to sell off assets and IP from its U.K. division after filing for bankruptcy protection in the country. The company, once valued at over $13 billion and backed by Hyundai and UPS, had ambitious plans to revolutionize EV production by building compact ""microfactories"" in city centers. These plans, which included producing electric buses, vans, and a purpose-built car for Uber, fell apart as Arrival faced financial difficulties and a series of executive departures. The company underwent restructuring multiple times, resulting in layoffs, and shifted its focus to the United States instead of the U.K. market to preserve capital. However, Arrival never managed to produce commercial vehicles at scale, and its market valuation has plummeted to around $7.7 million. As a result, the company eventually filed for bankruptcy.

Canoo, on the other hand, has encountered its own challenges. After going public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, the company faced difficulties in manufacturing its EV. The vehicle features an eye-catching design based on a ""skateboard"" architecture that houses the batteries and electric drivetrain underneath the cabin. Despite reporting a sales pipeline of over $1 billion, largely due to a deal with Walmart to purchase up to 10,000 units, Canoo has struggled to convert these sales into actual deliveries. As a pre-revenue company, Canoo has been burning through cash and has resorted to stock splits and issuing more shares to stay afloat. In fact, its stock price dropped below $1, triggering a delisting notice from the Nasdaq Exchange, forcing the company to move to a different tier.

Both Arrival and Canoo have faced significant challenges in the EV market. Arrival's bankruptcy and subsequent sale of assets to Canoo highlight the difficulties faced by startups in the industry. It remains to be seen how Canoo will utilize Arrival's assets and whether it can overcome its own production and delivery struggles. The EV market continues to be highly competitive, with established players like Tesla dominating the industry. However, as the demand for electric vehicles increases and technology advances, there may still be opportunities for new entrants like Canoo to succeed. Only time will tell if Canoo can navigate the challenging landscape and establish itself as a player in the EV market.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/canoo-walmart-arkansas.jpg?resize=1200,670",2024-03-25 22:15:20,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/dma-first-formal-probes/,"Apple, Google and Meta face first formal investigations under EU's DMA","What’s the collective noun for investigations on Big Tech? Because the European Union has just announced a pile of probes on gatekeepers designated under the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Alphabet/Google, Apple, and Meta are facing the first formal non-compliance investigations under the bloc’s rebooted ex ante competition rulebook.

Alphabet/Google’s rules on steering in Google Play and its approach to self-preferencing in search results are in the frame. For Apple, the EU is also looking at its rules on steering in the App Store and the design of choice screens for alternatives to its Safari web browser. While Meta’s “pay or consent” model will be scrutinized by the Commission.

In total, five investigations were announced Monday — less than three weeks since the compliance deadline kicked in for the companies earlier this month.

The three gatekeepers, which were designated under the pan-EU market power and contestability regulation last fall, face a formal investigation in these areas to determine whether they are breaching the rulebook, as the Commission suspects. Confirmed violations of the DMA can result in fines of up to 10% of global annual turnover or even 20% for repeat offenses.

The EU will have up to 12 months to conclude the investigations, per recommended timeframes in the DMA. A preliminary report can be produced within six months. Although senior Commission officials noted Monday that the probes may conclude sooner or could take longer than these guidelines.

The enforcement action by the bloc comes as antitrust scrutiny continues to dial up on the three U.S. firms on home turf, too.

Since the three companies unveiled their DMA compliance plans, there has been a range of criticism that the proposals do not comply with the new EU law.

Google has been accused of seeking to avoid the regulation’s ban on self-preferencing by launching new rich features in search results that compete unfairly with rivals. While Apple’s use of notifications to users warning them of risks of stepping outside its walled garden has been attacked by developers as “scare screens”, among a number of criticisms. And Meta’s ‘pay or be tracked’ tactic has been roundly condemned as exploitative abuse by privacy and consumer rights groups. (Earlier this month, the Commission sent Meta questions about this under the DMA’s sister regulation, the Digital Services Act, too.)

“The Commission has opened proceedings to assess whether the measures implemented by Alphabet and Apple in relation to their obligations pertaining to app stores are in breach of the DMA. Article 5(4) of the DMA requires gatekeepers to allow app developers to “steer” consumers to offers outside the gatekeepers’ app stores, free of charge,” the Commission wrote, saying it’s concerned the pair’s steering measures “may not be fully compliant as they impose various restrictions and limitations”, pointing, for example, to constraints on developers’ ability to “freely communicate and promote offers and directly conclude contracts”.

On concerns about Google self-preferencing, the EU said the investigation will focus on Google’s vertical search services (e.g., Google Shopping; Google Flights; Google Hotels) and the impact its action may have on similar rival services.

“The Commission is concerned that Alphabet’s measures implemented to comply with the DMA may not ensure that third-party services featuring on Google’s search results page are treated in a fair and non-discriminatory manner in comparison with Alphabet’s own services, as required by Article 6(5) of the DMA,” it wrote.

On Apple, the EU will also look at whether it’s complying with a range of user choice obligations on iOS — including enabling end-users to easily uninstall apps, easily change default settings, and prompt users with choice screens which it says “must effectively and easily allow them to select an alternative default service, such as a browser or search engine on their iPhones”.

“The Commission is concerned that Apple’s measures, including the design of the web browser choice screen, may be preventing users from truly exercising their choice of services within the Apple ecosystem, in contravention of Article 6(3) of the DMA,” it added.

On Meta, the EU said the proceedings will investigate whether its recently introduced “pay or consent” model for EU users complies with Article 5(2) of the DMA, noting that this portion of the regulation “requires gatekeepers to obtain consent from users when they intend to combine or cross-use their personal data across different core platform services”.

“The Commission is concerned that the binary choice imposed by Meta’s ‘pay or consent’ model may not provide a real alternative in case users do not consent, thereby not achieving the objective of preventing the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers,” it said.

Responding to a question about this probe during Monday’s press conference, the EU’s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, said the DMA puts a clear requirement on gatekeepers to offer a free, non-p","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1031626648.jpg?resize=1200,799",2024-03-25 12:10:10,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-high-efficiency-based-copperiodide-clusters.html,A high efficiency LED based on copper-iodide clusters,"A team of researchers from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), led by Prof. Yao Hongbin, has made significant progress in developing a highly efficient and bright warm white light-emitting diode (LED) using copper-iodide cluster hybrids. This breakthrough, published in Nature Photonics, could pave the way for the next generation of solid-state lighting technology.

Solution-processed LEDs are considered the future of large-area solid-state lighting due to their simple manufacturing process and high operability. Previous advancements in this field have focused on lead-halide perovskites, organic semiconductor materials, and colloidal core-shell quantum dots (QDs) as the basis for solution-processed LED devices, which have shown impressive electroluminescence performance.

However, the use of heavy metals like lead-halide perovskites and CdSe QDs in these materials has raised serious environmental concerns. Additionally, LED devices based on organic light-emitting molecules, InP QDs, and ZnSe QDs have proven to be expensive to produce due to their complex synthesis. Therefore, finding a solution-processed LED based on low-cost, low-toxicity, easily scalable, and highly efficient emitters has become a crucial challenge for the advancement of solid-state lighting.

To tackle this challenge, Prof. Yao's team designed and prepared a copper-iodine-based hybrid cluster with a broad photoluminescence spectrum. By introducing nitrogen-phosphine chelating ligands and phosphine-containing solubilizing ligands, the team successfully obtained copper-iodide hybrid clusters that exhibited both high luminescence efficiency and high solubility. These clusters demonstrated a solubility of more than 200 mg/mL and good structural stability in N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF), a cross-solvent commonly used in LED production.

The team then used spin-coating in DMF to fabricate luminescent thin films with a low surface roughness of 0.22 nm and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of over 70%. These thin films served as a luminescent layer in the production of low-cost warm-white LED devices through an orthogonal solvent route. The resulting LED devices achieved outstanding performance, including a maximum external quantum efficiency of 19.1%, a brightness exceeding 40,000 cd m-2, and an operational lifetime of more than 232 hours (T50 @100 cd m-2). Furthermore, the team successfully constructed a large-area solution-processed LED device with a working area of 36 cm2 through blade-coating. This device exhibited warm white light emission with a brightness close to 60,000 cd m-2, demonstrating the scalability and versatility of the approach.

In addition to warm white LEDs, the team also developed a series of solution-processed color-tunable LED devices by modifying different electron-donating groups on the nitrogen heterocycles of the nitrogen-phosphine chelating ligands. This achievement further expands the possibilities for solution-processed LED technology.

The development of high-efficiency and high-brightness LED devices based on copper-iodide hybrid clusters is a significant advancement in the field. The structural expandability and spectral tunability of these clusters make them highly promising for the fabrication of low-cost, high-performance LED panels and solid-state lighting.

This breakthrough from Prof. Yao's team brings us one step closer to realizing the full potential of solution-processed LEDs. By addressing the environmental concerns and high production costs associated with existing LED technologies, this research opens up new possibilities for the widespread adoption of solid-state lighting. With further advancements and refinements, solution-processed LEDs could revolutionize the lighting industry, offering energy-efficient and cost-effective lighting solutions for a brighter and more sustainable future.
