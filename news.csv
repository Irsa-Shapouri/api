https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) may seem like unlikely partners, but they actually share a lot in common. Both companies stumbled upon their core businesses through fortuitous circumstances. AWS realized it could sell its internal services, such as storage and computing power, to external customers. Nvidia discovered that its gaming GPU was also well-suited for processing AI workloads. As a result, both companies have experienced explosive revenue growth in recent years.

Nvidia's revenue has been growing at an astonishing rate, moving from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024 to $22.1 billion in Q4 2024. However, the majority of this growth can be attributed to Nvidia's data center business. On the other hand, AWS has consistently been a major revenue driver for Amazon, although its growth has started to slow down. While both companies have enjoyed first-mover advantages, they now face competition from the likes of Microsoft and Google.

The success of Nvidia and AWS can be attributed to being in the right place at the right time. As web apps and mobile technology emerged, the cloud became a valuable resource for enterprises looking to move their workloads or build applications. Similarly, the rise of AI and large language models coincided with the increased use of GPUs for processing these workloads.

While AWS has grown into a highly profitable business, Nvidia's growth has surpassed it in recent years. However, the question remains whether Nvidia can sustain this growth and become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS. If the GPU market tightens, Nvidia does have other businesses, but these are smaller revenue generators that are growing at a slower pace than the data center business.

In the short term, Nvidia's revenue growth is expected to continue. The company anticipates $24 billion in revenue for its current quarter (Q1 FY25), representing a growth rate of around 234% compared to the same period last year. However, analysts predict that Nvidia's growth rate will decline in the future. Despite this, the company is still expected to scale its revenue past the $100 billion annual run rate mark for several more quarters.

AI is likely to be a significant driver of growth for Nvidia in the coming years, even as competition from AMD, Intel, and other chipmakers emerges. While Nvidia may face stiffer competition in the future, it currently dominates the market. At the chip level, Nvidia holds a strong position, according to IDC. However, AMD is gaining ground at the board level, as reported by Jon Peddie Research.

Overall, Nvidia and AWS have experienced remarkable growth, thanks to their ability to capitalize on emerging technologies and market trends. While challenges lie ahead, both companies have established themselves as major players in their respective industries. As long as they continue to innovate and adapt, they have the potential to maintain their positions as leaders in the market.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.zdnet.com/article/saving-hours-of-work-with-ai-how-chatgpt-became-my-virtual-assistant-for-a-data-project/,Saving hours of work with AI: How ChatGPT became my virtual assistant for a data project,"Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has received a lot of attention lately, with tools like ChatGPT capturing the imagination of many. While it's easy to get caught up in the hype, it's important to remember that these tools are just that – tools. They can be incredibly helpful in assisting with various projects, much like other productivity software.

In this article, I'll share a project where ChatGPT proved to be a valuable time-saver. While your specific projects may differ, I hope to inspire you with my thought process and demonstrate how you can leverage ChatGPT as a workhorse tool.

The Project: A ""Stunt Article"" on Temu Purchases
In a month or so, I'll be publishing what I like to call a ""stunt article."" These articles are fun projects that I come up with, designed to capture readers' interest. The current project involves showcasing how much computer gear I can buy from Temu for under $100. I managed to stay within budget, spending a total of $99.77.

To create this article, I needed to browse the Temu website to find items to feature. For example, I discovered an iPad keyboard and mouse combo that costs around $6. To ensure I stayed within the $100 budget, I wanted to compile all the Temu links in a spreadsheet, record each item's price, and rearrange things until I reached the desired total.

The challenge was converting the Temu links into a usable format. That's where ChatGPT came to the rescue.

Phase 1: Gathering the Links
The first step was to gather all the links. I copied each product's link from Temu and pasted it into a Notion page. Notion offers the option to create bookmark blocks that contain both links and product names. Here's a snapshot of the page:

[Insert Screenshot]

As you can see, I started selecting the blocks. Once all the relevant blocks were selected, I copied them and pasted the entire set into a text editor. The resulting text may look messy, but it served its purpose.

Phase 2: Identifying the Data
Now, let's examine one of the data blocks. I switched my editor to a light mode to make it easier for you to see the data elements within the block:

[Insert Screenshot]

Within each block, there are three key elements. The gold text represents the product's name enclosed in braces. The green text indicates the base URL surrounded by parentheses. To simplify things, I only needed the main URL and not the random tracking data appended to the Temu page. The purple sections highlight the delimiters – this is the data we'll feed into ChatGPT.

Phase 3: Teaching ChatGPT to Recognize the Data
I initiated a conversation with ChatGPT and provided the following prompt:

""Accept the following data and await further instructions.""

Then, I copied the information from the text editor and pasted it into ChatGPT. At this point, ChatGPT understood that it needed to wait for additional details.

The next step was crucial. I wanted ChatGPT to extract the titles and links while disregarding the rest. Here's the prompt I used:

""The data above consists of a series of blocks. Each block begins with a section enclosed in [] brackets, which represents the title. Following the brackets is an open parenthesis (followed by a web URL). Extract the URL from each block, excluding everything after the question mark, including the question mark itself. Most URLs will end in .html. Display the title, followed by a carriage return, the URL, and two newlines.""

This process served two purposes. Firstly, it allowed me to assign names to the data for future reference. Secondly, it tested ChatGPT's understanding of the task.

ChatGPT successfully completed the assignment, although it paused when its buffer ran out. I instructed the bot to continue, and it provided the remaining data. Completing this task manually would have involved tedious cutting and pasting, but ChatGPT handled it in under a minute.

Phase 4: Simplifying Temu's Complex Titles
For my project, the titles provided by Temu were overly complex. Instead of including the full description, I wanted the titles to be concise and straightforward. For example:

Original: ""10 Inch LCD Writing Tablet, Electronis Memo With Leather Protective Case, Electronic Drawing Board For Digital Handwriting Pad Doodle Board, Gifts For""

Simplified: ""LCD writing tablet with case""

I gave this assignment to ChatGPT as well, reminding it that it had already parsed and identified the data. I find that refreshing ChatGPT's memory about previous steps helps it incorporate the information more accurately.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/webroot/2024/03/25/9-tips-to-protect-your-family-against-identity-theft-and-credit-and-bank-fraud/,9 Tips To Protect Your Family Against Identity Theft And Credit And Bank Fraud,"Did you know that every year, more than nine million Americans fall victim to identity theft? Criminals are constantly on the lookout for personal information stored in various databases, and once they have access, they can wreak havoc on your financial stability and reputation. But fear not! By following these nine tips, you and your loved ones can protect yourselves from identity theft, credit fraud, and bank fraud.

1. Safeguard your personal information: Your name, address, date of birth, and social security number are like gold to identity thieves. To prevent them from getting their hands on this valuable information, be cautious about sharing it over the phone or via email. Additionally, shred any documents that contain personal details.

2. Use strong and unique passwords: Your passwords are the first line of defense against hackers. Make sure they are at least eight characters long and include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. It's crucial to use different passwords for each of your accounts to prevent hackers from gaining access to multiple sites if one password is compromised. Consider using a password manager to generate and store strong passwords securely.

3. Regularly monitor your accounts: Stay vigilant by regularly checking your bank and credit card statements for any unauthorized transactions. If you spot any suspicious activity, report it immediately to your bank or credit card company.

4. Beware of phishing scams: Phishing scams are emails or text messages that appear to be from legitimate sources, like your bank or credit card company. These messages often ask for personal information or contain malicious links. Always double-check the source of any message and avoid clicking on links or providing personal information unless you are certain it is legitimate.

5. Enable two-factor authentication: Two-factor authentication provides an extra layer of security for your online accounts. In addition to your password, you'll need to provide a second form of identification, such as a code sent to your phone. Even if your account information is compromised, hackers won't be able to access your account without this additional verification.

6. Secure your devices and connections: Your devices, including computers and smartphones, can be easily hacked or compromised if you don't take the necessary precautions. Keep your devices up to date with antivirus software and ensure they are password-protected. Avoid using public Wi-Fi networks, as they are often unsecured. If you need to access sensitive information on the go, use a virtual private network (VPN) to protect your identity and maintain anonymity.

7. Keep an eye on your credit reports: You are entitled to a free credit report once a year from each of the three major credit bureaus. Regularly check your credit report to detect any suspicious activity, such as unauthorized accounts or loans. Consider using a reputable credit monitoring service that provides real-time alerts and protection, including Social Security Number (SSN) monitoring.

8. Stay informed about the latest scams: Criminals are constantly evolving their scam tactics, especially with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). They can now impersonate friends or family members, even through phone calls or video chats. Stay updated on the latest scam techniques by following reputable cybersecurity experts and checking reliable news outlets. Be extra cautious with unsolicited emails and messages, and always verify a person's identity before sharing personal information.

9. Invest in identity protection for your family: For comprehensive identity protection, consider investing in a package like Webroot Premium. It offers protection against viruses, malware, scams, and other cyber threats. The package also includes password management to keep your credentials safe. With coverage for up to 10 family members, including children and seniors, you can ensure the safety of your entire household.

By following these nine tips, you can minimize the risk of identity theft and protect your family's financial well-being. Stay proactive, stay informed, and stay safe in the digital age.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ea0c800c8aac72387356ac/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 11:48:19,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/techcrunch-mobility-the-wheels-are-starting-to-come-off-the-fisker-ev-bus/,TechCrunch Mobility: The wheels are starting to come off the Fisker EV bus,"Welcome to TechCrunch Mobility, your go-to source for all things transportation. In this week's newsletter, we'll be discussing the latest developments in the automotive industry, as well as some exciting startup news. So, buckle up and let's dive in!

But before we get into the nitty-gritty, let's talk about some recent activity on Capitol Hill. The Biden Administration has proposed two new standards through the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that will have a significant impact on U.S. automakers and consumers like yourself. While these regulations have been adjusted to appease industry stakeholders, they still impose stricter requirements than before.

The DOE has introduced a ""petroleum equivalency factor"" that assigns a score to electric vehicles (EVs) under the government's corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. This proposal aims to prevent automakers from facing hefty fines for non-compliance. On the other hand, the EPA has released tailpipe standards for 2027 to 2032 model year vehicles, which impose more stringent requirements on automakers. However, these standards allow for flexibility in meeting the rules through various powertrains, without mandating a complete shift to electric vehicles.

So, what does this mean for EV startups? Well, companies like Rivian, Tesla, and Lucid, which already meet the clean car standards, won't be significantly affected. However, legacy automakers that are investing in EV development while still profiting from internal combustion engines will face challenges. Interestingly, plug-in hybrids might emerge as winners in this scenario.

Moving on to some exciting news, let's talk about Rivian's partnership with Tesla. These two industry giants have joined forces to develop advanced electric vehicle technologies, which could revolutionize the automotive industry. This collaboration highlights the importance of cooperation and innovation in shaping the future of transportation.

In other startup news, Candela, an electric boat manufacturer, has secured $25 million in funding. This investment, led by Groupe Beneteau, will enable Candela to further develop its cutting-edge electric boats and contribute to the growing trend of sustainable water transportation.

Now, let's shift our focus to Uber, which recently made its first investment in an Africa-founded startup. Moove, a mobility fintech company, raised $100 million in a Series B funding round led by Uber. Moove provides vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers, aligning with Uber's goal of achieving a fully zero-emission fleet by 2040. This investment highlights Uber's commitment to supporting sustainable transportation solutions worldwide.

Lastly, let's discuss an interesting startup called Amber. This Bay Area company offers an aftermarket Tesla extended warranty product, providing Tesla owners with peace of mind and protection for their vehicles. Amber recently raised $3.18 million in a seed round, signaling the market's demand for reliable and comprehensive warranty options.

That wraps up this week's newsletter. Stay tuned for more exciting updates on the future of transportation. Until next time, keep driving towards a greener and smarter world!

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-household-robots-common.html,Engineering household robots to have a little common sense,"Robots are becoming increasingly skilled at carrying out household tasks, from cleaning up spills to serving meals. Many of these robots learn through imitation, where they copy the movements guided by a human. However, they often struggle to handle unexpected situations that deviate from their trained path. To address this challenge, engineers at MIT have developed a method that combines robot motion data with the ""common sense knowledge"" of large language models (LLMs).

The MIT engineers' approach allows a robot to break down a given household task into subtasks and adjust its movements based on disruptions within each subtask. This means that the robot can continue with the task without starting from scratch or relying on explicit programming for every failure. The method helps the robot self-correct execution errors, leading to improved overall task success.

The researchers illustrate their approach using the example of scooping marbles from one bowl and pouring them into another. Typically, engineers would demonstrate the entire task in one continuous trajectory for the robot to mimic. However, the MIT team realized that tasks consist of a sequence of subtasks. For instance, the robot must first reach into the bowl before scooping the marbles and then move to the empty bowl. If the robot makes a mistake during any of these subtasks, it would usually have to start again from the beginning unless explicit labeling and additional demonstrations were provided.

To automate this process, the researchers turned to large language models (LLMs). These models process vast amounts of text to establish connections between words, sentences, and paragraphs. By prompting an LLM, it can generate a logical list of subtasks for a given task. For example, when asked about the actions involved in scooping marbles, an LLM might produce a sequence of verbs like ""reach,"" ""scoop,"" ""transport,"" and ""pour.""

The MIT team developed an algorithm to connect the LLM's natural language labels for subtasks with the robot's position in physical space or an image that represents the robot's state. This process, known as ""grounding,"" enables the robot to automatically determine its stage in the task and replan or recover on its own.

The researchers will present their new approach at the International Conference on Learning Representations in May 2024. This innovative method has the potential to enhance robot performance in various household tasks, allowing them to adapt to disruptions and improve task completion.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/non-sexy-industries-can-appeal-to-investors-too/,Non-sexy industries can appeal to investors too,"Welcome to TechCrunch Fintech! In this edition, we will be highlighting some exciting fintech startups in Africa, discussing how Copilot has benefited from Mint's closure, and exploring the increased support from VCs for a particular expense management startup.

Africa's fintech ecosystem has experienced a drop in venture funding recently, but there have been some positive developments. Uber recently led a $100 million investment in African mobility fintech company Moove, pushing its valuation to $750 million. Zone, a decentralized payment infrastructure, also secured $8.5 million in funding to scale its operations. Additionally, Tanzanian payments company Nala successfully pivoted to offer remittance services in 2021 and built a B2B payment platform.

The closure of budgeting app Mint by Intuit has created opportunities for other startups in the space. Copilot, in particular, has experienced significant growth in the past four months, surpassing its growth over the previous four years. This growth led to a $6 million Series A funding round led by Adjacent. Copilot initially launched with $250,000 in angel funding and later added support for Apple Card. Similarly, Monarch Money co-founder Ozzie Osman stated that Mint's closure was advantageous for their company.

It's not just flashy industries that can attract investors. Expense management startup Coast has seen a 550% revenue growth in the past year by targeting businesses with real-world field personnel and fleets to manage. The company recently secured an additional $25 million in equity funding. Onyx Private, a digital bank backed by Y Combinator, initially aimed to serve high-earning millennials and Gen Zers. However, it recently announced the termination of its bank operations and account closures, shifting its focus to B2B services. Swiss fintech nsave raised $4 million in seed funding to make banking accessible to individuals in countries with unstable banking sectors or facing high inflation.

In an interview on the TechCrunch Found podcast, Eric Glyman, the co-founder and CEO of Ramp, expressed his belief that the fintech industry, including companies like his own, is only scratching the surface of its potential. Despite significant growth, Glyman believes Ramp has tapped into just 1% of its potential market share. Fun fact: Both Ramp and Deel celebrated their fifth anniversaries this week, just one day apart.

The U.S. Justice Department's antitrust complaint against Apple and its iPhone business specifically targets Apple's financial services. This complaint highlights the scale of Apple's financial operations.

In other news, Bolt and Checkout.com have partnered to offer frictionless commerce. Rewards startup Fetch raised $50 million from Morgan Stanley to capitalize on the private credit boom. Wealthfront has delayed its plans for an IPO. Affirm Holdings director Keith Rabois sold shares worth over $318,000. Cloud banking tech provider nCino acquired DocFox.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/dma-first-formal-probes/,"Apple, Google and Meta face first formal investigations under EU's DMA","What is the collective noun for investigations on Big Tech? Well, it seems like the European Union has just unleashed a wave of probes on gatekeepers designated under the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Alphabet/Google, Apple, and Meta are now facing the first formal non-compliance investigations under the bloc's revamped ex ante competition rulebook.

Alphabet/Google's rules on steering in Google Play and its approach to self-preferencing in search results are under scrutiny. The EU is also examining Apple's rules on steering in the App Store and the design of choice screens for alternatives to its Safari web browser. And let's not forget about Meta's ""pay or consent"" model, which will be thoroughly scrutinized by the Commission.

In total, five investigations were announced on Monday, just weeks after the compliance deadline for the companies earlier this month. These three gatekeepers, designated under the pan-EU market power and contestability regulation last fall, now face formal investigation in these areas to determine if they are violating the rulebook, as suspected by the Commission. The DMA violations can result in fines of up to 10% of global annual turnover, and even up to 20% for repeat offenses.

The EU will have up to 12 months to conclude the investigations, as per the recommended timeframes in the DMA. A preliminary report may be produced within six months. However, senior Commission officials noted that the probes may conclude sooner or take longer than the suggested guidelines.

This enforcement action by the EU comes as antitrust scrutiny on the three US firms continues to intensify on their home turf as well. Ever since the companies unveiled their DMA compliance plans, there has been a barrage of criticism, with many claiming that their proposals do not comply with the new EU law.

Google has been accused of trying to circumvent the regulation's ban on self-preferencing by launching new rich features in search results that unfairly compete with rivals. Apple's use of notifications to warn users about the risks of leaving its walled garden has been attacked by developers, who refer to these notifications as ""scare screens"" among other criticisms. And Meta's ""pay or be tracked"" tactic has faced widespread condemnation from privacy and consumer rights groups. In fact, earlier this month, the Commission even sent Meta questions about this under the DMA's sister regulation, the Digital Services Act.

""The Commission has opened proceedings to assess whether the measures implemented by Alphabet and Apple in relation to their obligations pertaining to app stores are in breach of the DMA. Article 5(4) of the DMA requires gatekeepers to allow app developers to 'steer' consumers to offers outside the gatekeepers' app stores, free of charge,"" wrote the Commission. It expressed concerns that the steering measures of both Alphabet and Apple may not be fully compliant, as they impose various restrictions and limitations. For example, these measures constrain developers' ability to freely communicate, promote offers, and directly conclude contracts.

Regarding Google's self-preferencing, the EU's investigation will focus on Google's vertical search services such as Google Shopping, Google Flights, and Google Hotels. They aim to determine the impact of Google's actions on similar rival services. The Commission is concerned that Alphabet's measures, implemented to comply with the DMA, may not ensure fair and non-discriminatory treatment of third-party services featured on Google's search results page, as required by Article 6(5) of the DMA.

As for Apple, the EU will also examine whether it is meeting a range of user choice obligations on iOS. This includes allowing users to easily uninstall apps, change default settings, and be prompted with choice screens that effectively and easily enable them to select an alternative default service, such as a browser or search engine on their iPhones. The Commission is concerned that Apple's measures, including the design of the web browser choice screen, may prevent users from truly exercising their choice of services within the Apple ecosystem, contravening Article 6(3) of the DMA.

Lastly, the proceedings against Meta will investigate whether its recently introduced ""pay or consent"" model for EU users complies with Article 5(2) of the DMA. The EU notes that this portion of the regulation requires gatekeepers to obtain consent from users when they intend to combine or cross-use their personal data across different core platform services. The Commission is concerned that Meta's binary choice imposed by the ""pay or consent"" model may not provide a genuine alternative in case users do not consent, thus failing to achieve the objective of preventing the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers.

During a press conference on Monday, Thierry Breton, the EU's internal market commissioner, responded to a question about this probe, stating that the DMA clearly requires gatekeepers to offer a free, non-preferential choice to users.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1031626648.jpg?resize=1200,799",2024-03-25 12:10:10,Innovation,Innovation
