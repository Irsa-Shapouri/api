Here's the good, the bad, and the ugly","DevOps engineering is a highly sought-after job in today's economy. However, to excel in this role, you need a combination of technical expertise and business acumen. Moreover, continuous learning is essential as popular approaches quickly become outdated.

DevOps engineers are in high demand as they oversee the automation and collaboration of cloud and on-premises environments to ensure the seamless development and deployment of software. Not only is it a fulfilling job, but it also offers a lucrative salary. In the United States, the average salary for a DevOps engineer is approximately $134,000 per year.

To succeed in this role, it is crucial to have a strong foundation in technology. According to Brad Morgan, a seasoned DevOps engineer, one of the key skills to acquire is proficiency in Linux. Regardless of your specific DevOps responsibilities, interfacing with Linux is a fundamental aspect of the job. Having a solid understanding of Linux basics, along with familiarity with the terminal and basic commands, is essential.

Additionally, bash scripting plays a significant role in the DevOps world. Many pipelines in DevOps rely on scripting, particularly bash scripting, to automate Linux commands. Therefore, acquiring expertise in bash scripting is highly beneficial for DevOps engineers.

Cloud skills are also indispensable for DevOps engineers. Familiarizing yourself with a mainstream cloud provider like AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure can open up various opportunities and make you more desirable to potential employers. Instead of trying to master multiple cloud platforms simultaneously, focus on learning the nuances of one provider at a time. Becoming an expert in one cloud platform simplifies the process of picking up others in the future.

Unlike some professions that follow a specific course of study, there is no formal path to becoming a DevOps engineer. Self-learning is crucial for anyone pursuing a career in this field. Constantly acquiring new knowledge, enjoying the process of learning, and consistently challenging yourself are essential traits for success in DevOps engineering.

Another experienced DevOps engineer, ""Homebrew Henry,"" emphasizes the importance of continuous learning in this field. The DevOps ecosystem is vast and continuously evolving. Tools and frameworks that were once popular may be replaced by newer alternatives. DevOps engineers need to allocate their free time for studying and staying up to date with the latest developments.

As you gain more experience, the learning process never stops. In fact, this is one of the aspects that DevOps engineers love most about their job. The pace of development, combined with the introduction of AI tools like ChatGPT, means that DevOps engineering today will be different from DevOps engineering two or three years from now.

One aspect that distinguishes passionate DevOps engineers from their colleagues is their enthusiasm for infrastructure management. Managing infrastructure is a significant part of the job, and if you're not fond of it, you may find it challenging. DevOps engineers spend a considerable amount of time setting up, configuring, and maintaining the cloud infrastructure that supports various applications. This involves dealing with servers, databases, networks, and security on a daily basis. If you find this aspect exciting, then DevOps engineering might be the perfect fit for you.

However, if you lean more towards software engineering, you may not find writing Terraform code, CI/CD pipelines, and automation scripts as satisfying as building customer-facing applications. It's important to note that transitioning from software engineering to DevOps (and vice versa) is entirely possible. Many individuals have successfully made this transition, so don't feel locked into one path if you choose to pursue another.

Finally, it's essential to consider the business side of DevOps. Unrealistic expectations often surround the role, with businesses hoping that hiring a few engineers will magically solve all their problems. As a DevOps engineer, you need to manage these expectations and ensure that stakeholders have a realistic understanding of what DevOps can achieve.

In conclusion, DevOps engineering is a rewarding and in-demand profession. To excel in this field, you need a strong technical foundation, a commitment to continuous learning, and a passion for infrastructure management. By embracing these aspects and managing expectations, you can thrive as a DevOps engineer.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/e4d3d8d263eb00323161fcf2566ad35a3fe52282/2024/03/25/1b8b924e-2629-43c2-b416-1b990e262786/gettyimages-1319039490.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.zdnet.com/article/saving-hours-of-work-with-ai-how-chatgpt-became-my-virtual-assistant-for-a-data-project/,Saving hours of work with AI: How ChatGPT became my virtual assistant for a data project,"Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been making headlines lately, and for good reason. Tools like ChatGPT have proven to be incredibly useful in various projects, providing assistance and saving time. In this article, I'll walk you through a project where ChatGPT helped me gather and organize data for an upcoming article. While your projects may differ, I hope this inspires you to explore how ChatGPT can be a valuable tool in your own work.

The project at hand involves creating an article about how much computer gear I can buy from Temu for under $100. To achieve this, I needed to scour the Temu site for items to feature and ensure they fit within my budget. This required gathering the product links, finding their prices, and manipulating them until I reached my desired total budget.

To start, I collected all the Temu links and pasted them into a Notion page. Notion conveniently allows you to create bookmark blocks that not only contain links but also product names. This made it easier to identify and extract the necessary data. Once I had all the blocks selected, I copied them and pasted them into a text editor.

Although the page may have appeared messy, the result was a useful collection of data. Each data block contained three key elements: the product name, the base URL, and extra tracking data. I wanted ChatGPT to extract the titles and links while discarding the rest.

To teach ChatGPT to recognize and extract the data, I provided it with a prompt. This prompt instructed ChatGPT to accept the data and await further instructions. I then copied the data from the text editor and pasted it into ChatGPT, ensuring that it understood there was more to come.

The next step was crucial. I needed ChatGPT to identify the titles and links within each data block. I provided a prompt that explained the structure of the data and how to extract the relevant information. This allowed me to name the data for future reference and test whether ChatGPT understood the task.

ChatGPT successfully completed the assignment, although it did require a prompt to continue when its buffer ran out. Nonetheless, ChatGPT completed the task in less than a minute, saving me a significant amount of time compared to doing it manually.

The final phase involved cleaning up the overly complex titles provided by Temu. I wanted simpler and more concise titles for my project. For example, instead of ""10 Inch LCD Writing Tablet, Electronis Memo With Leather Protective Case, Electronic Drawing Board For Digital Handwriting Pad Doodle Board, Gifts For,"" I preferred ""LCD writing tablet with case."" I assigned this task to ChatGPT as well, reminding it of the previous steps it had taken.

By leveraging ChatGPT's capabilities and guiding it through the project, I was able to efficiently gather and organize the necessary data for my article. ChatGPT proved to be a valuable workhorse, providing assistance and saving time. While your projects may differ, I encourage you to explore how ChatGPT can streamline your tasks and boost productivity.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/70d8814af33b190ff84b8faa5f9bafe13d3586e2/2024/03/25/7d1cb1ff-3bb7-4972-a6cd-33d04da76bc1/cover.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/webroot/2024/03/25/9-tips-to-protect-your-family-against-identity-theft-and-credit-and-bank-fraud/,9 Tips To Protect Your Family Against Identity Theft And Credit And Bank Fraud,"Did you know that millions of Americans fall victim to identity theft each year? Your personal information is stored in countless databases, making it a prime target for criminals. They can use this information to drain your bank account, damage your credit, and even result in criminal records. But fear not! There are steps you can take to protect yourself and your family from identity theft and fraud. In this article, we will explore nine tips to enable family protection and keep your identities safe.

1. Safeguard your personal information: Your name, address, date of birth, and social security number are goldmines for identity thieves. Protect yourself by shredding documents that contain personal information, and avoid sharing sensitive details over the phone or email.

2. Use strong and unique passwords: Your passwords are the first line of defense against hackers. Make sure your passwords are at least eight characters long and include a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using the same password for multiple accounts, as a single data breach can compromise all your accounts. Consider using a password manager to generate and store strong passwords securely.

3. Regularly monitor your accounts: Stay vigilant by checking your bank and credit card statements regularly. By doing so, you can detect any unauthorized transactions early and report them to your financial institution promptly.

4. Beware of phishing scams: Criminals often send emails or text messages that appear to be from legitimate sources, such as your bank or credit card company. These phishing scams aim to trick you into providing personal information or clicking on malicious links. Always double-check the source of any message and avoid clicking on suspicious links or sharing personal information unless you are certain it is legitimate.

5. Enable two-factor authentication: Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts. In addition to your password, you will need to provide a second form of identification, such as a code sent to your phone. Even if your account information is compromised, hackers won't be able to access your account without this secondary identification.

6. Secure your devices and connections: Your computers, smartphones, and other devices can be vulnerable to hacking or compromise if not properly secured. Ensure your devices have up-to-date antivirus software and are password-protected. Avoid using public Wi-Fi networks for sensitive information, or consider using a VPN to hide your identity and stay anonymous.

7. Keep an eye on your credit reports: You are entitled to a free credit report once a year from each of the three major credit bureaus. Regularly check your credit report for any suspicious activity, such as unauthorized accounts or loans. Consider using a reputable credit monitoring service that provides real-time alerts and protection.

8. Stay informed about the latest scams: Criminals are constantly evolving their tactics, including leveraging artificial intelligence for scams. Stay informed by following reputable cybersecurity experts and checking reliable news outlets. Be cautious of unsolicited emails and messages, and always verify a person's identity before sharing personal information.

9. Invest in an identity protection package for your family: For the best protection, consider investing in a comprehensive identity protection plan. Webroot Premium, for example, offers protection against viruses, malware, scams, and other cyber threats. It also includes password management to keep your credentials safe. The plan covers up to 10 family members, including you, your partner, children, and even seniors aged 65+.

By following these nine tips, you can significantly reduce the risk of identity theft and fraud for you and your family. Remember, prevention is key, and taking proactive measures to protect your personal information is essential in today's digital age. Stay informed, stay vigilant, and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with knowing your identities are safe.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ea0c800c8aac72387356ac/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 11:48:19,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/boeing-ceo-to-leave-company-by-year-end-after-a-wave-of-safety-incidents/,Boeing CEO to leave company by year-end after a wave of safety incidents,"Boeing CEO, Dave Calhoun, is set to leave the company by the end of 2024 following a series of safety incidents that have plagued the airplane manufacturer. The decision comes after a cabin panel blowout on one of Boeing's planes and various other serious safety issues.

Boeing is known for its innovation acceleration program called Aerospace Xelerated, which was previously known as the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI). The program focuses on collaborating with startups in the aerospace industry. It remains unclear how Calhoun's departure will impact this program.

In a statement, Calhoun expressed his intention to complete the critical work needed to stabilize and position the company for the future in the upcoming months.

Earlier this year, an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 jet was forced to make an emergency landing, leading to the grounding of 171 Max 9 jets for several weeks. This incident marked Boeing's most significant safety crisis since the crashes of two Max 8 jets in 2018 and 2019, which resulted in the loss of 346 lives.

Alongside Calhoun, Stan Deal, who is in charge of Boeing's commercial airplanes business (BCA), will also be leaving the company. Stephanie Pope has been appointed to lead BCA. Pope has been serving as Boeing's chief operating officer since January 2024, and previously held the positions of president and CEO of Boeing Global Services.

This situation is still developing, and more information will be provided as it becomes available.

In conclusion, Boeing's CEO Dave Calhoun will be leaving the company by the end of 2024 due to a series of safety incidents that have plagued the company. The departure comes after a cabin panel blowout and other serious safety issues. Calhoun plans to complete critical work to stabilize and position the company for the future. Additionally, Stan Deal, head of Boeing's commercial airplanes business, will also be leaving, with Stephanie Pope taking over the role. This story is still developing, and more updates will follow.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1910140688.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-25 12:48:28,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/techcrunch-mobility-the-wheels-are-starting-to-come-off-the-fisker-ev-bus/,TechCrunch Mobility: The wheels are starting to come off the Fisker EV bus,"TechCrunch Mobility is a weekly newsletter that focuses on transportation news and insights. In this edition, we will discuss the Biden Administration's proposed standards for U.S. automakers, as well as other news in the mobility industry. But before we dive into that, let's talk about some recent developments on Capitol Hill.

The Biden Administration has released two new proposed standards through the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that will have a significant impact on U.S. automakers and consumers. While these regulations have been modified to accommodate the concerns of the automotive industry, they still impose stricter standards than before.

The DOE has introduced a ""petroleum equivalency factor"" that assigns a score to electric vehicles (EVs) under the government's corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. The original proposal would have made it difficult for automakers to meet these standards, resulting in substantial fines. However, the revised proposal is more lenient.

On the other hand, the EPA has released tailpipe standards for model year cars and light-duty trucks from 2027 to 2032. These standards impose stricter requirements on automakers but offer more flexibility in meeting them through various powertrain options. Unlike the original proposal, which mandated a 67% market share for EVs by 2032, the revised standards are technology-agnostic.

While these standards have little impact on EV startups like Rivian, Tesla, and Lucid, they do affect legacy automakers. These companies are investing heavily in EV development while still profiting from internal combustion engines. In this scenario, plug-in hybrids may emerge as the winners.

Now, let's move on to other news in the mobility industry. One interesting development is Uber's first investment in an Africa-founded startup. Uber has invested in Moove, an African mobility fintech that provides vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers. This investment aligns with Uber's goal of achieving a fully zero-emission fleet by 2040.

Additionally, we have news about Clevon, a company that develops autonomous delivery technology. Despite initial concerns about its financial situation, Clevon has secured funding and is expected to complete a merger with an American electric vehicle company in the coming months. However, the company has had to make some cost reductions, resulting in layoffs.

Another noteworthy deal is Amber, a startup that offers aftermarket Tesla extended warranties. Amber recently raised $3.18 million in a seed round and aims to provide Tesla owners with affordable warranty options. Similarly, Candela, an electric boat maker, raised $25 million in a funding round led by Groupe Beneteau.

Lastly, Pelikan Mobility, a French startup, received funding to develop its mobility solution. The details of this funding round are yet to be disclosed.

That's all for this week's TechCrunch Mobility. Stay tuned for more news and insights on the future of transportation.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1363022906.jpg?resize=1200,730",2024-03-24 19:00:33,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-deep-geothermal-renewable-powerhouse.html,Dig deep: US bets on geothermal to become renewable powerhouse,"Geothermal energy has the potential to become a significant source of clean and reliable power in the United States. Despite currently contributing only a small percentage to the country's energy production, there is increasing interest and investment in geothermal technology. The Biden administration, along with various businesses, believes that advancements in geothermal energy can play a crucial role in the transition to a greener future.

Jennifer Granholm, the Energy Secretary, spoke about the potential of geothermal energy at the CERAWeek conference in Houston. She emphasized that if harnessed effectively, the heat beneath our feet could provide clean and scalable power for various sectors, including industries and households. The Department of Energy estimates that geothermal energy could surpass hydroelectric and solar power in the US by 2050.

Currently, geothermal energy accounts for only 1.6 percent of the country's energy consumption. To increase production, the US government has invested over $200 million since 2018 in an experimental site in Utah. This site focuses on Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), a technology that involves drilling exceptionally deep wells and injecting water into hot rocks deep underground.

Unlike traditional geothermal energy, EGS does not rely on hot springs or underground reservoirs. Francesco d'Avack, an analyst with S&P Global Commodity Insights, explains that geothermal energy can potentially be harnessed anywhere. This approach also reduces the upfront risk associated with drilling, making it more attractive to investors.

In addition to reducing paperwork and delays, the US government is allowing companies to convert permits for oil or gas exploration into geothermal licenses. This move further incentivizes the development of geothermal energy. The Energy Department also highlights that EGS uses fewer chemical additives compared to fracking, a technique often criticized by environmentalists. Moreover, geothermal drilling does not release hydrocarbons like fracking does.

Geothermal energy provides a consistent flow of energy regardless of weather conditions or time of day, unlike solar or wind power. The US government estimates that the cost of geothermal energy will decrease from $70 to $100 per megawatt hour (MWh) to $45 by 2035. Leveraging existing drilling technology makes geothermal energy both quicker and cheaper to develop.

The US has been at the forefront of geothermal technology, demonstrating its potential and viability. While there are experimental EGS sites in other countries, the US remains a leader in this field. However, there are concerns about induced seismicity, similar to those associated with fracking. The US Energy Department has implemented a mitigation protocol to address this issue and is funding research to better understand and manage seismic activity.

The growing interest in geothermal energy has attracted significant investment from startups in the US and Canada. Companies like Fervo Energy have raised hundreds of millions of dollars to develop geothermal projects. Fervo Energy, in collaboration with Google, has connected its Nevada site to the electric grid. While the site currently generates only 3.5 megawatts, the participation of big companies like Google, Microsoft, and Nucor in purchasing geothermal energy indicates a rising demand for this renewable source.

As the geothermal energy sector expands, the need for the first successful commercial facility becomes crucial. Once a company demonstrates the viability and profitability of geothermal energy, it will pave the way for further growth and investment in the industry. Cindy Taff, CEO of Sage Geosystems, emphasizes that the market for geothermal energy is still open and full of potential.

In conclusion, geothermal energy holds promise as a clean and reliable power source for the future. The US government and various businesses are investing in technological advancements to harness geothermal energy effectively. With its scalability, reduced environmental impact, and steady energy flow, geothermal energy has the potential to play a significant role in the transition to a greener future. As the sector continues to grow, it is essential to prioritize responsible and sustainable development to ensure long-term success.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/a-worker-operates-a-dr.jpg,2024-03-25 04:59:03,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2024/03/25/amid-fintech-slowdown-goldman-sachs-backed-startup-considers-sale-sources-say/,"Amid Fintech Slowdown, Goldman Sachs-Backed Startup Considers Sale","Deserve, a 10-year-old Silicon Valley startup that assists companies in launching and managing credit cards, is facing challenges due to a slowdown in business and a dry funding market. The company, which was valued at $500 million in 2021, is backed by prominent investors such as Goldman Sachs, Visa, Mastercard, and Accel. Deserve has reportedly explored the possibility of selling itself and has attracted interest from larger businesses. However, the company's founder and CEO, Kalpesh Kapadia, has stated that Deserve is not for sale and is focused on strategic discussions around partnerships, investments, and mergers and acquisitions.

Since its founding in 2013, Deserve has raised $150 million in equity funding but has not yet achieved profitability. It is estimated that the company burned through $15 million to $20 million in 2023. Kapadia is optimistic about Deserve's future growth, expecting a reduced burn rate and renewed growth in 2024. Deserve aims to build a self-sustaining, profitable business with a full sales pipeline of banks, fintechs, and brand partners.

Industry insiders believe that if Deserve is sold, it will likely fetch a price significantly lower than its peak 2021 valuation. The overall valuation of fintech companies has decreased, and Deserve faced additional challenges when its largest customer, crypto lender BlockFi, went bankrupt. Deserve had planned to work with crypto lenders to issue credit cards, but BlockFi's collapse affected the company's revenue.

Kalpesh Kapadia, who came to the U.S. from India in the mid-1990s, founded Deserve after working in finance as an investment banking analyst and hedge fund manager. His initial vision was to create a consumer credit card company that catered to immigrants and students, making credit more accessible to underserved populations. Deserve launched its first card in 2016 with backing from venture firms like Accel and Aspect Ventures. The company initially funded loans through its own balance sheet with a line of credit from Credit Suisse.

However, consumer lending is a challenging and capital-intensive industry to enter, especially when taking on financial risk. In 2018, Deserve pivoted its business model after being approached by student loan bank Sallie Mae, which wanted to launch its own credit card. This shift allowed Deserve to assist other companies in launching credit cards, making the process more streamlined and accessible for customers. Sallie Mae became Deserve's first customer.

Deserve's services include assessing borrower risk, processing transactions, handling customer service calls, and managing disputes. In addition to launching credit cards for other companies, Deserve also maintained its original consumer card business, collecting fees and interest income. However, the company stopped acquiring new customers in this segment.

Deserve experienced significant interest and demand for its services, particularly from bitcoin companies, in early 2021. The company helped crypto lender BlockFi launch a rewards card, which became its largest customer. Unfortunately, BlockFi's collapse and subsequent bankruptcy in November 2022 had a substantial impact on Deserve's revenue.

As interest rates rose and the startup funding market became more challenging, Deserve faced further difficulties as its fintech customers struggled to survive. For example, GloriFi, a digital bank that partnered with Deserve to release a credit card, shut down shortly after its launch. This trend of struggling startups has affected many fintech companies, including industry pioneer Plaid. Currently, Deserve serves 15 customers, half of which are fintech companies like investing app M1, and the other half are banks.

Competition in the tech-enabled credit card issuing space has intensified over the past year. In January 2023, payments company Marqeta announced its plans to acquire Power Finance, an early-stage credit card issuing platform. This heightened competition poses a challenge to Deserve and other players in the industry.

In conclusion, Deserve, a startup specializing in helping companies launch and manage credit cards, is facing challenges due to a slowdown in business and a tough funding market. Despite exploring the possibility of selling itself, Deserve's founder and CEO has stated that the company is not for sale and remains focused on strategic discussions. Deserve has experienced setbacks, including the bankruptcy of its largest customer, BlockFi, and the struggles of its fintech customers. However, the company continues to serve a range of customers and is optimistic about its future growth.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600d053afe6bed0f9b925c9/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 11:57:06,Innovation,Innovation

As someone who was initially disappointed with its rocky launch, I can confidently say that Cyberpunk 2077 has become one of my all-time favorite games. It has surpassed my expectations and is now my preferred story-driven RPG, featuring captivating NPCs and engrossing questlines. The combat mechanics are a blast, regardless of the character build you choose, especially with the game's revamped skill tree and Cyberware system introduced in the latest major update.

Speaking of visuals, Cyberpunk 2077 is a masterpiece, particularly on PC. With its path tracing settings, which were added post-launch, the game boasts stunning graphics that are unmatched in the industry. However, it's worth noting that you'll need a powerful PC to fully appreciate this level of visual fidelity. Thankfully, the game has come a long way from its initial launch on PS4, where it faced significant performance issues that led to Sony issuing refunds to dissatisfied players. Rest assured, this free trial is exclusive to consoles and not available on PC.

As the game's release date for the free trial approaches, I have an exciting special feature planned in collaboration with CDPR. So, be sure to stay tuned for that! I cannot emphasize enough how strongly I recommend Cyberpunk 2077 to anyone who hasn't had the chance to play it in the past three years. Despite its tumultuous launch, the game has been transformed into a remarkable experience that ranks among the best I've ever had. I only wish I could erase my memory and experience it again for the first time, now that it has been refined, upgraded, and polished to perfection.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/25/in-photos-worm-moon-lunar-eclipse-sets-up-total-solar-eclipse/,In Photos: ‘Worm Moon Lunar Eclipse’ Sets Up Total Solar Eclipse,"The full moon of March, known as the ""Worm Moon,"" made its appearance on Sunday night and continued into Monday, partially eclipsed in certain parts of the world. This lunar event sets the stage for a total solar eclipse in North America on April 8, coinciding with the next new moon.

While the third full moon of 2024 and the first of spring in the northern hemisphere were visible across the globe, the partial lunar eclipse could only be witnessed from the night side of the planet in specific regions, including North and South America, Europe, East Asia, Australia, and New Zealand.

During the eclipse, Earth partially obstructed the sun when viewed from the moon.

Here are some of the most stunning images captured during the full moon and partial lunar eclipse:

A lunar eclipse occurs exclusively during a full moon when the moon enters Earth's shadow, a phenomenon that only occurs when the moon is on the opposite side of the Earth from the sun.

On Monday morning, a penumbral lunar eclipse took place, where the moon passed through Earth's penumbra, the outer and lighter shadow cast by our planet in space.

The entire journey through the penumbra lasted precisely 4 hours and 39 minutes, resulting in a mesmerizing visual display.

Unlike a ""Blood Moon,"" where the moon traverses through Earth's umbra and appears reddish due to sunlight refracted by our atmosphere, this penumbral lunar eclipse showcased Earth's shadow gradually moving across the lunar surface, softly dimming the sunlight's effect.

Throughout the event, the backdrop of the stars in the constellation Virgo accompanied the moon. Notably, the prominent star Spica positioned itself to the lower left of the moon, while the brightest star in the Scorpius constellation, Antares, shone high to the moon's upper right. Over the following two nights, the moon would draw closer to Spica, creating a captivating celestial sight.

As is customary for full moons, the ""Worm Moon"" remained visible throughout the night, rising in the east during sunset and setting in the west at sunrise. This particular nickname originates from the emergence of beetle larvae from thawing tree bark during the spring season, according to Almanac.

The upcoming new moon, scheduled for April 8, will be a ""supermoon"" and appear larger than usual. It will seemingly cross the sun's path, resulting in a partial solar eclipse visible in North America. The total solar eclipse, lasting up to 4 minutes and 26 seconds, will only be visible within a 115-mile wide path of totality.

This path will stretch from the Pacific coast of northwestern Mexico to Atlantic Canada, passing through 15 U.S. states: Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. Those outside this path will witness a partial solar eclipse.

It is worth noting that a total solar eclipse occurs, on average, only once every 366 years. However, North America has the privilege of experiencing two total solar eclipses within a span of just seven years, with the last one occurring on August 21, 2017.

Following the ""Worm Moon"" and the total solar eclipse, the next full moon will be the ""Pink Moon,"" set to appear at 23:48 UTC/7:48 p.m. EDT on April 23. This will mark the fourth full moon of 2024.

May you always have clear skies and captivating celestial encounters.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6601aa9bc397763ceaf0c79a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1566,881,x217,y217,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 12:57:41,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/webroot/2024/03/25/7-cyber-safety-tips-to-outsmart-scammers/,7 Cyber Safety Tips To Outsmart Scammers,"Welcome to the wild west of the digital world, where cyber scammers lurk around every pixelated corner. Cybercrime is not just a futuristic Hollywood plotline; it is a real threat that targets everyone, from wide-eyed kids to seasoned adults and wise grandparents. And guess what? It is on the rise faster than your Wi-Fi connection during peak hours. So, hoist the sails as we cruise through the seven seas of cyber safety.

Before we dive headfirst into the cyber safety tips, let us equip ourselves with the ultimate weapon: knowledge. Scams are the digital equivalent of a snake oil salesperson peddling miracle cures. They come in all shapes and sizes, lurking in the shadowy corners of the internet. Let us embrace the golden rule of scam detection: skepticism.

Whether it is a promise of untold riches, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, or a free Caribbean cruise courtesy of a Nigerian prince, approach with caution and a healthy dose of skepticism. Now, let us take a quick tour through the terrain of common cyber scams:

Phishing scams: Ah, phishing scams, the bane of our digital existence. These sneaky scams involve fake emails posing as messages from familiar faces or reputable companies. They will try to sweet-talk you into clicking on suspicious links or divulging sensitive information like passwords or credit card details. Remember: real companies do not ask for your personal data via email.

Sweepstakes and awards scams: Congratulations! You have just won a brand new car, a tropical vacation, and a lifetime supply of unicorn-shaped cookies—all you need to do is pay a small processing fee. Sound too good to be true? That is because it is! These scams offer you instant wealth but are really just clever ruses to empty your wallet faster than you can say ""jackpot.""

Investment scams: Picture this: a golden opportunity to double your money with zero risk. Investment scams lure unsuspecting victims with the promise of sky-high profits. Do not let these offers cloud your judgment. Always do your due diligence before investing your hard-earned cash.

Lawsuit or tax scams: Lawsuit and tax scams thrive on instilling fear and panic, claiming you owe urgent payments. When in doubt, verify the legitimacy of any claims before reaching for your wallet.

Romance scams: Romance scams prey on the trusting hearts of hopeful romantics, weaving elaborate tales of love and devotion before swooping in for the financial kill. Remember: anyone who asks for money online is more likely to break your heart than mend it.

Tech support scams: These impostors offer remote assistance to fix nonexistent problems with your laptop or devices while gaining access to your sensitive data. Remember: legitimate tech support does not come knocking unsolicited. If in doubt, just delete the email and seek help from trusted sources.

Armed with this knowledge, you are ready to navigate the digital minefield with confidence. You can also be a good internet citizen by forwarding these scams to the U.S. government's Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) at phishing-report@us-cert.gov.

Now, let us move on to seven tips to stay safe online:

1. Use strong passwords: Let us kick things off with the basics. Your password is the digital key to your castle, so make sure it is not something as flimsy as '123456' or 'password.' Get creative! Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters like a mad scientist concocting a secret potion. And do not reuse passwords across multiple accounts unless you want to throw a welcome party for cybercriminals.

2. Enable two-factor authentication: Adding an extra layer of security to your online accounts is as easy as enabling two-factor authentication (2FA). This means you will need to provide a second piece of information, such as a unique code sent to your phone, in addition to your password. It is like having a guard dog at the gate of your digital kingdom.

3. Keep your software up to date: You know those annoying software update notifications? They are actually your digital knights in shining armor, protecting you from the latest vulnerabilities. So, do not ignore them. Keep your operating system, antivirus software, and all other applications up to date to ensure you have the latest security patches.

4. Be cautious with links and attachments: Just like you would not blindly open a package from a stranger, do not click on suspicious links or download attachments from unknown sources. Hover over links to check their destination before clicking, and use your common sense. If something seems fishy, it probably is.

5. Beware of public Wi-Fi: Public Wi-Fi may be convenient, but it is also a playground for cybercriminals. Avoid accessing sensitive information, such as online banking or shopping, while connected to public Wi-Fi networks. If you must use public Wi-Fi, consider using a virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt your connection and protect your data.

6. Be mindful of what you share on social media: The allure of social media is undeniable, but oversharing can come back to haunt you. Be cautious about the personal information you share online, such as your address, phone number, or vacation plans. Remember, once something is out there, it is out there for good.

7. Educate yourself and others: Knowledge is power, and the more you know about cyber threats, the better equipped you are to protect yourself. Stay informed about the latest scams and share your knowledge with friends and family. Together, we can create a safer digital world.

In conclusion, the wild west of the digital world may be treacherous, but with the right knowledge and precautions, you can navigate it safely. Stay vigilant, be skeptical, and follow these tips to protect yourself from cyber scammers. Remember, you are the sheriff of your own digital town, and it is up to you to keep it safe. Happy surfing!

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/spotify-throws-its-hat-in-the-edtech-ring/,Spotify throws its hat in the edtech ring,"Welcome back to Equity, the podcast that delves into the business of startups and unpacks the numbers and nuances behind the headlines. In this episode, we've got a lot of ground to cover, so let's dive right in!

Stocks around the world are currently experiencing a retreat, but the crypto market is looking pretty good with some recent gains. However, the biggest news in the startup world today is the exit of Stability AI's CEO. This move is significant because the company's revenue growth and burn rate have been the subject of much discussion before.

Meanwhile, over in the European Union, several U.S.-based tech companies are facing inquiries due to the new Digital Markets Act. It's worth pondering whether these tech giants will be able to establish a better working relationship with the bloc in the future.

Shifting our focus to Europe, Spotify is making another non-musical effort, and I have a few thoughts on that. Additionally, we discussed some news from China, where the country is set to introduce the Vision Pro next and is actively working towards removing Intel and AMD chips from state computers. Lastly, we closed the show with a report on how beverage startups are fighting against industry giants like Coke and Pepsi for market share.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/match-board-directors-after-talks-activist-investor-elliott-management/,Match appoints two board directors after talks with activist investor Elliott Management,"Tinder-owner Match Group has made some significant announcements recently. They have appointed two new members to their board of directors and have signed an agreement with Elliott Management, an activist investor. Laura Jones, the chief marketing officer at Instacart, and Spencer Rascoff, the co-founder of Zillow, will be joining Match Group's board effective immediately.

According to Match Group, these appointments are a result of a ""constructive dialogue"" with Elliott Management, and the two companies have entered into an ""information-sharing"" agreement. This news comes a few months after it was reported by the Wall Street Journal that Elliott Management had acquired a $1 billion stake in Match Group. The report suggested that Elliott was interested in discussing ways for Match Group to improve its performance, as the company has been experiencing a decline in paying users due to economic uncertainty.

Marc Steinberg, a partner at Elliott Management, expressed his confidence in Match Group's potential for value creation as the global leader in online dating. He also praised the collaboration with management and the board and stated that Laura Jones and Spencer Rascoff would be valuable additions to the board, bringing their unique skills and perspectives to support the company's growth in the future.

Elliott Management has gained a reputation for acquiring stakes in technology companies and pushing for changes. Their push for change at Match Group follows similar efforts at Crown Castle and Etsy, where they successfully influenced board shakeups.

In Match Group's fourth quarter for 2023, the company experienced a 5% decrease in the number of total paid users compared to the previous year, with a total of 15.2 million paid users. The company's growth has slowed down from the peak it reached during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a 79% decline in its stock since its peak in 2021.

It's important to note that Match Group is the parent company of various popular dating apps, including Tinder, Hinge, Match.com, Meetic, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, OurTime, and more.

These recent developments indicate that Match Group is actively seeking ways to improve its performance and regain its growth momentum. With the addition of Laura Jones and Spencer Rascoff to the board, the company aims to leverage their expertise and perspectives to navigate its next phase of growth successfully. As the global leader in online dating, Match Group remains optimistic about its potential for value creation and is committed to delivering a positive experience for its users across its diverse portfolio of dating apps.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1241790742.jpeg?w=1024,2024-03-25 14:15:04,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/gostudent-tutoring-profitability/,"GoStudent, the online learning platform, says it's now profitable","GoStudent, the Austrian online tutoring marketplace, has achieved profitability, marking a significant milestone for the company. With a valuation of $3.2 billion, GoStudent has established itself as one of Vienna's most successful startups, boasting 11 million families and 23,000 tutors on its platform. CEO Felix Ohswald revealed that the company is now operating in the black globally, with positive EBITDA and operating cashflow.

However, GoStudent's path to profitability was not without challenges. Like many technology companies, it faced a market crash during the boom of online learning and remote experiences. As customer demand dropped, GoStudent lost €89 million in 2021 and €220 million in 2022. This led to significant layoffs and cost-cutting measures.

GoStudent experienced rapid growth from 2019 to 2022, generating over €100 million in revenue. But the company also burned through €150 million in cash in 2022 alone. Recognizing the need for change, GoStudent reduced its burn rate by 70% in 2023. Despite raising substantial funding, the company had to make tough decisions, including multiple rounds of layoffs.

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the digital transformation in education, benefiting edtech companies like GoStudent. The company transitioned from convincing parents about the merits of online tutoring to becoming the go-to solution for students in need of academic support.

To address its financial challenges, GoStudent made various cuts, including eliminating extravagant parties, pausing acquisitions, and refraining from expanding into new markets. It also made the difficult decision to exit the highly competitive U.S. market after a short period. The company now focuses on Europe and adopts an organic growth strategy outside of German-speaking countries.

GoStudent's mission is to build the leading global school and unlock every student's potential through personalized tutoring. While scaling at lower costs presents challenges, the company aims to strike a balance between growth and maintaining a personalized approach. Its acquisition of StudienKreis in 2022, a company with physical learning centers, allows GoStudent to explore hybrid learning opportunities.

CEO Felix Ohswald believes that the future of education is hybrid, combining technology with physical learning centers. GoStudent's ability to leverage technology to connect students with the right tutors, regardless of location, sets it apart. Most of GoStudent's tutors are university students, making it easier for them to connect with pupils while providing quality education.

In conclusion, GoStudent's journey to profitability showcases its resilience and adaptability in the face of challenges. By making strategic changes and focusing on its core business, the company has positioned itself for continued success in the online tutoring market. With its commitment to personalized education and hybrid learning, GoStudent aims to revolutionize the way students learn and achieve their full potential.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Founders-of-GoStudent-Gregor-Muller-I-Felix-Ohswald-2.jpg?w=1024,2024-03-25 11:00:36,Innovation,Innovation
