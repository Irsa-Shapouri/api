https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-vulnerability-virtual-reality.html,Vulnerability in virtual reality systems identified,"Virtual reality (VR) systems have opened up a whole new world of possibilities, allowing users to immerse themselves in a virtual environment that seems almost real. However, a team of computer scientists from the University of Chicago has recently discovered a potential vulnerability in these VR systems that could put users at risk.

The team has identified a way for hackers to insert what they call an ""inception layer"" between a user's VR Home Screen and their VR User/Server. This means that users may unknowingly interact with a simulated VR app created by the attacker, rather than the app they intended to use. The researchers have outlined their findings in a paper published on the arXiv preprint server.

Imagine a scenario where a hacker adds an app to a user's VR headset that tricks them into revealing sensitive information. This is exactly what the research team envisioned. The app would create a layer of reality between the user and the virtual world they see through their VR device. Drawing inspiration from the movie ""Inception,"" where characters have altered realities downloaded into their brains, the researchers called this layer the ""inception layer.""

The potential consequences of this vulnerability are alarming. The app could record sensitive information, such as passcodes entered into a virtual ATM, or intercept and alter financial transactions, routing the difference to the hacker's bank account. Moreover, it could manipulate the VR world by adding characters that appear to be friends or family, using this deception to gain trust and access to secrets. Essentially, the app could monitor and manipulate gestures, voice interactions, browsing activity, and social or business interactions within the VR environment.

To demonstrate the feasibility of this attack, the research team conducted an experiment. They enlisted 28 volunteers who played a game using a demonstration VR headset. The researchers then downloaded an app onto the devices, simulating a hacking scenario. Only 10 of the volunteers noticed a slight flickering during the download and activation process, and just one of them questioned whether something nefarious was happening.

Upon discovering this vulnerability, the research team promptly informed Meta, the company behind the Meta Quest VR system used in the experiment. Meta acknowledged the findings and expressed their intention to investigate and address the issue if confirmed. The researchers also believe that similar vulnerabilities may exist in other VR systems and apps that attempt to insert themselves between users and their VR devices.

This discovery highlights the importance of addressing potential security threats in VR systems. As the popularity and widespread use of VR continues to grow, it is essential to ensure that users are protected from potential attacks. By addressing these vulnerabilities, we can ensure that VR remains a safe and enjoyable experience for all users.

In conclusion, the team of computer scientists from the University of Chicago has uncovered a potential vulnerability in VR systems, which they refer to as ""inception attacks."" These attacks involve the insertion of an inception layer between a user's VR Home Screen and their VR User/Server. This layer can be used by hackers to record sensitive information, manipulate transactions, and deceive users within the VR environment. The research team has alerted Meta, the makers of the Meta Quest VR system, about their findings, and they plan to investigate and address the issue. It is crucial for the VR industry as a whole to be aware of potential vulnerabilities and take steps to protect users from such attacks.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/vulnerability-in-virtu.jpg,2024-03-25 10:20:02,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.zdnet.com/education/professional-development/want-to-be-a-devops-engineer-heres-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/,"Want to be a DevOps engineer?

Becoming a DevOps engineer does not require formal education. Self-learning is often the best path to pursue a career in this field. DevOps engineers must have a passion for learning and constantly challenging themselves to keep up with the ever-evolving landscape of tools, frameworks, and technologies.

Homebrew Henry, another seasoned DevOps engineer, emphasizes the importance of continuous learning in this field. DevOps engineers must dedicate their free time to studying new concepts and technologies. The DevOps ecosystem is vast and constantly changing, so staying updated is crucial.

Even as one gains experience, learning never stops. The introduction of AI tools like ChatGPT and the rapid pace of development mean that DevOps engineering today will not be the same as it was a few years ago. Embracing this constant evolution is one of the aspects that DevOps engineers find most exciting about their job.

Infrastructure management is a significant part of a DevOps engineer's responsibilities. Those who enjoy managing infrastructure thrive in this role. Setting up, configuring, and maintaining cloud infrastructure, including servers, databases, networks, and security, is a daily task. This aspect of the job can be both challenging and rewarding for individuals who find excitement in it. However, if one's passion lies more in software engineering, the infrastructure management aspect may not provide the same level of fulfillment.

It is worth noting that transitioning between software engineering and DevOps is possible. Many professionals have successfully made this switch, so individuals should not feel limited to one path.

Lastly, it is essential to consider the business side of DevOps. Unrealistic expectations from management can often be a challenge. Businesses may believe that hiring a few DevOps engineers will magically solve all their problems. However, this is not the reality. DevOps is a complex discipline that requires time, effort, and collaboration across the organization to achieve success.

In conclusion, DevOps engineering is a highly rewarding career that requires a combination of technical expertise, continuous learning, and a passion for collaboration. By mastering essential skills such as Linux, bash scripting, and cloud technologies, and by embracing the challenges and opportunities that come with infrastructure management, individuals can thrive in this fast-paced field.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2024/03/26/can-ai-amplify-esprit-de-corps/,Can AI Amplify Esprit De Corps?,"Can AI Bring Us Together?

In the world of sports, data-driven decision-making has become a standard practice. However, this approach has leveled the playing field, as every team now relies on data for recruiting and strategy. So, what can set a team apart from the rest? Back in the 1980s, Dr. Peter Senge conducted a study on the Los Angeles Lakers, one of the most successful basketball teams of the previous decade. He found that the key to their success was a shared vision and alignment among team members. Fast-forward to today, and experts are exploring the idea of using artificial intelligence (AI) to create a common vision and bring teams closer together.

AI has the potential to be a unifying force for teams, but this aspect hasn't received much attention. It is a soft benefit that is difficult to quantify. However, AI can be used to achieve greater alignment and understanding between team members, even if they are not physically in the same location. Dr. Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic, chief innovation officer at ManpowerGroup, refers to this as ""artificial emotional intelligence"" (AEI). AEI involves computers trying to understand human emotions and thoughts, a foundational aspect of human emotional intelligence.

One way AI can enhance team collaboration is by helping team members understand each other's feelings and motivations. Natural language processing can analyze the language used by team members to estimate their morale, engagement, and enthusiasm. This information can be valuable for managers to better understand their team members. Additionally, AI can analyze body language during video meetings to give team members a sense of how others are feeling. Think of it as a ""Shazam for the soul.""

However, AI is still in its early stages when it comes to bringing teams into alignment. Currently, AI applications are more focused on enhancing individual productivity within a team rather than fostering collaboration. Yingqi Wang, CEO and founder of ONES, a project management software provider, compares today's AI usage to ""shadow IT."" AI can assist with time-consuming tasks like notetaking and transcription, or it can provide real-time translation. As AI becomes more widely adopted and reliable, it has the potential to reshape how teams approach tasks and break down barriers to collaboration and communication.

While AI can be a helpful tool, humans should not over-rely on it. Over-automation can diminish human touch and spontaneous collaboration, which are essential for team cohesion. It is crucial to maintain strong people skills and continue to communicate with each other, even as AI becomes more integrated into our workflows. Additionally, over-reliance on data-driven creativity can stifle true innovation, leading to formulaic content or recommended next steps. As AI evolves, it is important to explore its impact on team dynamics and ensure that it enhances collaboration rather than hinders it.

In conclusion, AI has the potential to bring teams together by creating a shared vision and improving understanding between team members. However, AI is still in its early stages when it comes to fostering collaboration. As AI continues to develop, it is important to strike a balance between leveraging its capabilities and maintaining human connection within teams. By doing so, teams can harness the power of AI while preserving the unique qualities that make us human.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66025c981748a83933081202/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-26 01:28:39,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/techcrunch-minute-why-the-company-behind-trumps-truth-social-joined-the-growing-ipo-trend/,Watch: Why the company behind Trump's Truth Social joined the growing IPO trend,"Last week, the Reddit and Astera Labs IPOs made headlines and captured the attention of the media.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/christianmiller/2024/03/25/getting-more-impatient-when-the-end-is-in-sight-taylor-swifts-new-album-covid-vaccines-and-the-2020-presidential-election/,Getting More Impatient When the End Is in Sight,"Taylor Swift's highly anticipated new album, The Tortured Poets Department, is just around the corner, and fans are eagerly awaiting its release. But as the big day approaches, emotions are running high. Are you feeling more impatient? Or maybe your impatience has remained constant? Perhaps you're even starting to feel a sense of relief as the wait comes to an end.

A recent study conducted by Annabelle Roberts at the University of Texas and Ayelet Fishbach at the University of Chicago sheds light on this phenomenon. They found that people tend to become more impatient as the end of a wait draws near, not necessarily because of the time and energy they've already invested, but because they long for closure.

In one of their studies, the researchers focused on the COVID-19 pandemic and the release of vaccines in the U.S. They surveyed 161 participants at three different time points: after the successful Pfizer trial announcement, in November and December 2020, and in March 2021. Participants were asked to rate their level of impatience to get a coronavirus vaccine and for the pandemic to end. Interestingly, while impatience for the vaccine increased over time, impatience for the pandemic to end remained relatively stable. This suggests that the proximity to the end of the wait was the driving factor behind the increased impatience.

Another study conducted by Roberts and Fishbach looked at the 2020 U.S. presidential race between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. They surveyed 215 participants in the days leading up to Election Day, November 3rd, and included an extra day in their data set since the results were not settled until November 4th. The findings showed that impatience grew as the election drew nearer, regardless of whether participants supported Biden or Trump. Again, this supports the idea that people crave closure.

The researchers also explored impatience in everyday scenarios, such as waiting for a bus, receiving a package, tracking a delivery truck, or encountering a traffic delay. In each case, impatience increased as the remaining time decreased. It wasn't the total wait time that mattered; it was the time left until the desired event or outcome.

These findings have practical implications. For instance, those responsible for managing situations, such as government officials, nurses, or customer service representatives, should inform people about delays early on and provide overestimated wait times rather than underestimate them. Additionally, individuals can plan ahead for anticipated events to help cope with the surge in impatience. Engaging in activities like reading or listening to podcasts can distract from the impatience and make the wait more bearable.

So, for all the Swifties eagerly awaiting Taylor Swift's new album, prepare for your impatience to intensify as the release date, April 19th, draws near. But take heart, because soon you'll have the closure you've been longing for.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65f253e5f8f81a9d16371132/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1350,759,x0,y0,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 20:53:11,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/large-language-models-can-help-home-robots-recover-from-errors-without-human-help/,Large language models can help home robots recover from errors without human help,"Home robots have struggled to gain widespread popularity due to various factors such as pricing, practicality, form factor, and mapping. But even when these issues are addressed, there is still the challenge of dealing with inevitable mistakes. This problem is not exclusive to home robots; even on an industrial level, companies face difficulties in addressing mistakes. However, unlike big companies, consumers cannot be expected to learn programming or hire someone to help them every time an issue arises. This is where large language models (LLMs) can be useful in the robotics space, as demonstrated by recent research from MIT.

A study, which will be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) in May, aims to bring ""common sense"" into the process of correcting mistakes. The researchers at MIT explain that robots are excellent mimics, but without being programmed to handle unexpected situations, they struggle to adapt and continue their tasks. Traditionally, when a robot encounters an issue, it exhausts its pre-programmed options before requiring human intervention. This becomes particularly challenging in unstructured environments like homes, where even small changes can disrupt a robot's functioning.

Imitation learning, which involves learning to perform tasks through observation, is popular in the field of home robotics. However, it often fails to account for the countless small environmental variations that can interfere with regular operation. As a result, the system needs to start from scratch. The new research addresses this problem by breaking demonstrations into smaller subsets instead of treating them as continuous actions.

This is where LLMs come into play, eliminating the need for manual labeling and assignment of subactions by the programmer. LLMs can provide instructions for each step of a task in natural language. The researchers wanted to connect the continuous demonstrations performed by humans with the steps described by LLMs so that a robot would automatically know its progress in a task and be able to replan and recover on its own.

The study features a demonstration in which a robot is trained to scoop marbles and pour them into an empty bowl. While this may seem like a simple task for humans, it involves a combination of various small tasks for robots. The LLMs can list and label these subtasks. During the demonstrations, the researchers purposely sabotaged the activity by bumping the robot off course and knocking marbles out of its spoon. However, instead of starting from scratch, the system was able to self-correct the small tasks.

""With our method, when the robot is making mistakes, we don’t need to ask humans to program or give extra demonstrations of how to recover from failures,"" explains grad student Tsun-Hsuan Wang.

This research presents a compelling approach to preventing robots from losing their marbles. By utilizing large language models and breaking tasks into smaller subsets, robots can better handle mistakes and continue their tasks without human intervention. This advancement in robotics has the potential to improve the functionality and reliability of home robots, making them more practical and user-friendly for consumers.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/CommonSense-01-press_0.jpg?w=900,2024-03-25 20:01:06,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.zdnet.com/article/five-linux-file-and-folder-management-commands-you-need-to-know/,Five Linux file and folder management commands you need to know,"Linux is a versatile operating system with a wide range of commands that users can utilize for various tasks. While there are over 1,000 basic commands, this number significantly increases when you migrate to the desktop environment. For instance, on Pop!_OS, there are 1,615 commands in /usr/bin and 609 in /usr/sbin, totaling more than 2,000 commands to choose from.

However, throughout your experience with Linux, you will likely only use a small percentage of these commands. This is particularly true when it comes to file and folder management, as the number of commands required for these tasks is relatively limited.

In a previous article, I listed the essential five Linux commands for file and folder management that every user should learn. These commands are an excellent starting point for beginners. However, there are additional commands that can further enhance your Linux skills. In this article, I will introduce you to the next five Linux commands that you should learn.

1. mkdir
The mkdir command allows you to create a new directory, also known as a ""folder."" To use this command, simply type ""mkdir"" followed by the name of the folder you wish to create. For example, if you want to create a folder named ""FOLDER,"" the command would be:
mkdir FOLDER

This command will create a new folder within the directory you are currently working in. Suppose you are in the ""~/Documents"" directory and want to create a folder named ""TEST"" in the root of your home directory. In that case, you can run the following command:
mkdir ~/TEST

But what if you want to create ""~/TEST/project1"" but haven't created the ""TEST"" folder yet? In such cases, you can use the ""-p"" option to create nested directories. For example:
mkdir -p ~/TEST/project1

This command will first create the ""TEST"" folder and then create the ""project1"" folder inside it.

2. less
The less command is used to view the contents of a file. It is particularly useful when you want to view large files without overwhelming your terminal. To use this command, simply type ""less"" followed by the path to the file you want to view. For example, if you want to view the contents of ""/etc/samba/smb.conf,"" the command would be:
less /etc/samba/smb.conf

What sets less apart is that it displays the file one page at a time, allowing you to scroll through it and view it line by line. This feature is beneficial when you only need to view the file and don't require any editing.

3. cat
The cat command is used for concatenating files and displaying their contents in the terminal. Unlike less, you cannot scroll through the output of cat unless your terminal window supports it. To view the contents of a file using cat, simply type ""cat"" followed by the path to the file. For example, to view the contents of ""/etc/fstab,"" you can use the following command:
cat /etc/fstab

Additionally, cat is useful for appending the content of one file to another. Suppose you have two files, ""file1.txt"" and ""file2.txt,"" located in ""TEST/project1."" If you want to append the content of ""file1.txt"" to the end of ""file2.txt,"" you can use the following command:
cat TEST/project1/file1.txt >> TEST/project1/file2.txt

This command will append the content of ""file1.txt"" to the end of ""file2.txt.""

4. touch
The touch command is simple yet essential. It allows you to create an empty file. To create a file using touch, simply type ""touch"" followed by the desired filename. For example:
touch filename

Although touch's primary purpose is to change file timestamps, most users employ it to create empty files. Here's an example of how it works:
1. Create an empty file: touch ~/test
2. Add content to the new file: echo ""New Content"" > ~/test
3. Append more content to the file: echo ""More Content"" >> ~/test

It's important to note the difference between the "">"" and "">>"" operators. The "">"" operator overwrites the content in the file, while "">>"" appends the new text to the end of the file.

5. pwd
While the cd command allows you to navigate the Linux filesystem hierarchy, there may come a time when you need to know your current directory, and the terminal does not provide any clues. This is where the pwd command comes in handy. Pwd stands for ""print working directory"" and displays the name of the current working directory. For example, if you are in ""/var/www/html/site1"" and you issue the command ""pwd,"" you will see ""/var/www/html/site1"" printed out. Although you may not need to use pwd frequently, it is a helpful command to determine your current location when necessary.

By familiarizing yourself with these five additional Linux commands, you will have a solid foundation for efficient file and folder management. Combine these commands with the previous five I mentioned in my previous article, and you will be well-equipped to navigate the Linux environment.

In conclusion, Linux offers a vast array of commands, and while it can be overwhelming, learning a few essential commands can significantly enhance your productivity. Whether you need to create directories, view file contents, concatenate files, create empty files, or determine your current directory, these commands will serve as valuable tools in your Linux journey. So, embrace the power of Linux and master these commands to unlock its full potential.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/73a6f654a7f5dd5cfc8e3389ab98f6a3dc1aafce/2024/03/25/49237a5b-9c57-4f0a-b810-21a85165bfeb/5penguinsflyinggettyimages-520459992.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-semiconductors-scale-processor-remarkable-speedup.html,Semiconductors at scale: New processor achieves remarkable speedup in problem solving,"Annealing processors are specialized for solving combinatorial optimization problems and have applications in various fields such as logistics, resource allocation, and drug discovery. The scalability of these processors is directly influenced by the complexity of their coupling.

In a recent study led by Professor Takayuki Kawahara from Tokyo University of Science, researchers have successfully developed and tested a scalable annealing processor. This processor divides the calculation into multiple LSI chips, allowing for larger-scale systems. The team presented their innovation at the IEEE 22nd World Symposium on Applied Machine Intelligence and Informatics (SAMI 2024) on January 25, 2024.

Prof. Kawahara explains that their goal is to achieve advanced information processing directly at the edge, without relying on the cloud. In 2020, Tokyo University of Science introduced a unique processing architecture that enabled the creation of a fully coupled LSI on a single chip using 28nm CMOS technology. They also developed a scalable method with parallel-operating chips and demonstrated its feasibility using FPGAs in 2022.

The scalable annealing processor developed by the team consists of 36 22nm CMOS calculation LSI chips and one control FPGA. This technology allows for the construction of large-scale, fully coupled semiconductor systems based on the Ising model with 4096 spins. The processor incorporates two technologies developed at Tokyo University of Science: the ""spin thread method"" that enables 8 parallel solution searches, and a technique that reduces chip requirements by about half compared to conventional methods. It operates at a modest power consumption of 2.9W (1.3W for the core part) and operates at 10MHz.

In terms of power performance ratio, the processor outperforms simulating a fully coupled Ising system on a PC using annealing emulation by 2,306 times. It also surpasses the core CPU and arithmetic chip by 2,186 times. This successful machine verification suggests the potential for enhanced capacity.

Prof. Kawahara envisions the social implementation of this technology, including initiating business ventures, joint research efforts, and technology transfer. The team aims to develop this technology further to achieve an LSI system with the computing power of a 2050-level quantum computer for solving combinatorial optimization problems. They aim to achieve this using current semiconductor processes without requiring additional infrastructure.

In conclusion, the researchers have developed a scalable annealing processor with 4096 spins on a single board using 36 CMOS chips. Key innovations, such as chip reduction and parallel operations for simultaneous solution searches, have played a crucial role in this development. The successful machine verification opens up possibilities for future advancements and the creation of new digital industries.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/semiconductors-at-scal.jpg,2024-03-25 13:50:03,Innovation,Innovation

Have you ever experienced the thrill of dressing up as a famous character for Halloween? If so, you may have caught a glimpse of the excitement that comes with embodying someone else, even if it's just for one night. But for some individuals, dressing up as fictional characters is more than just a once-a-year event - it's a way of life. Welcome to the world of cosplay, a vibrant subculture where people don elaborate costumes, embrace fictional personas, and transform themselves into their favorite characters.

Cosplay, short for ""costume play,"" involves individuals dressing up as characters from various forms of media, including comic books, anime, manga, video games, movies, and television shows. It's an opportunity for fans to immerse themselves in the worlds of their beloved franchises and express their passion for these fictional universes. From superheroes like Superman, Batman, and Spider-Man, to iconic characters from Disney, Harry Potter, and Star Wars - the possibilities are endless.

But cosplay is more than just putting on a costume. It's about meticulous attention to detail, from recreating the costumes and hairstyles to mastering the makeup and accessories. Cosplayers strive for accuracy and authenticity, aiming to bring their chosen characters to life. It's not just about the physical appearance; it's about embodying the personality, mannerisms, and unique traits of the character being portrayed.

So why do people cosplay? Research has shown that there are three main reasons behind this passionate pursuit.

Firstly, cosplay provides a platform for creative self-expression. Authentic self-expression has been linked to greater life satisfaction, and cosplay allows individuals to celebrate their favorite fandoms and express their love for fictional characters and stories. For many cosplayers, it's a means of exploring different facets of their identity. By embodying different characters, they can experiment with personas and aspects of themselves that they may not feel comfortable expressing in their everyday lives.

A study published in the journal Fashion Theory in 2015 examined the cosplay subculture in Hong Kong and highlighted the role of identity transformation in pursuing cosplay. Cosplay allows enthusiasts to momentarily change their identity, creating an exciting and contented self. It's a chance to be a superhero, a performer, or even recapture the innocence of childhood. Cosplaying empowers individuals by allowing them to choose their identity and take on new roles, boosting their confidence and fulfilling their dreams.

Secondly, cosplay offers an escape from reality. In a world filled with stress and uncertainty, stepping into the shoes of a beloved character provides a temporary reprieve. Cosplayers can transcend the confines of their everyday lives and become anyone or anything they desire. It's a chance to experience adventure, excitement, wonder, and popularity that may be lacking in their mundane routines.

A study conducted in 2018 found that one of the strongest motivations for engaging in cosplay is the desire to escape from everyday life. By immersing themselves in their favorite fantastical worlds, cosplayers can fulfill dreams, pleasures, romances, and fantasies that may not be achievable in reality. For a brief moment, they can feel like stars or celebrities, recognized, photographed, and admired. Cosplay becomes not just a hobby, but a form of performance and exhibition that satisfies the longing for recognition and appreciation.

Lastly, cosplay fosters a sense of community. Apart from escaping reality, a fundamental motivation behind cosplaying is the need for belongingness. Conventions and gatherings serve as communal spaces where cosplayers can come together, share their passion, and forge lasting friendships. These events provide a platform for cosplayers to connect with like-minded individuals who understand their love for cosplay and the worlds they inhabit. It's a chance to bond over shared interests, exchange tips and tricks, and inspire one another's creativity.

In conclusion, cosplay is more than just a hobby or a form of dress-up. It's a way for individuals to express their creativity, escape from the stresses of everyday life, and connect with a community of like-minded enthusiasts. By donning elaborate costumes and embodying their favorite characters, cosplayers can become the best version of themselves. They embrace self-expression, explore new identities, and find solace and camaraderie in a world that celebrates their passion for all things fictional. So next time you see someone in an incredible costume, remember that behind the mask is a person who has found a unique way to celebrate their favorite stories and become a part of something truly extraordinary.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6601ac3a0b7231e5ced958f7/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2613,1224,x0,y80,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 19:30:41,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-pairing-crypto-green-hydrogen-energy.html,"Pairing crypto mining with green hydrogen offers clean energy boost, study suggests","Pairing cryptocurrency mining, known for its high carbon emissions, with green hydrogen technology could be a key solution for advancing renewable energy, according to a recent study by Cornell University. The study, titled ""Climate Sustainability Through a Dynamic Duo: Green Hydrogen and Crypto Driving Energy Transition and Decarbonization,"" explores the potential of combining energy-intensive cryptocurrency mining with green hydrogen to boost renewable energy sectors.

Cryptocurrency mining operations currently contribute significantly to global carbon emissions. As we strive towards a sustainable and climate-friendly future, it is crucial to find ways to harness the enthusiasm for cryptocurrency while minimizing its environmental impact. Professor Fengqi You, an expert in energy systems engineering at Cornell, emphasizes the importance of exploring opportunities for a more sustainable energy landscape.

The research conducted by Professor You and doctoral student Apoorv Lal highlights the benefits of linking cryptocurrency mining with green hydrogen technology. They refer to this combination as the ""dynamic duo"" that can accelerate the adoption of renewable energy. By using clean energy sources to power blockchain mining operations and produce green hydrogen, we can increase wind and solar capacity and expand sustainable energy production across the country.

The current structure of cryptocurrency mining in the United States alone consumes as much carbon-based energy as the entire country of Argentina, as reported by the White House Office of Science and Technology. The electricity consumption of cryptocurrency mining is driven by computer-intensive consensus mechanisms, known as ""proof of work,"" used to verify crypto-assets. Preliminary estimates from the U.S. Energy Information Administration suggest that cryptocurrency mining could represent 0.6% to 2.3% of all U.S. electricity consumption in 2023.

Acknowledging the substantial energy demands of cryptocurrency mining, Professor You proposes an innovative technology solution. By utilizing cryptocurrencies as virtual energy carriers alongside green hydrogen, we can transform the environmental challenge posed by cryptocurrency into a driving force for climate mitigation and sustainability.

To assess the potential energy strengths of individual U.S. states, Professor You and Lal examined various regions. Their findings indicate that supporting cryptocurrency can expedite the development of additional energy infrastructure. For example, mining one Bitcoin in New Mexico could potentially generate 78.4 megawatt hours of solar power, while mining one Bitcoin in Wyoming could potentially produce 265.8 megawatt hours of wind power.

Cryptocurrency holds an energy value similar to a gift card concept, according to Professor You. It is a virtual asset that can contribute to the energy system. By advancing sustainable practices for blockchain-based cryptocurrency, we can pave the way for a renewable energy transition. However, this endeavor requires stronger federal policies that align with climate goals and promote renewable energy.

By combining cryptocurrency mining with green hydrogen, we not only mitigate the environmental impact of cryptocurrency but also pioneer a sustainable path for renewable energy. This novel strategy, as proposed by Professor You, has the potential to revolutionize the cryptocurrency industry and contribute to a more sustainable and climate-friendly future.

Professor Fengqi You is a senior faculty fellow at the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability, and his expertise in energy systems engineering makes him a key voice in advancing renewable energy solutions. Together with Apoorv Lal, they present a compelling case for the integration of cryptocurrency and green hydrogen technology to drive the energy transition towards a more sustainable future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2023/cryptocurrencies.jpg,2024-03-25 15:00:02,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/london-regtech-gss-raises-47m-to-help-banks-screen-for-global-sanctions/,London regtech GSS raises $47M to help banks screen for global sanctions,"Global Screening Services (GSS), a London-based regulatory compliance platform, has recently secured $47 million in funding. The company specializes in helping financial institutions meet their global sanctions requirements in light of the increasing number of economic sanctions being imposed by countries such as the United States against nations like Russia, China, and Iran.

GSS was founded by Tom Scampion, who previously served as the head of financial crime for Deloitte's EMEA arm. After leaving Deloitte in 2020, Scampion became a general partner at consulting firm AlixPartner, where GSS was initially developed before becoming an independent entity in 2021.

Last year, GSS raised a similar amount of funding from prominent investors, including Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group. The latest funding round saw the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), Cynosure Group, and AlixPartner joining as backers.

Financial institutions, particularly banks, often face challenges in enforcing sanctions due to their role in overseeing global money flows. However, it can be difficult to track and identify the parties involved in financial transactions. For instance, Standard Chartered was fined $1.1 billion in 2019 by U.K. and U.S. regulators for inadequate money-laundering controls and breaching sanctions against countries like Iran. Similarly, BNP Paribas was fined a staggering $8.9 billion several years prior for processing financial transactions for U.S.-sanctioned countries.

The increasing demand for regulatory compliance solutions has led to continued investment in businesses like GSS. For instance, New York-based Droit raised $23 million last year, while London's SteelEye secured $21 million in financing.

GSS offers a sanctions-screening platform to assist financial institutions in meeting regulatory requirements. These institutions input transaction data into GSS's cloud-based platform, which compares the data against a standardized set of sanctions lists from around the world. GSS also enriches these lists with additional data points, including dates of birth, International Maritime Organization (IMO) numbers for ships, and data from the local financial transfer systems of sanctioned countries.

In addition, GSS provides enhanced lists for screening, which include companies with partial ownership by individuals, entities, or governments that have been sanctioned by organizations such as OFAC, the EU, or the U.K.

With the recent funding, GSS is now transitioning from the development phase to full operation, as it prepares to onboard its first customers and go live with its services.

In conclusion, GSS has raised $47 million in funding to further develop its regulatory compliance platform for financial institutions. The company aims to help these institutions meet their global sanctions obligations in an increasingly complex regulatory landscape. With its advanced screening platform and enhanced data lists, GSS is well-positioned to support banks and other financial organizations in ensuring compliance and preventing financial crime.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1770041999-e1711386339681.jpg?resize=1200,677",2024-03-25 18:36:37,Innovation,Innovation
