While I really enjoyed episode 2, the season premiere and last week's episode were disappointing. Episode 3 was just okay, nothing special. With such a short season, each episode carries significant weight.

Now, as we approach the second-to-last episode of the season, I can't help but worry. While it was not as tedious as last week's episode, tonight's episode, titled ""Become,"" was, in a word, preposterous. It was filled with an abundance of ridiculous coincidences and the bad habits that The Walking Dead is known for. I had hoped that we would get back on track this week, but instead, we were presented with a plethora of conveniently contrived plot points because the writers seemingly couldn't come up with anything better.

Spoilers ahead.

Unexpectedly, tonight's episode begins and ends with Gabriel, played by Seth Gilliam. This was a surprising cameo that I did not anticipate. Most people had speculated that the cameo would feature Morgan, played by Lennie James, who embarked on a journey to find Rick after leaving Fear The Walking Dead. Personally, I hope we never see Morgan again. Fear The Walking Dead completely ruined his character, wasting the talents of an exceptional actor season after season. Unfortunately, even on the main show, Morgan wasn't utilized effectively, with his sporadic moments of insanity and the nonsensical catchphrase ""You know what it is!"" It's truly a shame.

Despite my misgivings, I did enjoy the flashback scenes featuring Gabriel and Jadis, portrayed by Pollyanna McIntosh. These scenes built suspense, especially when it was revealed that Jadis had killed a confidante. I genuinely believed that Gabriel would meet his demise. It would have been a bolder move for the series if she had killed him. However, The Walking Dead has become increasingly risk-averse in recent years. Instead, Jadis is the one who meets her end, rambling about choosing sides and who she has become, tying in with the episode's title.

Unfortunately, this episode fell short for me due to its implausibility. Rick and Michonne are on the run and have managed to disappear, their deaths presumed by others. They decide to seek refuge in a cabin in the woods and stumble upon three strangers under attack from zombies that have seemingly turned into stone. I'll refer to these unique zombies as stoners moving forward. Initially, these stoners appear difficult to kill, with their rock-hard skin deflecting bullets. However, Rick and Michonne dispatch them with ease, barely breaking a sweat. This encounter did not result in a tense showdown like the one in ""Nebraska."" Our heroes seemed aware of their own plot armor and swiftly overpowered their adversaries. They then made the questionable decision to trust the survivors, returned their weapons, and even gave them ammunition, all based on a promise to be good. I found this baffling. While it's understandable not to kill them, why would they return their weapons solely on a promise?

Of course, as expected, all three of these individuals meet their demise by the end of the episode. This raises the recurring question: How have these seemingly unintelligent and incapable individuals managed to survive over a decade into the apocalypse? It truly boggles the mind. At this stage, one would expect anyone they encounter to possess the skills and determination of Rick and Michonne. After all, those who have survived this long must be resourceful and proficient in basic survival skills. It's hard to fathom that anyone who has made it this far would lack essential survival abilities unless they resided in a safe zone where survival wasn't a constant struggle, which clearly wasn't the case for these three individuals.

Interestingly, throughout the episode, I half-expected Rick and Michonne to engage in a passionate kiss amidst the chaos of the fight. It seems that they seize every possible opportunity to display their affection for one another. It's quite amusing, to be honest. In the main show, they had very few romantic moments, and now it feels like an endless display of smooching.

But I understand. At this point, it's only natural for them to be more than a little enamored with each other. They are also quite fortunate. Last week, they stumbled upon a fully-functional smart home where they decided to engage in intimate activities while the building was literally crumbling around them! This week, they find solace in the Three Pines Cabin, a cozy retreat where they enjoy candlelight and indulge in alcoholic beverages, creating a fleeting sense of tranquility.

Of course, this respite is short-lived. The following morning, Jadis arrives, guns drawn, abruptly ending their moment of peace. This is where the episode leaves us, with a cliffhanger, eager to see what happens next.

As we eagerly await the finale, it's clear that The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live has had its fair share of hits and misses. This episode, while containing some engaging moments, suffered from implausibility and convenient plot points. However, it's important to remember that each episode plays a significant role in the overall narrative of the show, and hopefully, the finale will tie everything together in a satisfying manner.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600b341eca045b614f49ec5/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=800,450,x0,y41,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 21:39:14,Innovation,Innovation

In this edition, we'll be diving into some exciting fintech startups in Africa, discussing how Copilot has benefited from Mint's closure, and exploring why venture capitalists are showing increased interest in an expense management startup.

Africa's fintech ecosystem has had a successful week, despite the global decline in venture funding. Uber led a $100 million investment in African mobility fintech Moove, pushing the startup's valuation to $750 million. Another notable development is Zone's $8.5 million funding round, which will help scale its decentralized payment infrastructure. Additionally, Tanzanian payments company Nala successfully pivoted to offer remittance services, leading to the creation of a B2B payment platform.

Intuit's decision to shut down budgeting app Mint has opened up opportunities for other startups in the space. Copilot, for example, has experienced significant growth in the past four months, surpassing its growth in the previous four years. This growth enabled the startup to secure a $6 million Series A funding round led by Nico Wittenborn's Adjacent. Mint's closure has also benefited Monarch Money, as customers sought alternative platforms.

While some industries may not be considered ""sexy,"" they can still attract investors. Expense management startup Coast, for instance, targets businesses with real-world field personnel and fleets to manage. The startup saw a 550% revenue growth last year and recently secured $25 million in equity funding. Onyx Private, a digital bank initially aimed at high-earning millennials and Gen Zers, recently pivoted to focus on B2B operations and closed its customers' accounts.

Swiss fintech nsave has raised $4 million in seed funding. The company aims to make banking in Switzerland accessible to individuals in countries with unstable banking sectors or high inflation rates.

In a recent podcast interview, Eric Glyman, co-founder and CEO of Ramp, expressed his belief that the fintech industry, including his own company, is just scratching the surface of its potential. Glyman, whose corporate card and expense startup has achieved unicorn status, believes there is still plenty of room for growth. Fun fact: Both Ramp and Deel celebrated their fifth anniversaries this week.

The U.S. Justice Department's antitrust complaint against Apple targets the company's financial business, particularly its dominance in the market.
