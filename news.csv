Welcome back, Strands players! For those who are unfamiliar, the Strands puzzle is a captivating twist on the classic word search. If you're a fan of Wordle, I like to call you ""Wordlers,"" but we're still searching for a fun term for Strands enthusiasts. ""The Stranded"" has a slightly bleak connotation, but sometimes, when playing this game, I do feel a bit stranded. Perhaps we can dub ourselves ""Stranders""?

Regardless of the name, today's puzzle was quite tricky and took me some time to crack. However, I'm sure there's a segment of the population that will solve it effortlessly. It's all about context, isn't it? Without further ado, let's dive into some additional hints to help you conquer this puzzling Strands challenge!

How to Play Strands

The Strands puzzle, presented by The New York Times, is currently in beta mode. Its continued existence depends on the number of daily players, so let's make sure we keep it alive!

Each day, a new game of Strands awaits you. You'll be presented with a six by eight grid of letters. Your goal is to identify a group of words that share a common theme. Don't worry, you'll receive a clue indicating the nature of the theme. Once you find a theme word, it will be highlighted in blue.

However, there's an additional word you need to find: the spangram. This special word connects two opposite sides of the grid and reveals what the theme words have in common. While the theme words won't be proper names, the spangram might be. When you find the spangram, it will be highlighted in yellow.

What's Today's Strands Hint?

Before we proceed, take a moment to scroll slowly. Just after I provide today's hint for the Strands puzzle, I'll unveil the answer words.

Today's official theme hint for the Strands puzzle is ""Sign language.""

Now, here's an extra hint to nudge you closer to the solution: ""Constellation.""

Unveiling Today's Strands Answers

Spoiler alert! Don't scroll down any further until you're ready to discover today's Strands answers.

First, let's reveal the spangram and locate it on the grid. Then, I'll disclose the remaining words and show you where they fit.

Consider this your final warning!

Today's Strands spangram is . . .

ASTROLOGY

Here's the location of the spangram on the grid:

[Insert grid image with highlighted spangram]

Once you find the spangram, the rest of the day's words should fall into place. However, I must admit that I encountered some difficulty with a couple of these. Here's the complete list:

- Bull
- Goat
- Scorpion
- Virgin
- Archer
- Scales
- Twins

[Insert grid image with highlighted words]

Today's Strands puzzle proved to be quite challenging! Yesterday's puzzle left me perplexed, and today was just as tough. I ended up relying on a few hints, but they didn't provide much assistance. Initially, I found ""Bull"" and then ""Goat."" Oddly enough, this misled me because I thought I was searching for animals. I had no idea how animals related to sign language. I attempted ""Stop,"" but that didn't work. Sometimes, you really have to think outside the box.

Eventually, I discovered ""Virgin,"" which made me even more confused. It wasn't until I stumbled upon ""OLOGY"" that I made any significant progress. At that point, I scoured for words that could precede that fragment. Unfortunately, ""ONTOLOGY"" didn't fit. Finally, I spotted it: astrology. Suddenly, everything fell into place. All the previous words were actually constellations! I found ""Archer"" next, followed by ""Twins,"" and eventually ""Scorpion,"" although the latter gave me quite a hard time.

P.S. Coincidentally, I recently watched the film Taxi Driver after many years, and it was peculiar timing because during a breakfast scene between Travis (Robert DeNiro) and Iris (Jodie Foster), they discuss astrological signs. Life works in mysterious ways!

All's well that ends well, of course. How did you fare with today's Strands puzzle? Share your experience with me on Twitter and Facebook.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) may seem like unlikely parallels, but they share a common thread in their growth trajectories. Both companies stumbled upon their core businesses by chance. AWS discovered that it could monetize the internal services it had developed for its own use, while Nvidia realized that its gaming-focused GPU was well-suited for processing AI workloads.

This realization led to explosive revenue growth for both companies. Nvidia's revenue skyrocketed from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024 to $22.1 billion in Q4 2024, with the majority of the growth coming from its data center business. While AWS didn't experience such rapid growth, it has consistently been a major revenue driver for Amazon. However, as the market has become more competitive, with Microsoft and Google entering the cloud space, it is expected that other chip makers will also gain market share in the future.

The timing was crucial for both companies. As web apps and mobile technology emerged in the early 2010s, the cloud provided on-demand resources that enterprises found valuable for running workloads and building applications. Similarly, the rise of AI and large language models coincided with the increased use of GPUs for processing these workloads.

AWS has grown into a highly profitable business, generating close to $100 billion in revenue annually. However, its growth has started to slow down, while Nvidia's continues to accelerate. This slowdown can be attributed, in part, to the law of large numbers, which will eventually affect Nvidia as well. The question is whether Nvidia can sustain its growth and become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS.

While Nvidia has other businesses to fall back on if the GPU market tightens, these segments are smaller and growing at a slower pace than the data center business. The short-term financial outlook for Nvidia is promising, with revenue expected to reach $24 billion in the current quarter, representing a 234% growth compared to the previous year's first quarter. However, the growth rate is expected to decline as the company's revenue ramps up.

Analysts predict that Nvidia will generate $110.5 billion in revenue for the current fiscal year, an 81% increase from the previous year. Although this is lower than the 126% gain in the previous fiscal year, it still represents significant growth. The company is expected to continue scaling its revenue beyond the $100 billion annual run rate mark for the next several quarters.

AI could be the catalyst for Nvidia's continued growth. Despite increasing competition from AMD, Intel, and other chipmakers, Nvidia currently dominates the market. This dominance gives the company some leeway to withstand competition. However, the landscape may change in the future.

At the chip level, Nvidia maintains a strong position, as shown by IDC's market share data. However, at the board level, AMD is gaining ground, according to Jon Peddie Research. While Nvidia still holds the majority share, AMD's presence is becoming increasingly significant.

In conclusion, Nvidia and AWS have followed similar growth trajectories, driven by accidental discoveries of their core businesses. Nvidia's data center business has fueled its explosive revenue growth, while AWS has been a consistent revenue driver for Amazon. Although AWS's growth has slowed, Nvidia's growth shows no signs of stopping. The future may bring more competition, but Nvidia's current market dominance and focus on AI position it for continued success.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/krisholt/2024/03/24/nyt-connections-hints-and-answers-for-monday-march-25/,"NYT ‘Connections’ Hints And Answers For Monday, March 25","Welcome to today's game of Connections! Are you ready to put your puzzle-solving skills to the test? In this game, you'll be presented with a grid of 16 words, and your goal is to find the links between them and group them accordingly. It's like solving a word puzzle!

Now, before we dive into today's hints and answers, let me give you a quick rundown of how to play. You'll need to arrange the words into four groups of four by identifying the connections between them. These connections could be anything from horror movie franchises to types of verbs or even rappers. Be careful though, as some words might fit into more than one category.

Each group is color coded for your convenience. The yellow group is usually the easiest to figure out, followed by the blue and green groups. The purple group, on the other hand, is known to be the trickiest one, often involving wordplay. So, keep that in mind as you proceed.

To make your guesses, simply select four words that you think go together and hit ""Submit."" If your guess is incorrect, you'll lose a life. But don't worry, hints are here to save the day! If you're close to getting a group right, you might receive a message telling you that you're only one word away. But it's up to you to figure out which word to swap.

Remember, you only have four chances to make mistakes. So, let's strategize and avoid a game over situation. If you're really struggling, don't sweat it! I'll provide some hints and, if needed, the answers to today's Connections.

Now, let's move on to today's game. Here are the 16 words you'll be working with:

1. PACE
2. CLIPPER
3. MOVE
4. MEDICINE
5. FASTER
6. PROMPTER
7. ROCKET
8. SPEED
9. GO
10. SPUR
11. COMMUTE
12. HURRY
13. RATE
14. VISION
15. CLIP
16. PACER

Now, let's reveal the hints for each group:

Yellow group: something's swiftness
Green group: speed up!
Blue group: NBA team player
Purple group: linked by a term meaning ""over a long distance""

Take your time to analyze the hints and the words. Scroll down slowly if you need to. But be careful, spoilers are ahead!

And the groups are...

Yellow group: how fast something is going
Green group: ""step on it!""
Blue group: NBA team player
Purple group: tele____

Congratulations if you managed to figure them out! Now, let's unveil the answers:

Yellow group: how fast something is going (CLIP, PACE, RATE, SPEED)
Green group: ""step on it!"" (FASTER, GO, HURRY, MOVE)
Blue group: NBA team player (CLIPPER, PACER, ROCKET, SPUR)
Purple group: tele____ (COMMUTE, MEDICINE, PROMPTER, VISION)

Great job if you got them right! Even if you didn't, don't worry. It's all about having fun and challenging yourself. Today's game might not have been perfect, but my streak is now up to five games in a row!

I found the blues right away, though I suspected they might be a red herring. The greens and yellows were quite interesting as they seemed to represent different versions of the same concept, one as a noun and the other as a verb.

I made a small mistake initially by including COMMUTE with the greens instead of FASTER. But after correcting that, I was left with the purples, for which I managed to figure out the connection. Victory!

That wraps up today's Connections clues and answers. If you need hints or the solution for Tuesday's game, be sure to check out my blog. And before I go, here's a quick life tip for you: make it a point to dine in the best restaurant in your area at least once. Save up a little each month if you have to.

It's Monday, and we're back to the work week. Can you believe it's already the last week of March? Time flies when you're having fun with puzzle games!

I hope you all had a great weekend, despite the unexpected weather. It seems like spring was just around the corner, and then a snowstorm hit. It's cold and wintry, but you have to admit, the snow does make everything look quite pretty.

But enough about the weather, let's get back to Wordling! I know you're all eager for hints and clues, so here we go:

Hint: Normally, we think of this as a proper noun.
Clue: Today's Wordle has a double letter.

And now, the moment you've all been waiting for...the answer!

Today's Wordle phrase is a mystery waiting to be solved. So, without further ado, let's jump right into it!

Wordle Analysis
Every day, I eagerly check Wordle Bot to see how well I did. If you haven't tried it yet, you can check your Wordles with Wordle Bot too!

I have to admit, today's Wordle had me stumped. It started off on the wrong foot, leaving me with a whopping 195 possible solutions after the first round. Ouch! But I didn't give up.

With a little bit of luck, my guess of ""boink"" managed to cut down the options to just 40. Progress! But I was still floundering, unsure of the final answer.

Then, a breakthrough! ""Allay"" turned out to be a great guess. It revealed that there was more than one 'L' in the phrase, leaving me with only one word left to figure out. I was so close, I could taste it.

After some brainstorming, I finally settled on ""sally."" It may sound like a name, but it's also a term for a battle tactic. Who knew? Well, now we do!

Competitive Wordle Score
Unfortunately, today's score is a wash. No points for guessing in four or tying the Bot. It's a big, fat zero. But hey, there's always tomorrow!

Today's Wordle Etymology
Let's take a moment to appreciate the fascinating etymology of ""sally"" in this context. When we think of ""sally,"" we envision a sudden rush or attack from a defensive position, or embarking on a new journey or venture.

The word ""sally"" can be traced back through several languages before it found its way into English. Its journey begins with the Middle French word ""sallie,"" which is derived from ""sallir,"" meaning ""to rush out, leap forth."" And where did ""sallir"" come from? Latin, of course!

In Latin, ""salire"" means ""to leap,"" and this root has given rise to various related words in English. For example, ""salient"" refers to something prominently projecting, while ""assail"" means to attack. All these words reflect the idea of movement or leaping forth.

So, the etymology of ""sally"" beautifully captures the essence of suddenness, unexpectedness, and taking action. Whether it's a physical attack from a fortified position or embarking on a new journey, ""sally"" embodies the spirit of moving forward with determination.
