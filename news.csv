https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-household-robots-common.html,Engineering household robots to have a little common sense,"Robots are becoming increasingly adept at performing complex household tasks, from cleaning up spills to serving food. Many of these robots learn through imitation, where they replicate the motions guided by a human. However, if a robot encounters unexpected disruptions or errors, it may struggle to adapt and continue the task without starting from scratch. To address this challenge, engineers at MIT have developed a method that combines robot motion data with the ""common sense knowledge"" of large language models (LLMs).

The researchers have devised an approach that allows robots to logically break down household tasks into subtasks and adjust to disruptions within a subtask. This enables the robot to correct execution errors and improve overall task success without explicit programming for every possible failure. The team will present their findings at the International Conference on Learning Representations in May.

In their study, the researchers use the example of scooping marbles from one bowl and pouring them into another to illustrate their approach. Traditionally, engineers would guide the robot through the motions of scooping and pouring, providing multiple demonstrations for the robot to mimic. However, the team realized that a human demonstration consists of a single continuous trajectory, whereas the task is composed of a sequence of subtasks. For instance, the robot must reach into a bowl before scooping, scoop up marbles before moving to the empty bowl, and so on.

If the robot makes a mistake during any of these subtasks, it typically has to start from the beginning. To overcome this limitation, the researchers leverage the capabilities of LLMs. These deep learning models process large volumes of text to establish connections between words, sentences, and paragraphs. By prompting an LLM, it can generate a logical list of subtasks involved in a given task. For example, when queried about the actions required for scooping marbles, an LLM might produce a sequence of verbs such as ""reach,"" ""scoop,"" ""transport,"" and ""pour.""

The researchers found that LLMs could automatically provide instructions for each step of a task, expressed in natural language. They aimed to connect these instructions with a robot's understanding of its current stage in the task. To achieve this, the team developed an algorithm that maps an LLM's natural language label for a subtask to the robot's physical position or an image that encodes the robot's state. This process, known as ""grounding,"" allows the robot to know its position in the task and autonomously replan and recover from disruptions.

The MIT engineers' method introduces a new way for robots to adapt and self-correct during tasks without relying on explicit programming for every failure scenario. By leveraging the knowledge stored in LLMs, robots can better handle unexpected disruptions and improve overall task success. This approach has significant implications for advancing the capabilities of household robots and making them more efficient and reliable.

In conclusion, MIT engineers have developed a method that combines robot motion data with the knowledge stored in large language models to enable robots to adapt and self-correct during household tasks. This approach allows robots to logically break down tasks into subtasks and adjust to disruptions, improving their overall performance. By connecting an LLM's instructions with the robot's understanding of its task, engineers can avoid the need for explicit programming for every possible failure scenario. This research has the potential to enhance the capabilities of household robots and make them more effective in performing complex tasks.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/engineering-household.jpg,2024-03-25 09:48:20,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-large-language-simple-mechanism-knowledge.html,Large language models use a surprisingly simple mechanism to retrieve some stored knowledge,"Large language models (LLMs) are complex tools that are widely used in various fields, but researchers are still trying to fully understand how they work. To gain insights into these models, researchers from MIT and other institutions conducted a study on how LLMs retrieve and decode stored knowledge.

Surprisingly, the researchers discovered that LLMs often use a simple linear function to recover and decode facts. Linear functions, which involve two variables and no exponents, represent a straightforward relationship between the variables. The researchers found that LLMs use the same decoding function for similar types of facts.

By identifying these linear functions for different facts, the researchers were able to probe the model and determine where the knowledge is stored. They also developed a technique to estimate these functions. The researchers found that even when a model provides an incorrect answer, it often retains the correct information. This approach could be used in the future to identify and correct falsehoods within the model, reducing the occurrence of incorrect or nonsensical answers.

While LLMs are complex and nonlinear, this study reveals that simple mechanisms exist within them. The findings demonstrate that linear functions play a significant role in the retrieval and decoding of stored facts in LLMs.

The research team, including Evan Hernandez and Arnab Sharma, graduate students, and their advisors Jacob Andreas and David Bau, conducted experiments to investigate LLMs. They found that despite their complexity, LLMs use linear functions to decode relational information. Each type of fact has a specific decoding function associated with it.

For example, if a transformer model is prompted with ""Miles Davis plays the..."" it should respond with ""trumpet"" rather than ""Illinois."" The model uses a mechanism, represented by a linear function, to retrieve the relevant fact about Miles Davis playing the trumpet.

To estimate these linear functions, the researchers computed functions for 47 different relations, such as ""capital city of a country"" and ""lead singer of a band."" These relations were selected as representative examples of the types of facts found in LLMs.

The researchers conducted tests to verify the accuracy of each function by changing the subject and checking if the correct object information was recovered. This method allowed them to understand how LLMs store and retrieve information using linear functions.

The findings of this study shed light on the inner workings of LLMs and offer insights into their knowledge retrieval and decoding mechanisms. The research has the potential to contribute to the development of techniques to identify and correct inaccuracies within LLMs.

In conclusion, while LLMs are complex models, they often rely on simple linear functions to retrieve and decode stored knowledge. This study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms behind LLMs and opens up possibilities for improving their accuracy and reliability. Further research in this area could lead to advancements in the field of language models and artificial intelligence.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/large-language-models-2.jpg,2024-03-25 09:34:06,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-strategy-suppress-strain-propagation-ultrahigh.html,A strategy to suppress strain propagation in ultrahigh-Ni cathodes during fast charging,"To support the growing demand for the electronics industry and the adoption of electric vehicles, researchers are working on developing advanced battery technologies. One promising approach is the use of nickel-rich layered oxides as cathode materials in lithium-ion batteries (LiBs). These cathodes offer several advantages, such as increased battery capacity, improved rate capabilities, and reduced fabrication costs. However, they also face limitations, including capacity degradation and structural instability during fast-charging and long-term cycling.

To address these limitations, a team of researchers from Argonne National Laboratory and other institutes worldwide has proposed a novel strategy. Their findings were published in a paper in Nature Energy. The strategy involves using epitaxial entropy-assisted oxide coating to suppress strain propagation, which is the main cause of structural deterioration in cathodes during battery fast-charging and prolonged cycling.

In their study, the researchers designed a specialized oxide coating that aligns with the structure of nickel-rich cathodes. This coating not only improves the surface robustness of the cathode materials but also enhances ionic conductivity, enabling faster charging of batteries. The coating is based on Wadsley-Roth crystallographic shear phases, which have been found to enhance electrode performance in LiBs. These compounds adhere well to nickel-rich cathodes, thereby strengthening their structural stability during prolonged operation and fast-charging.

The team conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of their coating strategy. They coated nickel-rich layered cathodes and tested their performance over time and under various conditions. The results were highly promising, as the coating significantly reduced damage to the cathodes, even during fast-charging and after numerous operation cycles.

The researchers believe that their epitaxial entropy-assisted coating strategy has the potential to revolutionize surface engineering in the design and development of high-energy and high-power LiBs. By addressing the electro-chemomechanical instability without sacrificing energy and power density, this strategy could pave the way for more efficient and reliable battery technologies.

In conclusion, the use of nickel-rich layered oxides as cathode materials in LiBs shows great promise for enhancing battery performance. The researchers' novel strategy of epitaxial entropy-assisted oxide coating offers an innovative solution to the limitations faced by these cathodes. By suppressing strain propagation and improving structural stability, this coating strategy could lead to the development of more advanced and efficient battery technologies for various applications, including electric vehicles.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/a-strategy-to-suppress.jpg,2024-03-25 09:40:01,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/25/in-photos-worm-moon-lunar-eclipse-sets-up-total-solar-eclipse/,In Photos: â€˜Worm Moon Lunar Eclipseâ€™ Sets Up Total Solar Eclipse,"Marchâ€™s full moon, known as the ""Worm Moon,"" was visible on Sunday night and was partially eclipsed for nearly five hours into Monday in certain parts of the world. This event sets the stage for a total solar eclipse in North America on Monday, April 8.

The third full moon of 2024 and the first of spring in the northern hemisphere could be seen across the globe. However, the partial lunar eclipse was only visible from the night side of the planet at the appropriate time, which included North and South America, Europe, East Asia, Australia, and New Zealand.

During this time, the Earth partially obscured the sun from the moon's perspective. This created a stunning visual as the full Worm Moon rose above the skyline of midtown Manhattan and the Empire State Building in New York City. 

Throughout the world, there were many awe-inspiring images captured of the full moon and the partial lunar eclipse. These images showcase the beauty and grandeur of this celestial event.

A lunar eclipse occurs exclusively during a full moon. It happens when the moon enters the Earth's shadow, which can only occur when the moon is on the opposite side of the Earth from the sun.

On Monday morning, there was a penumbral lunar eclipse, where the moon entered the Earth's penumbra - the outer, less dense shadow. This eclipse lasted precisely 4 hours and 39 minutes. 

As the moon passed through the penumbra, Earth's shadow gradually moved across its surface, causing the light from the sun to dim. This is different from a ""Blood Moon,"" where the moon moves through the umbra and takes on a reddish hue due to sunlight being refracted by Earth's atmosphere.

During this penumbral lunar eclipse, the moon appeared against the backdrop of the constellation Virgo, with its brightest star, Spica, to its lower left, and Antares, the brightest star in the constellation Scorpius, to its upper right. Over the following two nights, the moon will appear even closer to Spica.

The Worm Moon, like all full moons, was visible throughout the night, rising in the east at sunset and setting in the west at sunrise. It earned its name because spring is when beetle larvae emerge from the thawing bark of trees.

Looking ahead, the next new moon on Monday, April 8, will be a ""supermoon"" and will appear larger than usual. This new moon will move across the sun, causing a partial solar eclipse visible in North America. The total solar eclipse on April 8 will last up to 4 minutes and 26 seconds but can only be seen within a 115-mile wide path of totality.

This path will span from the Pacific coast of northwestern Mexico to Atlantic Canada, passing through parts of 15 U.S. states: Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. Those outside this path will only witness a partial solar eclipse.

It is relatively rare for a total solar eclipse to occur, happening on average once every 366 years. However, North America has the fortune of experiencing two total solar eclipses within a span of just seven years, with the previous one taking place on August 21, 2017.

Following the Worm Moon and the total solar eclipse, the next full moon will be the ""Pink Moon"" on Tuesday, April 23, at 23:48 UTC. This will be the fourth full moon of 2024.

As we admire these celestial events, we wish you clear skies and the ability to witness the wonders of the universe.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6601aa9bc397763ceaf0c79a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1566,881,x217,y217,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 12:57:41,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.forbes.com/sites/webroot/2024/03/25/7-cyber-safety-tips-to-outsmart-scammers/,7 Cyber Safety Tips To Outsmart Scammers,"Welcome to the wild west of the digital world, where cyber scammers are lurking around every pixelated corner. Cybercrime is not just a futuristic Hollywood plotline; it is a real threat that targets everyone, from wide-eyed kids to seasoned adults and wise grandparents. And guess what? It is on the rise faster than your Wi-Fi connection during peak hours. So, hoist the sails as we cruise through the seven seas of cyber safety.

Before we dive headfirst into the world of cyber safety tips, let us equip ourselves with the ultimate weapon: knowledge. Scams are the digital equivalent of a snake oil salesperson peddling miracle cures. They come in all shapes and sizes, lurking in the shadowy corners of the internet. Let us embrace the golden rule of scam detection: skepticism.

Whether it is a promise of untold riches, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, or a free Caribbean cruise courtesy of a Nigerian prince, approach with caution and a healthy dose of skepticism. Now, let us take a quick tour through the terrain of common cyber scams.

Phishing scams, ah, the bane of our digital existence. These sneaky scams involve fake emails posing as messages from familiar faces or reputable companies. They will try to sweet-talk you into clicking on suspicious links or divulging sensitive information like passwords or credit card details. Remember: real companies do not ask for your personal data via email.

Sweepstakes and awards scams, congratulations! You have just won a brand new car, a tropical vacation, and a lifetime supply of unicorn-shaped cookies. All you need to do is pay a small processing fee. Sound too good to be true? That is because it is! These scams offer you instant wealth but are really just clever ruses to empty your wallet faster than you can say ""jackpot.""

Investment scams, picture this: a golden opportunity to double your money with zero risk. Investment scams lure unsuspecting victims with the promise of sky-high profits. Do not let these offers cloud your judgment. Always do your due diligence before investing your hard-earned cash.

Lawsuit or tax scams thrive on instilling fear and panic, claiming you owe urgent payments. When in doubt, verify the legitimacy of any claims before reaching for your wallet.

Romance scams prey on the trusting hearts of hopeful romantics, weaving elaborate tales of love and devotion before swooping in for the financial kill. Remember: anyone who asks for money online is more likely to break your heart than mend it.

Tech support scams, these imposters offer remote assistance to fix nonexistent problems with your laptop or devices while gaining access to your sensitive data. Remember: legitimate tech support does not come knocking unsolicited. If in doubt, just delete the email and seek help from trusted sources.

Armed with this knowledge, you are ready to navigate the digital minefield with confidence. You can also be a good internet citizen by forwarding these scams to the U.S. government's Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) at phishing-report@us-cert.gov.

Now, let us move on to the seven tips that will help you stay safe online.

Use strong passwords: Let us kick things off with the basics. Your password is the digital key to your castle, so make sure it is not something as flimsy as ""123456"" or ""password."" Get creative! Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters like a mad scientist concocting a secret potion. And do not reuse passwords across multiple accounts unless you want to throw a welcome party for cybercriminals.

Keep your software up to date: Software updates are not just annoying pop-ups; they are essential for your online safety. These updates often include security patches that fix vulnerabilities and protect you from the latest threats. So, do not ignore those update notifications. Embrace them like a digital shield.

Beware of suspicious links: Just like you would not open a mysterious package from an unknown sender, do not click on suspicious links. They can lead you down a rabbit hole of malware, spyware, and other nasty digital creatures. Instead, hover your mouse over the link to see the actual URL before clicking. And if something seems off, trust your gut and steer clear.

Use a reliable antivirus program: Think of an antivirus program as your trusty sidekick in the battle against cyber threats. It will scan your computer for malware, block malicious websites, and keep your digital life safe and sound. So, invest in a reliable antivirus program and let it do its magic.

Be cautious on social media: Social media can be a breeding ground for cyber scams. Be mindful of what you share and who you connect with. Avoid accepting friend requests from strangers or clicking on suspicious links. And remember, not everything you see on social media is true. So, double-check before believing and sharing.

Secure your Wi-Fi network: Your Wi-Fi network is the gateway to your digital world. So, make sure it is locked, loaded, and secured with a strong password. Change the default network name and password to something unique. And if you have guests, create a separate guest network to keep your main network shielded.

Educate yourself and others: Knowledge is power, especially in the world of cyber safety. Stay informed about the latest scams and share your knowledge with friends, family, and coworkers. Together, we can create a safer digital environment for everyone.

In conclusion, the wild west of the digital world may be filled with cyber scammers, but with the right knowledge and precautions, you can navigate through it safely. Embrace skepticism, stay alert, and follow these seven tips to stay one step ahead of the cybercriminals. Remember, your online safety is in your hands. So, hoist the sails, set sail on the sea of cyber safety, and enjoy the journey with peace of mind.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ea0ea426a7cb96ff0f5cde/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 11:48:40,Innovation,Innovation

Today, we have a lot to cover, so let's jump right in.

First off, let's talk about the current state of the stock market. Stocks around the world are experiencing a decline, but on the bright side, crypto seems to be performing well with recent gains. It's always interesting to see how these two markets interact and influence each other.

Now, let's turn our attention to the world of startups. One of the biggest news stories making waves is the departure of Stability AI's CEO. This is significant because the company's revenue growth and burn rate have been hot topics of discussion. It will be interesting to see how this leadership change will impact the company's trajectory.

Shifting gears to the EU, there are several U.S.-based tech companies facing inquiries due to the new Digital Markets Act. This raises the question of whether tech giants can establish a better working relationship with the EU. It's a complex issue with potentially far-reaching implications.

Speaking of Europe, Spotify, known for its music streaming service, is making another non-musical move. I have some thoughts on this strategic shift and what it means for the company's future. It's always fascinating to see how companies evolve and expand their offerings.

In other news, China is making strides in the tech industry. The country is set to launch the Vision Pro, its latest technological innovation. Additionally, there is a push to remove Intel and AMD chips from state computers. This shows China's ambition to become a major player in the global tech landscape.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelicamarideoliveira/2024/03/25/felipe-meneses-is-the-first-brazilian-thiel-fellow/,Felipe Meneses Is The First Brazilian Thiel Fellow,"Felipe Meneses, a young Brazilian tech entrepreneur, has made history by becoming the first Latin Thiel Fellow. The Thiel Fellowship, initiated by billionaire Peter Thiel in 2011, awards $100,000 to individuals who choose to forgo college and instead start their own companies. Meneses, a 23-year-old from Sergipe, dropped out of Stanford University and has been selected to participate in the two-year acceleration program starting in 2024. This is an incredible opportunity for Meneses, who recognizes its significance.

In 2022, Meneses, along with Felipe Lamounier, Daniel Silva, and Rohan Ramanath, co-founded Hyperplane. This data intelligence firm utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to help banks enhance their customer experience through hyper-personalization techniques. While based in Silicon Valley, Hyperplane initially launched in Brazil and has secured contracts with 12 of the country's major financial institutions. The company has already received investments totaling 30 million reais ($6 million) from various backers, including Lachy Groom, SV Angel, Clocktower Technology Ventures, Liquid2 Ventures, Soma Capital, Latitud, Atman Capital, Crestone VC, and Norte. Additionally, Hyperplane has been chosen to participate in Endeavor's Scale-UP acceleration program in the first half of 2024.

Meneses's achievement is particularly remarkable considering that he is the only Latin American founder selected for the Thiel Fellowship this year. In fact, no entrepreneurs from the region were included in the 2023 cohort either. However, Latin representation was present in the 2022 list of Thiel Fellows. Among the entrepreneurs in that year's initiative were Ian Lee, the founder of Examedi, a healthtech company based in Chile. Examedi facilitates access to healthcare by connecting patients with available healthcare providers. Another Latin founder from the 2022 cohort is Tamara Chaya Romo, a Mexican entrepreneur leading MEDU. This company is dedicated to developing reusable personal protective equipment.

The inclusion of Latin entrepreneurs in prestigious programs like the Thiel Fellowship is a testament to the growing innovation and talent coming from the region. It showcases the potential for Latin American startups to make a significant impact on a global scale. Meneses's success is not only a personal triumph but also a celebration of the entrepreneurial spirit that thrives in Latin America.

The Thiel Fellowship serves as a catalyst for young innovators to pursue their entrepreneurial dreams without the traditional path of higher education. It recognizes that college may not be the ideal route for everyone and offers an alternative avenue for those with groundbreaking ideas and ambitions. By providing financial support and mentorship, the fellowship empowers these individuals to bring their visions to life and create meaningful change in their respective industries.

Meneses's journey, from dropping out of Stanford to becoming a Thiel Fellow, exemplifies the possibilities that exist when individuals are given the freedom to chart their own course. His selection for this prestigious program is a testament to his exceptional abilities and the potential of Hyperplane to revolutionize the field of data intelligence. As Meneses continues to make strides in his entrepreneurial career, he paves the way for future Latin American innovators to follow in his footsteps.

The Latin American startup ecosystem is gaining recognition and attracting attention from investors worldwide. With initiatives like the Thiel Fellowship highlighting the region's talent, we can expect to see continued growth and success in the coming years. Meneses's participation in the Thiel Fellowship is a significant milestone, not only for him but also for the entire Latin American entrepreneurial community. It serves as a reminder that with determination, creativity, and the right support, individuals can achieve greatness regardless of their background or educational path.

As we celebrate Felipe Meneses's accomplishment, let us recognize the immense potential within the Latin American startup ecosystem. The future is bright, and with more opportunities like the Thiel Fellowship, we can expect to witness even more groundbreaking innovations from this vibrant and talented community.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66019447ce2364c0c92ae041/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 11:13:47,Innovation,Innovation
