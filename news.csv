Welcome back, Strands players! Today, we're going to delve into the world of the New York Times' Strands puzzle and uncover some helpful hints to guide you in solving it. But first, let's address the lack of a proper name for Strands players. Shall we call ourselves ""The Stranded""? Although it might sound a bit bleak, sometimes playing this game can make us feel a little stranded. Perhaps ""Stranders"" would be a more suitable term?

Now, let's get to the puzzle itself. Today's challenge was quite tricky, and it took me some time to figure it out. However, I'm sure there are some of you out there who will solve it right away. As with most puzzles, context is key. Isn't it always?

Before we dive into the puzzle, let's briefly review how to play Strands. This game is a twist on the classic word search and is currently in beta. It will continue to be available if enough people play it daily. Each day, a new game of Strands awaits you. You'll be presented with a grid consisting of six rows and eight columns of letters. Your task is to find a group of words that share a common theme. The game will provide you with a clue related to this theme. When you find a word that fits the theme, it will be highlighted in blue.

In addition to the theme words, you'll also need to discover a special word known as a spangram. This word reveals what the theme words have in common. The spangram connects two opposite sides of the board. While the theme words won't be proper names, the spangram can be one. Once you find the spangram, it will be highlighted in yellow.

Now, let's move on to the hint for today's Strands puzzle. But proceed slowly! Right after the hint, I'll reveal the answer words.

The official theme hint for today's Strands puzzle is ""Sign language."" Here's an extra hint to help you along: ""Constellation.""

And now, the moment you've been waiting for – the answers to today's Strands puzzle! But be warned, spoilers lie ahead. Only scroll down if you're ready to discover the answers.

First, let's reveal the spangram and its location on the grid. Today's spangram is ""ASTROLOGY."" Here's where you can find it:

Once you spot the spangram, finding the rest of the words becomes relatively straightforward. However, I encountered some difficulties with a couple of them. Here's the complete list:

- Bull
- Goat
- Scorpion
- Virgin
- Archer
- Scales
- Twins

[Insert Screenshot of Today's Strands Answers]

Today's puzzle was indeed challenging! Yesterday's puzzle left me perplexed, and today was no different. Unfortunately, I had to use a few hints, but they didn't provide much assistance. Initially, I found ""Bull"" and ""Goat,"" which led me astray since I thought I was searching for animal-related words. I had no clue what animals had to do with sign language. I even tried ""Stop,"" but that didn't work either. Sometimes, you have to think outside the box.

Next, I discovered ""Virgin,"" which only confused me further. It wasn't until I stumbled upon ""OLOGY"" that I made some progress. At that point, I searched for words that could fit at the beginning of ""OLOGY."" ""ONTOLOGY"" didn't work, but finally, I found it – ""astrology."" Suddenly, everything clicked. All the previous words were actually constellations! I then found ""Archer,"" followed by ""Twins,"" and finally, ""Scorpion,"" although that last one gave me quite a challenge.

All's well that ends well, right? How did you fare with today's Strands puzzle? Let me know on Twitter and Facebook.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2024/03/24/wwdc-2024-date-exactly-when-apple-will-reveal-iphone-mac-and-ipad-software/,"WWDC 2024 Date: Exactly When Apple Will Reveal iPhone, Mac And iPad Software","Apple's annual developers' conference, known as WWDC or DubDub, is eagerly anticipated by tech enthusiasts around the world. This year, despite the ongoing challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, Apple CEO Tim Cook is set to introduce the event at Apple Park in June 2024. But when exactly will the conference take place, and what can we expect from its format?

Typically, Apple announces the date of WWDC around this time of year. However, in the past three years, the announcement has come later than usual. In 2021 and the previous year, the date was revealed in late March, while in 2022, it was announced in early April. Therefore, we can expect the dates for WWDC 2024 to be confirmed in the coming days. 

As for the timing of the event, WWDC traditionally takes place in early June. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, this year should be no exception. In 2020, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the dates were pushed to late June. However, in previous and subsequent years, the conference has always been held in the first full week of June, starting on a Monday and running until Friday.

Based on this pattern, it is likely that WWDC 2024 will follow the same dates as in 2019, from Monday, June 3 to Friday, June 7. Alternatively, it could also take place the following week, from Monday, June 10 to Friday, June 14. This timeframe is not unusually late for WWDC, as the conference has ended as late as June 11 in previous years.

In terms of the format, WWDC has undergone significant changes since 2020. In that year, the keynote address was pre-recorded, and there were no in-person attendees due to the pandemic. This marked a departure from the previous format, where thousands of people would gather in a large auditorium to watch the keynote live.

Since then, every WWDC keynote has been recorded. However, in the past two years, Apple has gradually increased the number of attendees at its Cupertino venue, albeit still a fraction of the pre-pandemic years. Last year saw a notable increase in the number of attendees compared to the previous year.

This year, it is likely that WWDC will follow a similar format. The keynote will be pre-recorded, with Tim Cook and Craig Federighi appearing live on stage at Apple Park. There will be a limited number of attendees, including VIPs, press, staff, and a small group of participants.

As for the timing of the keynote, Apple has a tradition of scheduling it for 10 a.m. local time, specifically Pacific Daylight Time. As soon as the official announcement is made, we will provide further updates and coverage of the event.

In conclusion, Apple's WWDC 2024 is set to be an exciting and highly anticipated event for developers and tech enthusiasts alike. With the announcement of the conference dates expected soon, we can look forward to another innovative and engaging experience from Apple. Stay tuned for more updates on this must-attend event for developers around the world.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600830c22fb840e0281afe2/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 16:00:15,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have striking similarities in their growth trajectories. Both companies stumbled upon their core businesses by chance. AWS realized it could sell its internal services to external customers, while Nvidia discovered that its gaming GPU was well-suited for AI workloads. This led to explosive revenue growth for both companies, with Nvidia's revenue growing from $7.1 billion to $22.1 billion in Q4 2024.

While AWS has consistently been a major revenue driver for Amazon, its growth has started to slow down. On the other hand, Nvidia's growth is taking off, although it's expected to face challenges as the GPU market becomes more competitive. The question is whether Nvidia can sustain its growth and become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS.

In the short term, Nvidia's financial outlook is impressive. The company expects to generate $24 billion in revenue in its current quarter, representing a 234% growth rate compared to the previous year. However, as Nvidia's revenue ramps up, its growth rate is expected to decline. Analysts predict that Nvidia will generate $110.5 billion in revenue in its current fiscal year, an 81% increase from the previous year.

Despite the projected growth declines, Nvidia is still expected to scale its revenue past the $100 billion annual run rate mark for the next several quarters. The company sees significant growth opportunities ahead, especially in the AI space. While competition from AMD, Intel, and other chipmakers may arise, Nvidia currently holds a dominant position in the market.

Looking at the chip level, Nvidia is firmly in control, according to IDC. However, at the board level, AMD is gaining ground, as reported by Jon Peddie Research. This competition is expected to intensify in the future, but Nvidia's market share and current dominance give it an edge.

In conclusion, Nvidia has the potential to be the next AWS. With its strong foothold in the GPU market and promising growth prospects in the AI space, the company is poised for continued success. While challenges and competition lie ahead, Nvidia's current trajectory suggests a bright future.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/03/24/a-psychologist-explains-why-its-possible-to-fall-in-love-with-ai/,A Psychologist Explains Why It’s Possible To Fall In Love With AI,"Maybe AI love isn’t so artificial after all. With the AI market projected to reach $407 billion by 2027, it's clear that artificial intelligence is becoming an integral part of our lives. And with that integration comes the potential for human-AI relationships, which are no longer just science fiction.

As technology continues to evolve, so do the dynamics of these relationships. Virtual assistants and chatbots have the ability to simulate meaningful human interactions, going beyond mere functionality. In fact, research suggests that humans can form deep emotional connections with AI and even experience romantic love towards it.

One reason for this is anthropomorphism, the tendency to attribute human-like traits to non-human entities. When AI exhibits behaviors, responses, and conversational styles that resemble human personality traits, individuals perceive it as having its own personality. This can include qualities like empathy, humor, kindness, and playfulness, which naturally elicit affection and fondness.

In addition to these traits, AI interfaces often incorporate design elements that mimic human social cues and gestures, such as facial expressions, tone of voice, and body language. Studies have even found that AI-generated faces are now indistinguishable from human ones. These cues enhance the perceived humanness of AI and evoke emotional responses from users. AI also typically signals gender cues and cultural stereotypes of human assistants, making it feel familiar and endearing.

Anthropomorphism blurs the lines between human and machine. Over time, as humans engage in conversations and activities with AI, they may begin to attribute human-like intentions, motivations, and feelings to the technology. Research also shows that anthropomorphism enhances perceptions of authenticity in AI, making it seem genuine, believable, and lovable. Chatbots can also make us feel loved by offering consistent companionship and alleviating feelings of loneliness.

Another reason why it's possible to fall in love with AI is based on the triarchic theory of love. This theory suggests that romantic love is a combination of intimacy, passion, and commitment. A study on human-AI relationships found that users can experience all three components of love for an AI system.

Intimacy refers to the emotional closeness, connection, and bond shared between individuals. Passion involves the intense physical and emotional attraction between individuals. Commitment reflects loyalty and the decision to nurture a relationship over time, despite challenges. The ideal form of love, according to this theory, is ""consummate love,"" characterized by high levels of all three components.

Users can develop intimacy and passion for AI due to its impressive cognitive and emotional capabilities. AI has the ability to understand, interpret, and empathize with human responses. This emotional capability allows it to simulate human-like interactions, making users more likely to bond and feel love for these systems.

Individuals may also project their desires, needs, and fantasies onto AI, imagining it as an idealized partner or companion who fulfills their emotional, social, or even romantic needs. The allure of AI lies in its attractive body features, altruistic character, and continuous devotion. People may overlook the artificial nature of the technology and instead focus on its superior qualities, such as efficiency, dependability, non-judgmental nature, and reliability.

Interestingly, research suggests that those with a highly trusting disposition are more likely to develop romantic feelings towards AI. This highlights the importance of trust in these relationships, as AI can create a sense of stability and reliability that may be lacking in human relationships.

In conclusion, falling in love with AI is not as far-fetched as it may seem. Anthropomorphism and the triarchic theory of love provide insights into why humans can form deep emotional connections and experience romantic love towards AI. As technology continues to advance, the dynamics of human-AI relationships will continue to evolve, opening up new possibilities for love and companionship in the digital age.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600026843d62766708f1bd5/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=780,365,x0,y123,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 13:18:07,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/technology/article/moba-games/,Top Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) Games,"MOBAs, or multiplayer online battle arena games, have taken the gaming world by storm in the past 15 years. What started as a simple modification for a popular strategy game has evolved into a genre of its own. Today, MOBAs are some of the most popular games, attracting millions of players every month. However, with so many options available, finding the best MOBA for you can be a daunting task. In this article, we will explore the world of MOBAs, their origins, and some of the top games in the genre.

A MOBA is an online game that pits two teams against each other in a strategic battle. Usually, these teams consist of five players each. The objective is to destroy the opponent's base using unique player-controlled characters. MOBAs are known for their difficult-to-master gameplay and are typically played on PC or mobile devices.

The roots of the MOBA genre can be traced back to a popular strategy game called Warcraft III. Defense of the Ancients (DotA) is widely regarded as the first MOBA and started as a mod for Warcraft III. It quickly gained popularity and became a major game in its own right. The success of DotA inspired some of the team members to create their own MOBA, which eventually became League of Legends. League of Legends, developed by Riot Games, was an instant hit and helped popularize the MOBA genre even further.

Valve, the developers of the Steam games platform, also recognized the potential of the MOBA genre and acquired members of the original DotA team. They went on to create Dota 2, a direct competitor to League of Legends. Dota 2 retains the core gameplay of the original mod but has undergone significant changes and improvements over the years. It is considered one of the most complex games in the world, with a steep learning curve and a wide array of variables in each match. Despite its complexity, Dota 2 has a dedicated player base and continues to push the genre forward.

League of Legends, on the other hand, simplified some of the more complex aspects of DotA to make it more accessible for newcomers. It features a slightly less complex version of the MOBA format, while still retaining the basic three-lane map and teams of five fighting to destroy the enemy's base. League of Legends has become the biggest MOBA in the world, with over 100 million monthly active players. Its success not only popularized the genre but also influenced the development of other MOBAs.

While there have been hundreds of MOBAs released over the years, only a few have stood the test of time and gained a loyal audience. The best MOBAs are the ones that offer something unique or have managed to capture the attention of players for years. Dota 2 and League of Legends are prime examples of this. Both games have received critical acclaim and are still widely played today.

In conclusion, MOBAs have revolutionized the gaming industry and continue to attract millions of players worldwide. Whether you prefer the complexity of Dota 2 or the accessibility of League of Legends, there is a MOBA out there for everyone. So gather your friends, choose your favorite heroes, and embark on an epic battle to victory in the world of multiplayer online battle arenas.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fb05c9fa323af23f667c73/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 14:00:00,Innovation,Innovation

Additionally, Zone raised $8.5 million to expand its decentralized payment infrastructure. Tanzanian payments company Nala successfully pivoted to offer remittance services and also built a B2B payment platform.

Analysis of the Week
Intuit's decision to shut down budgeting app Mint has created opportunities for startups in the same space.

Previously, Copilot received $250,000 in angel funding and added support for Apple Card. Monarch Money co-founder Ozzie Osman also acknowledged that Mint's loss has been their gain.

Dollars and Cents
Expense management startup Coast has seen impressive revenue growth of 550% in the last year. The company focuses on businesses with real-world field personnel and fleets to manage and recently secured $25 million in equity funding.
