https://techxplore.com/news/2023-09-tape-lithium-ion-batteries-battery-degradation.html,Replacing tape used to make lithium-ion batteries could slow battery degradation and reduce self-discharge,"A team of chemists and physicists at Dalhousie University in Canada has recently discovered that replacing polyethylene terephthalate (PET) tape used in lithium-ion batteries with polypropylene (PP) tape could slow down battery degradation and reduce self-discharge of smartphones and other personal devices. The group studied and compared the behavior of PET and PP tape in lithium-ion batteries over time and discovered that the PP tape lasts approximately 10% longer than PET tape battery life and reduces self-discharge by approximately 70%. This development could help boost battery performance and lifespan, which is an issue that both device makers and owners want to improve. The researchers note that further testing is required to ensure the PP tape works equally well as PET tape before using it in new devices; however, it is expected that the switch from PET to PP tape won't affect the cost of devices. The report of their project is found in the journal Nature Materials.",https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/800a/2023/replacing-tape-used-to.jpg

This exosuit is a type of device that can be worn over the body and was created to improve running speed. Engineers and roboticists have been creating these exosuits for multiple applications over the past several years. Some are designed to assist those with disabilities to walk, others assist troops in carrying heavier loads, while others help people to jog a little faster or run longer distances.

The exosuit that was built by the team in South Korea is small with minimal parts. The device consists of a backpack, which contains a power pack that provides pressure on cables that extend from the pack to the hips and down each thigh. The suit is lightweight, weighing just 4.4 kilograms. The cables help to improve running speed by assisting with each stride. As a step is taken, the attached cable constricts, pulling the trailing leg forward faster than it would normally. The researchers also incorporated sensors and a computer that can process information regarding gait, allowing for automatic synchronization with steps when the person runs.

The team tested their exosuit by asking amateur volunteers to run on a treadmill. The exosuit resulted in a 4% improvement in running times. The promising results from this study could lead to further development of exosuits that can be used to improve physical performance in various applications in the future.

Overall, the team's work in developing an exosuit that can improve running speed is an exciting development in the field of wearable technology. With further development and testing, this technology could potentially be used by athletes to improve their performance and by anyone looking to improve their physical abilities.",https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/800a/2023/exosuit-helps-runners.jpg

To address these demands, the sector must explore alternative materials to produce devices that cater to the growing role of computing. While silicon remains the workhorse material of choice, the industry must make strategic advancements in chip materials and architectures to meet these challenges. Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors are an object of interest to researchers, as they are thin, requiring less energy to power while providing greater control over the flow of electricity in a device.

https://techxplore.com/news/2023-09-revolutionizing-storage-dna-movable-type-paves.html,Revolutionizing data storage: DNA movable-type system paves the way for sustainable data storage technology,"In a recent publication in Engineering, researchers have discovered an innovative method for data storage that involves using DNA fragments, referred to as ""DNA movable types."" The study, titled ""Engineering DNA Materials for Sustainable Data Storage Using a DNA Movable-Type System,"" highlights how this approach can be used for data writing, replacing the traditional costly and environmentally hazardous method of DNA synthesis. 

While DNA molecules are known for their high-density and sustainable data storage capacity, traditional DNA synthesis has been cost-prohibitive and ecologically harmful. To address this concern, the researchers looked to ancient movable-type printing and developed a DNA movable-type storage system. 

The new system's groundbreaking feature is the use of pre-generated DNA fragments called DNA movable types as the basic writing units. These movable types are put together in a repetitive manner to encode digital information, circumventing the need for de novo DNA synthesis. Rapid DNA movable-type assembly is then used to write data, providing a dependable and economical alternative to storage.

The researchers were able to encode 24 bytes of digital information in the DNA using this system and accurately read it back using high-throughput sequencing and decoding. The team's demonstration shows the feasibility and potential of the DNA movable-type storage system.

One of the key benefits of this system is the potential to reduce costs. Pre-synthesized DNA fragments eliminate the need for expensive DNA synthesis, while the process of writing data is entirely biological and environmentally friendly. Additionally, because the process is assembly-based, it can be easily parallelized to improve efficiency and scalability.

The DNA movable-type storage system opens the door to sustainable, economical, and environmentally friendly data storage. As high-throughput automation systems continue to evolve, researchers expect the data write bandwidth of this system to improve substantially, meeting the increasing demands of large data storage. 

This innovative system may be used in several areas, including archival data storage and cloud computing, and has the potential to revolutionize the way we store and access information. By utilizing the power of DNA, researchers are paving the way for a more sustainable, efficient digital data storage technology. The DNA movable-type storage system represents a significant step forward in the data storage field, with the potential for scalability, cost reduction, and sustainability.",https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/800a/2023/revolutionizing-data-s.jpg

https://techxplore.com/news/2023-09-sustainable-semiconductors-multielement-ink.html,Accelerating sustainable semiconductors with 'multielement ink',"Semiconductors are critical components of electronic devices, but their production requires a lot of energy. The traditional method of turning sand into semiconductors demanded a significant amount of heat-intensive energy at nearly 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit. However, researchers from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and UC Berkeley have developed a ""multielement ink"" semiconductor that could curb this energy demand and make the manufacturing process more sustainable. This breakthrough marks the first ""high-entropy"" semiconductor that can be processed at low-temperature or room temperature, according to a recent report in the journal Nature. The researchers utilized two families of semiconducting materials: hard alloys made of high-entropy semiconductors and a soft, flexible material made of crystalline halide perovskites. High-entropy materials are solids made of five or more chemical elements that assemble in near-equal proportions into a single system. The researchers synthesized high-entropy halide persovskite single crystals from a solution under room temperature or low-temperature conditions. The low-temperature/room-temperature technique produced single-crystal semiconductors far faster than conventional semiconductor fabrication techniques. The high-entropy ""multielement ink"" halide perovskite had an impressive ambient-air stability of at least six months, making it an ideal color-tunable LED or other solid-state lighting device. The material could potentially serve as a programmable component in an optical computing device that uses light to transfer or store data.

https://techxplore.com/news/2023-09-roof-material-cool-air-energy.html,Can a roof's material cool the outside air and lower energy demand?,"Concrete sidewalks, black asphalt streets, traffic, brick and steel buildings. These common city elements can retain heat and increase temperatures in a phenomenon called the urban heat island effect. With increasingly warming temperatures during the summer months, urban cities like Chicago need to arm decision makers and communities with information about strategies to help keep their residents cool. One strategy involves something all buildings already have: a roof. Certain roofing materials can help cool the surrounding outside air and decrease the need for air conditioning (AC).

To help understand how climate is affecting urban communities, researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory examined three different types of roofing strategies and their impact on near-surface temperature and cooling energy demand through regional modeling in the Chicago metropolitan area.

""We chose to run our model during a heat wave event—where temperatures cross the 95th percentile observed in a city for three consecutive days—as opposed to average summer temperatures so that we could maximize potential benefits,"" said Rao Kotamarthi, science director for Argonne's Center for Climate Resilience and Decision Science (CCRDS) and author of the study.

The team ran a regional climate model simulating the Chicago metro area and three types of roofs: cool (painted a heat-reflecting white), green (vegetation) and solar panels. They found that the three types of roofs reduced the near-surface temperature and AC consumption demand during daytime hours when air temperature is the highest. Cool roofs reduced the near-surface temperature by 1.5 degrees Celsius, followed by 1.2 degrees for green roofs and 0.6 degrees for solar panel roofs across the Chicago area.

Because all the roofing strategies offer cooling effects, they reduce AC consumption. Cool roofs reduced AC energy consumption the most, followed by green roofs and solar panel roofs. Energy demand was shown to be reduced by 16.6%, 14.0%, and 7.6%, when cool roofs, green roofs and solar panel roofs are deployed, respectively.

Overall, the large-scale deployment of cool roofs showed the best potential for cooling effects and cooling energy saving. They cost less than the other two technologies, and they do not require additional water. However, they are not helpful in managing stormwater loads as green roofs have the potential to do. Stakeholders can use results of the study to inform sustainable development approaches, lower summertime cooling energy demand, and help minimize greenhouse gas emissions in the long term over the Chicago region.

This work was conducted as part of the Community Research on Climate & Urban Science (CROCUS) Urban Integrated Field Laboratory. CROCUS is led by Argonne in partnership with academic and community organizations and civic and industry champions. Focused on the Chicago region, CROCUS studies urban climate change and its implications for environmental justice.

""The difference in cost between the roofs is approximately a factor of three,"" said Kotamarthi, who is also the CROCUS science director. ""Which option is the most cost effective to get the most benefit? If a community is deciding on a strategy, we can look at the model and give them an actual answer.""

And the results are a good starting point for what the researchers hope to achieve next, a city-scale and global-scale model for each of the roofing options. But how do you incorporate a green roof into a computer model? First, researchers will work to better understand green roofs by taking measurements at surface and building levels to improve on how a green roof is represented.

""We have very few measurements for green roofs,"" said Kotamarthi. ""We need to measure how much energy goes in, how much goes out, and how much water it needs and how fast it retains it. We need these measurements to give us a complete understanding of the process so we can refine calculations and models.""

Researchers will measure the roofs of CROCUS partners throughout the city. For instance, Northeastern Illinois University has both roof types, while other partner buildings have solar panels.

Finally, the researchers want to improve the resolution of the model all the way down to street scale. Kotamarthi explained that achieving this will help them see the difference between houses and streets, which is important because it will help answer questions such as, if a tree is planted, how much does it cool the nearby building and the pavement?

The tetrahedron shaped robot, called Tetraflex, has flexible piping which enables it to move through small gaps or over challenging terrain. It can also encase fragile objects, such as eggs, within its soft body and transport them safely. Published in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, the findings demonstrate that Tetraflex is capable of locomotion in multiple different ways, making it useful for mobility in a challenging or confined environment, such as exploring other planets, oil rig inspections or navigating rubble to reach survivors of an earthquake. The robot also has the ability to transport payloads from otherwise inaccessible locations, allowing for ecological surveying or nuclear decommissioning. The robot is composed of soft struts connected by rigid nodes, with each strut formed of an airtight rubber bellow. The length of each strut can be controlled by varying the air pressure within the bellow, with higher pressures causing the bellow to extend and lower pressures causing it to contract. Controlled simultaneously, the pressure in each bellow can control the shape and size change of the robot. The team now plan to apply machine learning algorithms to optimize movement patterns and discover new ways of moving around or interacting with the environment.",https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/800a/2023/transformer-new-multi.jpg
https://techxplore.com/news/2023-09-light-activated-acid-energy-efficient-on-demand-captured.html,"Light-activated acid drives energy-efficient, on-demand release of captured carbon dioxide","Researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory have discovered a new way of releasing carbon dioxide from solutions used in direct air capture (DAC). This research allows for economically viable separation of CO2 from the atmosphere by using light instead of heat to initiate a chemical reaction that leads to CO2's energy-efficient release. Current DAC technologies require heating solvents to release the CO2 and regenerate the amino acid sorbent for recycling, whereas this new approach has found a way to release CO2 at ambient conditions by using a photoacid catalyst. The development of this technology provides a proof of concept for using irradiation with ultraviolet light instead of heating a solution to release CO2, and this development could pave the way for widespread industrial deployment and widespread use.",https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/800a/2023/light-activated-acid-d.jpg
