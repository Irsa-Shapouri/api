As we approach the reveal of next month's PlayStation Plus lineup, there's still time to enjoy the current lineup, which offers a diverse selection of four games. One game in particular, Sifu, has been on my prediction list for a while, and I'm glad to see that my prediction was correct. Now, let's see if any of my other predictions for April come true.

For those who may be unfamiliar, PlayStation Plus (PS Plus) is Sony's monthly membership program that provides access to online gaming. It's important to note that PS Plus is not required for streaming movies or TV shows on platforms like Netflix, nor is it necessary for free-to-play games such as Warzone or Fortnite. However, any paid online games do require a subscription to PS Plus. There are three tiers of PS Plus: Essential, Extra, and Premium. In this post, we will focus on the Essential tier's free monthly games. Following a recent price increase, the cost of these tiers is as follows: PS Plus Essential - $79.99/year; PS Plus Extra - $134.99/year; PS Plus Premium - $159.99/year.

Now, let's talk about when Sony will reveal the lineup for next month's PS Plus games. Typically, Sony unveils the games on the last Wednesday of the month, but this isn't always the case. The general rule is that the new lineup is released on the first Tuesday of the month, with the games being revealed the previous Wednesday. Based on this pattern, we can expect an announcement for April's lineup on the morning of Wednesday, March 27th, and the new games will become available on Tuesday, April 2nd.

As of now, there haven't been any leaks or rumors regarding the essential games for April. I've searched for clues but haven't found anything substantial. Considering that there are no games releasing on April 2nd, it's highly unlikely that a new release will be included in the lineup. If any leaks or rumors do surface before Wednesday morning, I'll make sure to update this post. In the meantime, I have a slightly shorter list of predictions, although some of them may be wishful thinking. Additionally, it's possible that we might see a Simulator or sports game in the lineup.

Here are some of my predictions and wishful thinking titles for April's PlayStation Plus lineup:

1. Assassin's Creed Valhalla
2. Need For Speed Unbound
3. The Outer Worlds
4. Forspoken
5. Demon's Souls
6. The Order 1886
7. The Last Of Us Part 1
8. LEGO Jurassic World
9. Marvel's Midnight Suns
10. Tales of Arise
11. Cult Of The Lamb
12. Little Nightmares 2
13. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor
14. Nier: Automata
15. Elden Ring
16. Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice
17. Metal: Hellsinger
18. Donut County
19. Dead Island 2
20. Metro Exodus
21. Gollum
22. Skull Island: Rise Of Kong
23. The Walking Dead: Destinies

https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/24/new-whatsapp-warning-iphone-15-pro-max-samsung-s24-ultra-upgrade/,New WhatsApp Warning Suddenly Issued For 2 Billion Users,"WhatsApp is undergoing a major upgrade, and amidst all the changes happening in the messaging landscape, there's one setting that you should avoid using at all costs. This particular setting could have dangerous consequences for your WhatsApp account. So, what is this setting that you should steer clear of?

End-to-end encryption has been a vital feature of messaging apps like iMessage, WhatsApp, and Signal for years. It ensures that your conversations are secure and protected from prying eyes. Recently, Google Messages and Facebook Messenger have also made end-to-end encryption their default setting. However, it seems that some media reports are encouraging users to transfer their chats and chat history from WhatsApp to Telegram, which is a cause for concern.

Unlike WhatsApp, Telegram does not provide end-to-end encryption by default. Its ""secret chat"" option needs to be manually selected for each individual chat. This means that by moving your chats from WhatsApp, which is end-to-end encrypted, to Telegram, you are compromising the security of your conversations. This is especially risky for group chats that contain sensitive content shared by multiple users.

It's important to note that even WhatsApp, which is part of Mark Zuckerberg's data-hungry empire, uses end-to-end encryption by default. There's no need for users to take any additional steps to enable it. Messages are protected from all outsiders, including the service owners, right from the start.

When Telegram first promoted the migration of WhatsApp chats, I warned users about the potential dangers. While it may have seemed like an attractive option at the time, considering the backlash against WhatsApp's user terms and conditions changes, pulling content out of end-to-end encrypted messaging platforms removes the very barriers that are designed to protect your messages. Accessibility may be important, but not at the cost of security and privacy.

Telegram prides itself on being easy to use across different platforms, but that ease of use comes at the expense of end-to-end encryption. Telegram's architecture is designed for accessibility and simplicity, not for robust encryption. Your data's security relies on policies rather than advanced encryption technology.

Therefore, I strongly advise against following any advice to switch from WhatsApp to Telegram. Despite the marketing claims, it's a step backward in terms of security. Moreover, there are other concerns associated with Telegram that you should be aware of.

Telegram has a dual role in the messaging world. On one hand, it aims to be a user-friendly alternative to WhatsApp with a wide range of features, which is why the option to migrate chats exists. However, on the other hand, it has gained a reputation as a platform that attracts criminal activity. Spain's High Court recently suspended Telegram due to its lack of content controls, and there have been reports linking Telegram to the dark web and organized criminal networks.

While Telegram may be used by various groups, including activists and campaigners, its rise in popularity has also led to an increase in criminal activities on the platform. It has become an essential resource for organizing illicit activities. This raises concerns about the platform's integrity and the potential risks associated with using it.

In conclusion, it's crucial to prioritize the security and privacy of your conversations. Avoid switching from WhatsApp to Telegram, as it compromises the end-to-end encryption that protects your messages. Stick to messaging apps that prioritize security by default. Remember, convenience should never come at the expense of your privacy and safety.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65b41420a2b346798e66d370/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2207,1442,x681,y315,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 23:45:00,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/25/google-upgrade-samsung-s24-s23-pixel-towards-apple-iphone-15-pro-max/,Google Suddenly Reveals Surprise Android Update That Beats iPhone,"Android and iPhone are constantly competing to offer the best features and user experience. While Google is often seen as following Apple's lead, it has just surprised everyone by introducing a groundbreaking feature that is coming to Android first. This new update is set to bridge the gap between the two operating systems and revolutionize the way we use our smartphones.

One of the most exciting additions to Android is the emergency satellite service, which brings Android on par with Apple's satellite SOS functionality. This feature has been available on iPhones for a few years, providing a safety net for users in remote locations. However, Google's implementation takes it a step further by incorporating a Garmin rescue service into its plan. This means that Android users will now have access to a reliable and efficient emergency service, ensuring their safety and security.

But Google doesn't stop there. With the latest Android 15 developer preview, they are introducing a satellite add-on that allows users to expand their cellular accounts. This means that even in areas with poor or no cellular coverage, Android users can still stay connected through the satellite network. This is a game-changer for those who frequently find themselves in cellular black spots or areas with limited connectivity.

The update also includes improvements for messaging apps. Android 15 now allows SMS, MMS, and RCS apps to utilize satellite connectivity for sending and receiving messages. This means that even when traditional cellular networks are unavailable, Android users can still stay in touch with their contacts. This is a significant step towards a future where satellite connectivity becomes the norm, providing uninterrupted communication regardless of location.

It's worth noting that Apple's satellite connectivity is more limited compared to Android's offering. While Apple allows users to connect to a satellite for emergency services, roadside assistance, and location sharing, Android's integration goes beyond that. Google's partnership with T-Mobile opens up the potential for satellite messaging, enabling users to make calls and send messages directly through the satellite network. This is a significant development that will revolutionize the way we communicate in remote areas.

The possibility of direct-to-phone satellite connectivity becoming more widespread is exciting. Elon Musk's SpaceX has already achieved impressive download speeds to an unmodified Galaxy S21 Ultra, without the need for any special hardware. This means that smartphones could soon connect directly to satellites, providing communication capabilities in areas with no cellular network coverage. Starlink, SpaceX's satellite internet service, has been testing this technology, and it looks like we could see it in action in the coming months.

The integration of satellite messaging into Android 15 is a significant step forward. It not only enhances the user experience but also showcases Google's commitment to innovation. As Android and iPhone continue to evolve, it's clear that Google is leading the way, with Apple likely to follow suit. This comes on the heels of the news that Gemini, a powerful AI technology, might be coming to iPhone, further blurring the lines between the two operating systems.

In conclusion, Android's latest update brings exciting new features to the platform. The inclusion of an emergency satellite service and satellite messaging capabilities sets Android apart from its competitors. With Google taking the lead in innovation, it's only a matter of time before Apple catches up. The future of smartphone connectivity looks promising, with direct-to-phone satellite communication on the horizon.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65d79ec3dadcd6b682668331/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 00:06:15,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/24/see-the-moon-eclipsed-by-earth-as-americas-total-solar-eclipse-draws-near-the-night-sky-this-week/,See The Moon Begin Its ‘Eclipse Season:’ The Night Sky This Week,"The Night Sky This Week: March 25-31, 2024

North America is currently experiencing a golden age of eclipses, and this week marks a prelude to a significant event happening next week. In the early hours of Monday, March 25, the full worm moon will be partially eclipsed by Earth, resulting in a penumbral lunar eclipse. While it may not be a full ""blood moon"" total lunar eclipse, this moment is crucial because it sets the stage for a total solar eclipse on Monday, April 8, 2024. If you don't want to miss this incredible event, here are some planning tips to keep in mind.

Aside from these eclipses, there are other exciting celestial events happening in the night sky this week. The waning gibbous moon will pass close to a couple of bright stars as it rises later and later at night, making the early evening skies perfect for stargazing by the weekend.

Let's dive into the details of stargazing and astronomy this week:

Monday, March 25: 'Worm Moon Lunar Eclipse'

The third full moon of 2024, also known as the ""Worm Moon,"" marks the beginning of spring in the northern hemisphere. During this time, the moon will move through Earth's outer shadow in space, resulting in a slight penumbral lunar eclipse. This eclipse will be visible from the night side of Earth, including North and South America, Europe, East Asia, Australia, and New Zealand.

In New York, the eclipse will begin at 00:53 a.m. EDT and end at 05:32 a.m. EDT on Monday, March 25, with the maximum eclipse occurring at 03:12 a.m. EDT. In Los Angeles, the eclipse will start at 9:53 p.m. PDT on Sunday, March 24, and end at 02:32 a.m. PDT on Monday, March 25, with the maximum eclipse at 00:12 a.m. EDT.

Tuesday, March 26: Moon and Spica

A few hours after sunset, step outside and witness the almost full moon rising due east. This moonrise, however, holds something special. Just to the top right of the rising moon, you'll find the bright star Spica, the brightest star in the constellation Virgo and one of the 20 brightest stars in the night sky. It will be within 1.4 degrees of our natural satellite.

Saturday, March 30: Moon and Antares

If you're up late on Friday into the early hours of Saturday, cast your gaze towards the southeast. You'll be treated to a sight of a 78%-lit waning gibbous moon located less than a degree from Antares, a red supergiant star in the constellation Scorpius.

Galaxies of the Week: Bode's and the Cigar

Ursa Minor and Ursa Major, visible in the northern sky after dark this week, are home to two stunning galaxies that can be observed with an 8-inch telescope. 

M81, also known as Bode's galaxy, is a large spiral galaxy located approximately 12 million light-years away from Earth. It stands out as one of the brightest galaxies in the night sky. On the other hand, M82, also called the Cigar galaxy, is a starburst galaxy situated roughly 12 million light-years away from us. This galaxy is known for its high rate of star formation. When observing M82 through a telescope, you can spot its stars as small, diffuse patches of light northwest of the bright star Dubhe in the Big Dipper.

Eclipse Tip of the Week: Preparing for the Total Solar Eclipse

Less than two weeks from now, North America will witness a rare and breathtaking celestial event—a total solar eclipse. If you haven't made solid plans yet, now is the time to act. Remember, you must get into the path of totality (the yellow stripe on the map above) to fully experience this phenomenon. Simply being close to it won't make a practical difference. 

To assist you in your preparations, there are numerous articles available on my feed regarding where to stay and where to view the eclipse. Additionally, various websites offer maps, simulations, and event listings to help you plan your experience. Make sure to check the times and dates specific to your location by consulting online planetariums such as Stellarium and The Sky Live. These resources provide accurate information on planet-rise/planet-set, sunrise/sunset, and moonrise/moonset times for your area.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/non-sexy-industries-can-appeal-to-investors-too/,Non-sexy industries can appeal to investors too,"Welcome to TechCrunch Fintech! In this edition, we'll be highlighting some exciting fintech startups in Africa, discussing how the closure of Mint has benefitted Copilot, and exploring why venture capitalists are doubling down on an expense management startup. If you want to stay updated on the latest fintech stories, subscribe to our newsletter for a weekly roundup delivered straight to your inbox.

The Fintech Scene in Africa
Although venture funding in Africa has experienced a decline recently, the past week has been a positive one for the region's fintech ecosystem. Uber led a $100 million investment into African mobility fintech Moove, resulting in the startup's valuation reaching $750 million. Additionally, Zone raised $8.5 million to expand its decentralized payment infrastructure. Tanzanian payments company Nala successfully pivoted to offer remittance services in 2021 and also built a B2B payment platform. These developments demonstrate the growth and potential of fintech in Africa.

Opportunity Arises from Mint's Closure
The decision to shut down budgeting app Mint by Intuit has created opportunities for startups in the same space. Copilot, in particular, has experienced significant growth in the last four months, surpassing its growth in the previous four years. This growth led to a $6 million Series A funding round led by Nico Wittenborn's Adjacent. Copilot initially launched with $250,000 in angel funding and later added support for Apple Card. Monarch Money co-founder Ozzie Osman also expressed how Mint's closure has benefited their company.

Investing in Non-Sexy Industries
Expense management startup Coast has attracted investors despite being in a non-sexy industry. The startup focuses on serving businesses with real-world field personnel and fleets to manage. Coast saw a remarkable 550% revenue growth last year and recently secured an additional $25 million in equity funding. This success highlights the potential for innovation and growth in industries that may not receive as much attention from investors.

Onyx Private Pivots to B2B
Digital bank Onyx Private, backed by Y Combinator, initially aimed to serve high-earning millennials and Gen Zers. However, the startup recently announced that it would be terminating its bank operations and closing customer accounts. This pivot indicates a shift in focus towards B2B services.

Making Banking Accessible in Unstable Economies
Swiss fintech nsave has raised $4 million in seed funding to provide banking services to individuals in countries with unstable banking sectors or high inflation rates. By making banking accessible, nsave aims to empower individuals in these regions to manage their finances more efficiently.

The Future of Fintech
Despite the rapid growth of the fintech industry, there is still a vast untapped market. Ramp's co-founder and CEO, Eric Glyman, believes that the industry has only scratched the surface of its potential. Glyman predicts that there is much more room for growth and expansion, citing his own company's growth as evidence. Both Ramp and Deel, another fintech startup, recently celebrated their fifth anniversaries.

Antitrust Complaint Against Apple's Financial Business
The U.S. Justice Department's antitrust complaint against Apple targets the tech giant's extensive financial business. This complaint raises concerns about Apple's dominance and the potential anti-competitive practices in the fintech sector.
