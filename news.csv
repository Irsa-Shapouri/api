https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2024/03/24/wwdc-2024-date-exactly-when-apple-will-reveal-iphone-mac-and-ipad-software/,"WWDC 2024 Date: Exactly When Apple Will Reveal iPhone, Mac And iPad Software","Apple's highly anticipated annual developers' conference, known as WWDC or DubDub, is just around the corner. While the exact details haven't been announced yet, we can make some educated guesses based on previous years.

Typically, Apple announces the date of WWDC around this time. However, in the past couple of years, they revealed the date in late March or early April. So, we can expect the official announcement any day now. 

As for the timing, WWDC has always taken place in June, usually in the first full week of the month. Barring any disruptions like a pandemic, which hopefully won't be the case this year, we can anticipate it to follow the same pattern. In fact, based on previous years, it's likely to run from Monday, June 3 to Friday, June 7. However, it's also possible that it could be the following week, running from Monday, June 10 to Friday, June 14. This timeframe is still within the usual range for WWDC.

In terms of format, WWDC has undergone some changes since 2020. In that year, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the keynote was pre-recorded, and there were no in-person attendees. This was a significant departure from previous years when thousands of people gathered in a large auditorium to watch the keynote live.

Since then, Apple has continued to pre-record the keynote, but they have gradually increased the number of attendees at their Cupertino location. While the numbers are still lower than pre-Covid years, last year saw a higher attendance compared to the previous year.

Based on this trend, it's safe to assume that this year's WWDC will feature a pre-recorded keynote, with Tim Cook and Craig Federighi presenting live on stage at Apple Park. There will likely be some in-person attendees, including VIPs, press, staff, and a limited number of other attendees.

As for the timing of the keynote, Apple has a tradition of scheduling it for 10 a.m. local time, which means Pacific Daylight Time. This allows for maximum reach and ensures that people from different time zones can tune in conveniently.

Once Apple officially announces the details, you can expect me to provide a comprehensive report with all the necessary information. Stay tuned for more updates on WWDC 2024!",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600830c22fb840e0281afe2/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 16:00:15,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/krisholt/2024/03/24/nyt-connections-hints-and-answers-for-monday-march-25/,"NYT ‘Connections’ Hints And Answers For Monday, March 25","Welcome to today's game of Connections! If you're ready to challenge your word-linking skills, then let's dive right in.

In Connections, you'll be presented with a grid of 16 words. Your goal is to arrange them into four groups of four by finding the connections between them. These connections could be anything from horror movie franchises to types of verbs or even rappers.

But be careful! Some words might fit into multiple categories, so you'll need to think critically to find the right groups. Feel free to shuffle the words around to help you spot the connections.

Each group is color-coded, with yellow being the easiest, followed by blue and green, and finally purple, which is usually the most challenging. The purple group often involves wordplay, so keep that in mind as you tackle it.

To submit your answer, select four words that you believe go together and press Submit. If you guess incorrectly, you'll lose a life. If you're close to the correct group, you might receive a message telling you that you're only one word away, but you'll still need to figure out which word to swap.

Remember, four mistakes and it's game over. But don't worry, because I have some hints and answers to help you out if you're struggling.

Now, let's get to today's Connections hints!

Take your time scrolling through the hints for each group. I'll reveal what the groups are, but I won't immediately tell you which words belong to each group. This way, you can have a chance to figure it out on your own.

Here are today's 16 words:
- PACE
- CLIPPER
- MOVE
- MEDICINE
- FASTER
- PROMPTER
- ROCKET
- SPEED
- GO
- SPUR
- COMMUTE
- HURRY
- RATE
- VISION
- CLIP
- PACER

And here are the hints for today's groups:
- Yellow group: something's swiftness
- Green group: speed up!
- Blue group: NBA team player
- Purple group: linked by a term meaning ""over a long distance""

Need a little extra help? Well, here come the answers!

But hold on, because I don't want to spoil the fun just yet. Only scroll down if you're ready to reveal today's Connections answers.

Last chance to turn back!

Today's Connections answers are:
- Yellow group: how fast something is going (CLIP, PACE, RATE, SPEED)
- Green group: ""step on it!"" (FASTER, GO, HURRY, MOVE)
- Blue group: NBA team player (CLIPPER, PACER, ROCKET, SPUR)
- Purple group: tele____ (COMMUTE, MEDICINE, PROMPTER, VISION)

Unfortunately, there's no perfect game today, but my streak is up to five games in a row!

I quickly figured out the blues, even though I had a suspicion they might be a red herring. The greens and yellows were quite interesting, as they seemed to be the noun and verb versions of the same concept.

I initially included COMMUTE with the greens instead of FASTER, but after correcting that mistake, I successfully found the connection for the purples and achieved victory.

That's it for today's Connections clues and answers. If you need more hints or the solution for Tuesday's game, be sure to check out my blog.

Before we wrap up, here's a quick life tip for you: make it a point to dine at the best restaurant in your area at least once. Even if you have to save up for it, trust me, it'll be worth it. While takeout can be a nice treat, there's something special about experiencing the highest level of dining nearby. It's bound to create a memorable experience.

Now, go out there and conquer the world of Connections! Good luck!",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/64dbcee7d64da3663d88000e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 17:30:02,Innovation,Innovation

It's Monday, and we're back to the work week. Can you believe it's already the last week of March? Time really flies, especially when you're engrossed in puzzle games like Wordle!

This weekend, we experienced an odd weather phenomenon. Just as we were expecting sunny spring weather, it decided to surprise us with half a foot of snow. It's cold and wintry outside, and although I was hoping for warmer days, I can't deny that it's quite a picturesque scene.

But let's not get too distracted by the weather. It's time to get back to work and back to Wordling! So, let's dive into today's Wordle and figure out how to solve it.

Today's Hint and Clue: A Proper Noun and a Double Letter

Before we reveal the answer, let's go through the hint and clue for today's Wordle. The hint tells us that we usually think of the answer as a proper noun. This information can help narrow down our options.

Now, for the clue. Today's Wordle has a double letter. This clue is crucial because it gives us a specific detail to consider while guessing.

And now, the moment you've been waiting for...

Today's Answer: [Answer]

Wordle Analysis: The Journey to the Answer

Every day, I eagerly check Wordle Bot to see how I fared. If you haven't tried it yet, Wordle Bot is a great tool to validate your Wordle attempts.

I must admit, today's Wordle had me stumped at first. I started off on the wrong foot, with numerous possibilities still on the table even after a few attempts. But then, a breakthrough happened.

The word ""allay"" turned out to be a valuable guess. It informed me that there was more than one 'L' in the answer, which significantly narrowed down the options. With just one word remaining, I came close to guessing ""palsy"" before realizing that I needed a second 'L'. After some brainstorming, I finally settled on ""sally."" Although I usually associate it with a name, it is also an antiquated term for a battle tactic.

Competitive Wordle Score: A Wash

Unfortunately, today's Wordle didn't yield any points for me. I didn't guess the answer in four attempts, nor did I tie with the Bot. So, it's a big zero for me this time.

The Etymology of ""Sally""

Now, let's delve into the etymology of today's Wordle answer: ""sally."" In a non-proper noun context, ""sally"" means to suddenly rush forth or make a sudden attack from a defensive position. It can also refer to setting out on a journey or venture.

The word ""sally"" has an interesting etymological journey, tracing back through several languages before arriving in English. It originated from the Middle French word ""sallie,"" which is the noun form of ""sallir,"" meaning ""to rush out, leap forth."" ""Sallir"" itself comes from the Latin word ""salire,"" which means ""to leap."" This Latin root has given rise to various related words in English, such as ""salient"" (prominently projecting) and ""assail"" (to attack), all reflecting the idea of movement or leaping forth.

The etymology of ""sally"" showcases the action of moving out or leaping forth, often with a sense of suddenness or unexpectedness. It can apply to physical attacks from a fortified position or embarking on a journey or new venture.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewwight/2024/03/24/helping-patients-access-sickle-cell-disease-treatments-in-west-africa/,Helping Patients Access Sickle Cell Disease Treatments In West Africa,"A researcher from Cameroon is on a mission to help patients in low-income countries in West Africa access affordable medicine for sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease affects over 4 million people worldwide, with 80% of cases occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. Unfortunately, 89% of women in central and west Africa lack access to universal medical coverage. Dr. Marthe-Sandrine Eiymo Mwa Mpollo, a scientist and co-founder of NaYa Health, understands that having a drug for sickle cell disease is not enough if patients cannot afford it.

Inspired by the need for affordable medication, Dr. Mpollo founded NaYa Health, a digital patient assistance platform. NaYa Health aims to help underserved patients without insurance have timely access to medication through community savings, deferred payments, and a portable health-only savings account. In a pilot implementation in Cameroon's capital, NaYa Health has already made a significant impact. Informal workers now have increased resilience and are better equipped to handle unexpected challenges. Local medical providers have seen an increase in income, and critical services are more accessible.

NaYa Health's efforts have not gone unnoticed. The organization was selected in the financial inclusion challenge by MIT Solve. Dr. Mpollo is proud to fulfill the promise of research findings by enabling patients with sickle cell disease in Cameroon to access the medicines they need, even when they are short on cash. It is clear that access to medication is crucial for research to realize its full life-saving potential.

Dr. Mpollo's passion for medicine in Cameroon stems from her childhood experiences. Growing up, she watched shows about ""doctors without borders"" and witnessed the impact of sickle cell disease on families in her community. These experiences ignited a desire to bring healthcare to challenged communities. Although her initial plan was to become a medical doctor, her journey led her to life science research in Canada and the US. Here, she obtained a doctorate and focused on developing therapies for sickle cell disease.

After publishing scientific papers and communicating research findings, Dr. Mpollo realized that access to medication is the key to saving lives. This realization led to the launch of NaYa Health. She believes that scientists from the Global South have a unique perspective on the limitations and needs of their communities. By tailoring their research to be more impactful for their communities, scientists can work with local actors to define or adapt distribution models for scientific findings.

In Zambia, another team of entrepreneurs, researchers, and health professionals is using artificial intelligence to improve care for pregnant women. Despite a decrease in the death rate for pregnant mothers, Zambian women still face a 1% risk of dying during pregnancy or childbirth. Tafadzwa Kalisto Munzwa, founder and CEO of Dawa Health, is leading the DawaMom project, which harnesses AI tools, last-mile health workers, mobile clinics, and digital tools to enhance maternal and child health. Over 60 community health workers are supporting in-community healthcare through DawaMom, and more than 800 mothers have signed up on the mobile platform.

The generative AI models used by DawaMom are patient-facing and respond to patient needs. These AI tools provide personalized care and guidance to pregnant women, ensuring they receive the support they need throughout their pregnancy journey. The combination of AI technology, last-mile health workers, and mobile clinics allows for comprehensive and accessible healthcare for expectant mothers in Zambia.

Both NaYa Health and DawaMom are examples of innovative solutions that aim to address healthcare challenges in low-income countries. By leveraging digital platforms, community engagement, and AI technology, these organizations are making a significant impact on the lives of patients and improving healthcare outcomes. Access to affordable medication and personalized care is crucial in ensuring that everyone, regardless of their financial situation, can lead a healthy life. With continued efforts and advancements in healthcare technology, we can strive for a future where healthcare is accessible to all.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66009a73668df974c31e0a4f/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=579,579,x127,y431,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 17:54:08,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/non-sexy-industries-can-appeal-to-investors-too/,Non-sexy industries can appeal to investors too,"Welcome to TechCrunch Fintech! In this edition, we'll be exploring some exciting fintech startups in Africa, discussing how Mint's closure has benefited Copilot, and delving into why venture capitalists are showing increased interest in a particular expense management startup.

Africa's fintech ecosystem has experienced a decline in venture funding recently, mirroring global trends. However, last week brought some positive news for the region. Uber led a $100 million investment into Moove, an African mobility fintech startup, resulting in a valuation of $750 million. Additionally, Zone secured $8.5 million in funding to expand its decentralized payment infrastructure. Tanzanian payments company Nala successfully pivoted to offer remittance services in 2021 and also launched a B2B payment platform.

Intuit's decision to close down budgeting app Mint has created opportunities for other startups in the space. Copilot, in particular, has experienced significant growth in the past four months, surpassing its growth over the previous four years. This growth led to a $6 million Series A funding round led by Nico Wittenborn's Adjacent. Copilot initially received $250,000 in angel funding and later added support for Apple Card. Monarch Money co-founder Ozzie Osman also expressed how Mint's closure benefited their company.

Expense management startup Coast has demonstrated that even non-sexy industries can attract investors. The company focuses on serving businesses with real-world field personnel and fleets to manage. It achieved a remarkable 550% revenue growth last year and recently secured an additional $25 million in equity funding.

Digital bank Onyx Private, backed by Y Combinator, originally targeted high-earning millennials and Gen Zers. However, it has announced a pivot to focus on B2B operations. As a result, the bank is terminating its current operations and closing customer accounts.

Swiss fintech nsave is making banking accessible in Switzerland to individuals in countries with unstable banking sectors or high inflation. The company has raised $4 million in seed funding to support its mission.

In a recent interview on the TechCrunch Found podcast, Eric Glyman, co-founder and CEO of Ramp, expressed his belief that the fintech industry, including his own company, is only scratching the surface of its potential. Despite Ramp's significant growth as a corporate card and expense startup, Glyman estimates that they have tapped into only 1% of their potential market share. Interestingly, both Ramp and Deel celebrated their fifth anniversaries this week, just one day apart.

The U.S. Justice Department's antitrust complaint against Apple and its iPhone business specifically targets Apple's extensive financial operations.

In other news, Bolt and Checkout.com have formed an unexpected partnership to facilitate frictionless commerce. Rewards startup Fetch has raised $50 million from Morgan Stanley, taking advantage of the private credit boom. Wealthfront has postponed its plans for an IPO. Keith Rabois, a director at Affirm Holdings, has sold shares worth over $318,000. Cloud banking tech provider nCino has acquired DocFox. Marco has raised $12 million to support trade finance in Latin America. PayPal-backed NX Technologies has raised $24 million to streamline automotive payments. Prizepool has received a cease and desist order from the FDIC for false and misleading statements. Pedro Arnt has been appointed as CEO of DLocal, with Sebastián Kanovich stepping back. Ryan Zauk has joined OMERS Ventures as a fintech investor. Klarna has set its sights on Visa and Mastercard with its open banking push.
