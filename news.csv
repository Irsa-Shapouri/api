Request an invite here.

In the world of venture capital, there is a saying that it's ""venture money, not adventure money."" This quote highlights the caution that VCs exercise when evaluating ideas. However, when a new technology enters the hype cycle, that caution often goes out the window. VCs feel pressured to deploy their capital and fear missing out on the next big thing. This same dynamic can be seen within companies as well, especially when it comes to AI.

AI and anything remotely associated with it have become the technology of the moment. Large language models (LLMs) and machine learning (ML) are all considered part of the AI umbrella. This has led to a frenzy of AI-related projects and investments, with billions of dollars being poured into the technology. But is all this spending justified?

In reality, a significant portion of the AI investments made today will go to waste. This is not a contrarian take; it is simply a recognition that every major technology wave comes with excitement before its true impact is fully understood. While technologies like search, social media, and mobile have had a lasting impact, others like virtual reality (VR) and crypto have fallen short of expectations.

Five years ago, headlines were filled with promises of how AI would change everything. Today, companies are rushing to show how much they are investing in AI. However, this shotgun approach to investing in AI inevitably leads to a few big successes and many failures. The fear of missing out drives companies to greenlight AI projects that are often based on misplaced hope and unrealistic expectations.

This is not to say that LLMs are not a game-changing technology. Just look at how quickly ChatGPT reached 100 million users compared to other transformative companies. The potential of LLMs and AI is undeniable. But how can companies navigate this hype-driven landscape and make smart investments?

There are three key factors to consider:

1. Understand the total cost over time: Before saying yes to an AI project, consider the resources needed to sustain it over time. Often, the initial work from a data science team is just the tip of the iceberg. There is a significant amount of engineering, DevOps, QA, product management, and SysOps work that goes into maintaining an AI project. Many companies have started projects that were initially promising but lacked ongoing investment, leading to their eventual demise. Saying no to an AI initiative is difficult, but frequent yeses can come at the expense of fully funding projects that truly deserve support.

Additionally, it's important to consider the increasing marginal cost of AI. Large models are expensive to train, run, and maintain. Using AI excessively without a corresponding increase in value can eat into profit margins. Furthermore, scaling back or canceling promised functionality can damage customer satisfaction and tarnish a company's reputation.

2. Ask why no one else can do it: The tech industry can be divided into monopolies and commodities. When considering an AI initiative, ask yourself why your company is uniquely positioned to succeed in that particular area. If the project commoditizes over time, it may not be sustainable in the long run, especially if you lack the scale or cost advantage. To avoid this, focus on areas where you have a defensive moat, such as preferential access to data, proprietary insights, or strong network effects.

3. Make a few strategic bets: Instead of spreading your resources thin across multiple AI projects, focus on a few initiatives that can genuinely enhance your existing business. Look for opportunities to make the things you already do better with the application of AI. By doing so, you can leverage your existing strengths and create momentum in your industry.

In conclusion, while the hype around AI is real and the potential is immense, it's crucial to approach AI investments with a clear-eyed perspective. Understand the total cost over time, consider why your company is uniquely positioned to succeed, and make strategic bets that align with your core business. By doing so, you can avoid wasting resources and maximize the value AI can bring to your organization.",https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/An_AI_sitting_in_a_corner_curled_up_looking_sa-transformed.jpeg?w=1200&strip=all,2024-03-24 18:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikestubbs/2024/03/24/new-valorant-agent-clove-can-come-back-from-the-dead/,New ‘Valorant’ Agent Clove Can Come Back From The Dead,"Clove, the 25th agent in Valorant, was recently unveiled at the Valorant Masters Madrid tournament by Riot Games. This new agent brings a unique set of abilities to the game, including the ability to come back from the dead. With their focus on disruption and utility, Clove is sure to make a significant impact on the battlefield. Let's take a closer look at their abilities and how they can be used effectively.

First up is Clove's E ability, Ruse. This ability allows Clove to create smoke screens similar to those of Brimstone. By bringing up a small window, players can select an area of the map to drop the smoke, blocking vision for enemies. What sets Ruse apart is the ability to use it even when Clove is dead. This adds an extra level of utility and makes Clove more useful than they may initially appear.

Next is Clove's Q ability, Meddle. This ability is a grenade-like throwable that inflicts decay on enemies hit by it. While it may seem less impactful than other abilities, it can still be a useful tool in disrupting enemy movements and weakening their overall effectiveness.

Clove's C ability, Pick-Me-Up, is similar to Reyna's kit. When Clove eliminates an enemy, they can absorb their life essence, gaining haste and a temporary health buff. This ability provides a valuable advantage in battles, giving Clove the ability to sustain themselves and continue their assault on the enemy team.

Finally, we come to Clove's ultimate ability, the most intriguing of all. When Clove dies and their ultimate is ready, they can quickly cast it to come back to life for a limited time. If they manage to get a kill or assist during this resurrection period, they will be fully revived as if they never died. However, if they fail to secure a kill or assist, they will return to the grave once the timer runs out. This unique ability adds an element of risk and reward to Clove's gameplay, making them a formidable force even after death.

It's clear that Clove brings a new level of versatility to the game. With the ability to disrupt enemies, provide utility to their team, and even come back from the dead, Clove is a force to be reckoned with. Their smokes and post-death abilities make them an excellent entry fragger, reducing the risk of dying and enhancing their overall effectiveness.

Dan Hardison, agent gameplay designer on Valorant, explains the optimal gameplay for Clove, stating, ""Optimal Clove gameplay is about playing with fire, you need to take risks and trade your own life for the greater good to remove enemy utility from the round by killing opponents to have success."" Hardison goes on to explain that Clove's ability to contribute post-death means players should always fight to the death rather than retreat. By being willing to die for the squad, Clove can make the most significant impact on the game.

In conclusion, Clove is an exciting addition to the Valorant agent lineup. With their disruptive abilities, ability to come back from the dead, and unique playstyle, Clove brings a fresh and engaging gameplay experience to the game. Whether you're a fan of controllers or looking for a new agent to master, Clove is sure to provide hours of thrilling gameplay. So get ready to embrace the fire and trade your life for the greater good with Clove, the new Valorant agent.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff3fefa4d4cfc35a9fc1fe/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 11:15:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2024/03/24/unveiling-the-journey-of-a-social-media-influencer/,Unveiling The Journey Of A Social Media Influencer,"In today's digital age, social media has become a powerful tool for individuals to express themselves, connect with others, and even build careers. Many people have embraced the role of social media influencer, using platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube to share their experiences and insights with a wide audience. But how does one become a social media influencer? And what impact does this newfound influence have on their lives?

When I reflect on my own journey as a social media influencer, I realize that I initially had a somewhat naive perspective on the power and potential of social media. Like many others, I had always used social media to casually post my thoughts and selfies, without any real intention behind it. However, as I began to share my personal stories, struggles, and triumphs, something incredible happened - my audience started to grow.

The turning point came when I made the conscious decision to be more vulnerable and relatable in my content. I wanted to create posts that would truly resonate with others, offering them something of value. This shift in approach was not only beneficial to my followers, but it also had a profound impact on my own life. I discovered that by sharing my experiences, strengths, and hopes, I was able to connect with thousands of people who were going through similar challenges. This realization fueled my passion and motivated me to continue using social media as a platform for positive change.

Of course, social media is not without its flaws. It is often criticized for being a breeding ground for negativity and online bullying. I, too, have witnessed this dark side of social media. However, instead of allowing it to discourage me, I decided to adopt a simple formula to guide my content creation. Before posting anything, I ask myself three questions: Will this be helpful? Is this something I want to put out into the world? And is this something that I need to hear myself? If a particular post meets all three criteria, I know it is worth sharing.

This approach has not only helped me maintain a positive and uplifting online presence, but it has also attracted a supportive and like-minded community. I consider myself incredibly fortunate to have cultivated a following that is largely free from hate and negativity. Although I am aware that many influencers face criticism and adversity, I believe that my personal mantra, ""Negativity Be Gone,"" has played a significant role in creating a shield against negativity. This phrase serves as a reminder that I no longer welcome or entertain negativity in my life, and as a result, I have opened myself up to a world filled with positivity and inspiration.

Undeniably, social media has transformed my life in profound ways. It has served as a stepping stone for building my career, providing me with endless opportunities for growth and connection. Through social media, I have gained invaluable knowledge, connected with like-minded individuals, and even formed meaningful partnerships. It truly has been a breath of fresh air, infusing my life with a sense of purpose and fulfillment.

In conclusion, becoming a social media influencer has been a transformative experience for me. It has allowed me to share my story, connect with others, and make a positive impact on the world. While social media certainly has its challenges, I have found that by approaching it with authenticity, vulnerability, and a commitment to spreading positivity, it can be a powerful force for good. So, if you're considering becoming a social media influencer, I encourage you to embrace the opportunity, use your platform wisely, and let your voice be heard.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fa921a8a459a2ef2abbef0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 11:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/grrlscientist/2024/03/24/birding-under-the-influence-by-dorian-anderson---review/,Birding Under The Influence By Dorian Anderson - Review,"Birding Under the Influence: A Journey of Healing and Discovery

In the memoir Birding Under the Influence: Cycling Across America in Search of Birds and Recovery, author Dorian Anderson takes readers on a captivating journey of self-discovery and healing from addiction. This engaging and hopeful memoir combines a love for bird-watching and a cross-country bicycle trip to create a unique narrative that explores the depths of addiction and the power of nature to bring about transformation.

Dorian Anderson, a neuroscientist, embarks on a year-long quest to see as many bird species as possible, known as a Big Year in the birding community. Leaving behind his high-powered research career and the grip of alcohol and drug addiction, he sets out on a solo adventure across the Lower 48 states on his bicycle. This decision is fueled by his addictive Type-A personality, which he redirects towards healthier pursuits.

The idea of a bicycling Big Year takes root in Anderson's imagination after an enjoyable eight-mile bike trip to Nantucket, Massachusetts, to spot two Northern Lapwings. Despite his lack of experience with long-distance cycling, he is determined to make it a reality.

From the moment Anderson leaves Boston on New Year's Day in 2014, his physical journey is fraught with dangers and challenges. He braves cycling through snowstorms during a polar vortex in Massachusetts, narrowly avoids accidents on the Cross Bronx Expressway in New York City, endures extreme winds that threaten to blow him off the road, encounters aggressive motorists and long-haul truckers, and faces countless encounters with angry dogs. Along the way, he experiences 34 flat tires and various other biking mishaps. Despite these obstacles, he finds solace in the breathtaking beauty of the American landscape, from the Florida Everglades and the Rocky Mountains of Colorado to the Redwood forests of Oregon.

Long-distance bicycling provides Anderson with ample time for self-reflection, allowing him to delve into his past, his addiction, and his aspirations. Throughout the narrative, he shares insightful vignettes about his academic achievements, scientific research, and his ongoing battle with alcohol and drugs. As he pushes his physical and psychological limits, he begins to envision a future free from the grip of addiction.

Anderson's nightly blog about his adventures on the road attracts the attention of a unique group of birders across the country. These birders offer him meals, a place to stay, and warm showers, providing a glimpse into the diverse subcultures found throughout America. These interactions add depth to the narrative and highlight the kindness and generosity of strangers.

Over the course of twelve months, Anderson bicycles an astonishing 17,830 miles through 28 states. He also walks at least 493 miles, although he suspects the actual distance may be three times greater. Additionally, he kayaks eight miles in pursuit of birds, both common and rare. Along the way, he raises almost $50,000 for bird habitat conservation. His physical fitness improves significantly, with a resting heart rate below 40 beats per minute.

Throughout his journey, Anderson spots a total of 618 bird species. On Thanksgiving Day, as his Big Year draws to a close, he even documents a species never before reported in the United States: a female/juvenile red-legged honeycreeper. This remarkable discovery attracts local birders, who abandon their Thanksgiving feasts to catch a glimpse of this beautiful vagrant rarity at Estero Llaño Grande State Park.

While Birding Under the Influence is generally well-written, tighter editing could have improved the prose and smoothed the transitions between adventure and self-reflection. Despite this, Anderson's raw and honest storytelling captivates readers, allowing them to share in the wonder of his birding adventure and his existential struggles.

One aspect that could have enhanced the book is the inclusion of maps detailing Anderson's journey. These maps would have made it easier for readers to follow along and visualize his cross-country adventure. Additionally, a final state-by-state summary of the bird species he encountered would have been a valuable addition.

Birding Under the Influence is an uplifting memoir that showcases the power of nature to heal and transform. Anderson's journey of self-discovery and addiction recovery, combined with his passion for birding, creates a narrative that is both engaging and inspiring. This memoir serves as a reminder of the beauty and wonder that can be found in the natural world and the potential for personal growth and healing when one connects with it.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff194d2ccb9152d392146c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=812,456,x0,y57,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 12:17:44,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/omerawan/2024/03/24/children-in-gaza-are-starving-heres-how-starvation-can-affect-a-childs-health/,Here’s How Starvation And Malnutrition Can Affect A Child’s Health,"In the midst of the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, the situation in Gaza has reached a catastrophic level. According to reports from the United Nations, over 31,000 Palestinians, including 12,300 children, have lost their lives since the conflict began in October of last year. However, it's not just the bombs that are causing these deaths. The cutoff of food supplies has led to a devastating situation where Palestinians are dying from starvation, malnutrition, and dehydration.

The consequences of malnutrition and starvation are grim. When the body doesn't receive the essential nutrients it needs to function properly, malnutrition occurs. Starvation, on the other hand, happens when the body doesn't receive enough calories to sustain its essential functions. If left untreated, both conditions can lead to severe illness, organ failure, and ultimately death.

Children are particularly vulnerable to the effects of decreased caloric and nutrient intake. One of the most visible consequences is stunted growth. In a state of starvation, the body prioritizes survival over growth, resulting in low body weight and shorter height in malnourished children.

Furthermore, starvation and malnutrition weaken the immune system, making children more susceptible to infections such as pneumonia, gut infections, and malaria. The lack of essential vitamins in their bodies further compromises their ability to fight off infections. For example, vitamin C stimulates the production of white blood cells, which are crucial for combating infections. Without adequate vitamin C and other essential vitamins, their immune function is severely compromised.

The effects of starvation and malnutrition extend beyond the immune system. They also have profound impacts on the heart and cardiovascular system. When the body is starved, it breaks down muscle for survival, including the heart muscle. Over time, the heart weakens and becomes unable to efficiently pump blood throughout the body. Additionally, malnourished children often have imbalances in critical nutrients and electrolytes that are essential for optimal heart function. The lack of potassium, for instance, increases the risk of abnormal heart rhythms, known as arrhythmias, which can be fatal in some cases.

Not only do the consequences of starvation have immediate effects, but they can also lead to long-term heart complications. A study published in Frontiers in Public Health found that individuals who experienced early-life exposure to the Chinese famine had an increased risk of hospitalization for heart failure in adulthood. The study compared the risk of developing heart failure in those born before, during, and after the Chinese famine (1959-1962) and found a clear association between famine exposure and heart complications later in life.

Beyond the physical ailments, starvation has severe implications for a child's cognitive and intellectual growth. When the brain is deprived of the nutrients it needs to function properly, it can result in decreased attention, memory loss, suboptimal problem-solving skills, irritability, depression, mood swings, and anxiety. Starving children often struggle academically, which can hinder their long-term career prospects and economic opportunities. Moreover, the long-term consequences of malnutrition can contribute to various mental health disorders, including anxiety and depression, which are often associated with substance abuse, suicide, and shortened life spans.

The health ramifications of starvation are devastating for the innocent children of Gaza, who have no involvement in the political conflicts between Israel and Hamas. How many more children must suffer and die from malnutrition before the world comes together in solidarity to demand an urgent ceasefire and provide much-needed humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza?

Both the Jewish and Islamic traditions share the belief that saving one life is equivalent to saving all of humanity. It is time for the world to unite and save as many children as possible.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65f72ef1f1dfd894d878d074/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 10:59:35,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/technology/article/moba-games/,Top Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) Games,"MOBAs, or multiplayer online battle arena games, have become incredibly popular over the past 15 years. What started as a simple modification for a popular strategy game has evolved into a genre of its own, with standalone iterations vying to be the top MOBA games in the world. While many challengers have fallen by the wayside, the giants in the industry continue to attract millions of players each month. However, finding the best MOBA for you can still be a challenge if you don't know where to look.

So, what exactly is a multiplayer online battle arena game? A MOBA is an online game that pits two teams, usually consisting of five players, against each other in a strategic battle to destroy the opponent's base using unique player-controlled characters. These games are typically played on PC or mobile devices and have gained popularity due to their difficult-to-master gameplay.

The MOBA genre originated as a mod for Warcraft III, a popular strategy game with a thriving modding scene. Defence of the Ancients (DotA) is widely recognized as the first MOBA and, despite being a mod, became a major game in its own right. Some members of the DotA mod team eventually left to create their own MOBA, which became known as League of Legends and instantly became a hit. Valve, the developers of the Steam games platform, also joined the MOBA scene by acquiring members of the original DotA team to develop Dota 2, a competitor to League of Legends. This marked the beginning of a phase where major publishers attempted to create their own MOBAs, but most failed to gain traction.

Over the years, hundreds of MOBAs have been released across various platforms. Some have become immensely popular and have stood the test of time, while others have been forgotten within months. The top MOBA games today are the ones that have a unique offering or have managed to build a large and loyal audience. It's no surprise that some of the best MOBAs have been around for over a decade and are still innovating in a genre that has seen numerous copycats. These games have received critical acclaim and continue to provide a great gaming experience.

Dota 2, the direct sequel to the original DotA mod, has been one of the most popular games on Steam for over 10 years. While it was technically released in 2013, it was available in beta form in 2011. Developed by Valve with the involvement of Ice Frog, the lead developer of the original DotA mod, Dota 2 has evolved significantly over the years while retaining the core gameplay of two teams of five battling across a three-lane map to defeat the enemy's Ancient. Dota 2 is often considered one of the most complex games in the world, with a steep learning curve and mechanics that can take thousands of hours to master. It is free to play, with optional microtransactions for cosmetic items.

League of Legends, on the other hand, is the biggest MOBA in the world, boasting over 100 million monthly active players. Its release in 2009 kickstarted the MOBA craze and set the standard for the genre. Riot Games, the developer of League of Legends, was founded by a group of developers from the original DotA mod who wanted to create a standalone game. Their vision was to simplify some of the more complex aspects of DotA and make it more accessible to newcomers. The result was a slightly less complex version of the MOBA format, featuring the basic three-lane map and teams of five battling to destroy the enemy's base. While League of Legends may be less complex than Dota 2, it still offers a challenging gameplay experience and has become a global phenomenon.

In conclusion, MOBAs have taken the gaming world by storm, with their strategic gameplay and competitive nature attracting millions of players. Dota 2 and League of Legends are two of the most popular and influential MOBAs, each with their own unique features and dedicated fan bases. Whether you're a seasoned MOBA player or new to the genre, these games offer endless hours of excitement and competition. So, dive into the world of MOBAs and find the one that suits your playstyle and preferences.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fb05c9fa323af23f667c73/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 14:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
