This discovery has significant implications for creating sustainable energy sources.

The team of international researchers designed a material composed of copper anchored on nanocrystalline carbon nitride. The copper atoms are embedded within the nanocrystalline structure, allowing electrons to move from carbon nitride to CO2. This electron transfer is a crucial step in the production of methanol from CO2 under the influence of solar irradiation. The research has been published in the Sustainable Energy & Fuels journal.

Photocatalysis is a process in which light is shone on a semiconductor material, exciting electrons and enabling them to react with CO2 and water to produce various useful products, including methanol. However, this process has faced challenges in terms of efficiency and selectivity.

CO2 is a major contributor to global warming, and while it is possible to convert it into useful products, traditional thermal methods rely on hydrogen sourced from fossil fuels. Therefore, alternative methods based on photo- and electrocatalysis, harnessing solar energy and abundant water sources, are crucial.

Dr. Madasamy Thangamuthu, a research fellow at the University of Nottingham's School of Chemistry and co-leader of the research team, explains the importance of the photocatalyst absorbing light and efficiently separating charge carriers. The team's approach involves controlling the material at the nanoscale, developing a new form of carbon nitride with crystalline nanoscale domains that allow efficient interaction with light and effective charge separation.

To optimize the functional properties of carbon nitride for photocatalysis, the researchers heated it to the required degree of crystallinity. They then used magnetron sputtering to deposit atomic copper on the carbon nitride. This solventless process ensured close contact between the semiconductor and metal atoms.

The experimental work conducted by Tara LeMercier, a Ph.D. student at the University of Nottingham School of Chemistry, demonstrated that the new form of carbon nitride is 44 times more active than traditional carbon nitride, even without the addition of copper. Surprisingly, the addition of just 1 mg of copper per 1 g of carbon nitride quadrupled the efficiency of the process. Furthermore, the selectivity changed from producing methane, another greenhouse gas, to methanol, a valuable green fuel.

Professor Andrei Khlobystov from the School of Chemistry at the University of Nottingham emphasizes the importance of carbon dioxide valorization in achieving the UK's net-zero ambition. The sustainability of catalyst materials is crucial for this reaction, and the new catalyst composed of carbon, nitrogen, and copper is advantageous due to the abundance of these elements on our planet.

This breakthrough represents a significant step towards understanding photocatalytic materials in CO2 conversion. It opens doors to the development of highly selective and tunable catalysts, allowing for the production of desired products by controlling the catalyst at the nanoscale.

In conclusion, the researchers have successfully transformed CO2 into methanol using sunlight and copper atoms. This discovery has immense potential for creating sustainable green fuels. By designing a material composed of copper anchored on nanocrystalline carbon nitride, the team has enabled efficient electron transfer, leading to the production of methanol. This breakthrough paves the way for further advancements in the field of green energy and contributes to the global effort to combat climate change.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/research-lights-up-pro.jpg,2024-03-25 20:10:01,Innovation,Innovation
