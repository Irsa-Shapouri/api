https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-vulnerability-virtual-reality.html,Vulnerability in virtual reality systems identified,"Virtual reality (VR) systems have revolutionized the way we interact with technology, allowing us to immerse ourselves in virtual worlds and experience things beyond our imagination. However, a team of computer scientists from the University of Chicago has recently uncovered a potential vulnerability in VR systems that could pose a serious threat to users' security and privacy. They have named this vulnerability ""inception attacks"" and have published a paper detailing their findings on the arXiv preprint server.

The concept behind inception attacks is quite intriguing. It involves the insertion of an ""inception layer"" between a user's VR Home Screen and their VR User/Server. This layer acts as a simulated VR app that deceives users into behaving in ways that could potentially compromise their sensitive information. To better understand this vulnerability, let's delve into the details.

Imagine a scenario where a hacker manages to add an app to a user's VR headset without their knowledge. This malicious app creates a layer of reality that is altered, making the user perceive a virtual world that is different from what they would normally see. Similar to the movie ""Inception,"" where characters experience a manipulated layer of reality, this app tricks users into interacting with a false virtual environment.

The implications of such an inception layer are alarming. Hackers could exploit this vulnerability to record sensitive information, such as passcodes entered into a virtual ATM. They could also intercept and modify information, such as altering the amount of cash designated for a purchase and redirecting the difference to their own bank account. Additionally, the app could introduce virtual representations of friends or family members to gain the user's trust or access their secrets. In essence, it can monitor or manipulate gestures, voice commands, browsing activity, and social or business interactions within the VR world.

To demonstrate the feasibility of this type of attack, the research team conducted an experiment involving 28 volunteers. These volunteers were asked to play a game using a demonstration VR headset. The researchers then surreptitiously downloaded the app onto the devices, simulating a hacking scenario. Surprisingly, only 10 of the volunteers noticed a slight flickering during the download and activation process. Out of those 10, only one questioned whether something suspicious was occurring.

Upon discovering this potential vulnerability, the research team promptly informed Meta, the company behind the Meta Quest VR system used in the experiment. Meta has committed to investigating the issue and resolving it if confirmed. However, it is important to note that these vulnerabilities are likely to exist in other VR systems and various types of apps that attempt to insert themselves between users and their VR devices.

In conclusion, the emergence of virtual reality technology has opened up exciting possibilities, but it has also brought about new security challenges. Inception attacks represent a significant threat to users' privacy and can have far-reaching consequences. As VR continues to evolve, it is crucial for both researchers and VR system developers to remain vigilant and address these vulnerabilities to ensure a safe and secure virtual experience for all users.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/karlfreund/2024/03/25/cerebras-update-the-wafer-scale-engine-3-is-a-door-opener/,Cerebras Update: The Wafer Scale Engine 3 Is A Door Opener,"Cerebras recently hosted an AI Day event that drew a packed crowd, despite the simultaneous occurrence of the GTC conference. Unlike many other startups in the AI training space, Cerebras Systems has managed to gain significant traction with a select group of clients. At the event, they unveiled the third generation of their Wafer-Scale Engines (WSE), a powerful chip that outperforms racks of GPUs. Additionally, they announced a partnership with Qualcomm for custom training and collaboration in the Edge AI market. In this blog post, we will delve into the highlights of Cerebras' AI Day, while also addressing the challenges that lie ahead for this ambitious startup.

The third generation of wafer-scale engines, including the WSE-3 and the CS-3 system, is a remarkable engineering feat. While Cerebras often compares its chip to a single GPU, the true intention is to simplify the scaling process. Why go through the complexity of cutting up a wafer of chips, packaging them individually with HBM, connecting them to CPUs with a fabric, and then linking everything using networking chips and cables? Cerebras believes they have a better solution in mind.

Andrew Feldman, the CEO and co-founder of Cerebras, expressed his pride in introducing the third generation of their groundbreaking wafer-scale AI chip. The WSE-3 is the fastest AI chip in the world, specifically designed to handle cutting-edge AI workloads, such as mixture of experts and 24 trillion parameter models. Cerebras is excited to bring the WSE-3 and CS-3 to the market as a means of solving today's most significant AI challenges.

In terms of transistor count, GPUs won't catch up to the WSE-3 for at least six years, according to Cerebras' calculations. The WSE-3 is 57 times larger than Nvidia's H100, with 52 times more cores, 800 times more on-chip memory, 7,000 times more memory bandwidth, and over 3,700 times more fabric bandwidth. These impressive specifications serve as the foundation for the chip's exceptional performance.

The true magic of the WSE lies in its ability to enable software to treat a large cluster as a single instance, eliminating the need for distributed computing coding efforts. By streaming the weights of massive models instead of storing them on-chip, Cerebras' MemoryX and SwarmX interconnect can integrate up to 2048 CS-2 servers into a theoretical cluster. The creation of such a cluster would cost approximately $5 billion, but for those with the means, Cerebras can make it happen.

This approach also addresses a major challenge in building trillion-parameter models. OpenAI's GPT-4 project involved 240 contributors, with 35 engineers solely dedicated to solving the distributed computing problem. Cerebras has managed to not only reduce this problem but eliminate it entirely.

Cerebras' software stack offers a unified interface to the AI Supercomputer, regardless of its size. This unified approach provides real business value, allowing models to be quickly deployed with only 5% of the resources required by other AI platforms. This advantage gives Cerebras a significant edge in the market.

In addition to their technological achievements, Cerebras has made progress in building nine supercomputers worldwide. The Galaxy 3 supercomputer, based on the CS-3, is already under construction, and the remaining six are scheduled for completion by the end of 2024.

The WSE-3 introduces new SIMD engines for 8 and 16-bit numerics, as well as new non-linear functions, resulting in twice the performance per core compared to the WSE-2.

From both a hardware and software perspective, the CS-3 is designed for massive scalability, provided there is a demand and sufficient capital investment.

In conclusion, Cerebras stands out as a truly unique alternative to Nvidia. It is not simply a marginally better GPU or a cheaper ASIC; it represents an entirely different approach to distributed computing. While Cerebras has made remarkable progress, challenges still lie ahead. However, with their innovative technology and strategic partnerships, they are well-positioned to overcome these obstacles and continue disrupting the AI training landscape.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660199b20a6fbc5033ee1cdf/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 15:16:13,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.forbes.com/sites/lesliekatz/2024/03/25/heres-proof-that-spiders-pretend-to-be-ants/,Hereâ€™s Fossilized Proof That Spiders Pretend To Be Ants,"In the fascinating world of nature, survival often depends on the ability to outsmart predators. And one creature that has mastered the art of deception is the spider. Specifically, there are spiders that mimic ants to avoid being eaten by other arthropods.

But why ants? Well, ants are known for their aggressive defense mechanisms. They possess strong bites and stinging venom, and they can call in reinforcements from their nestmates. These traits make them unappetizing to predators, such as larger spiders, wasps, and birds. By imitating ants, spiders are more likely to go unnoticed and avoid becoming a meal.

Recently, paleobiologist George Poinar Jr., a professor emeritus in the department of integrative biology at Oregon State University, made an exciting discovery. He described a new species of ant-mimicking spider that was found perfectly preserved in fossilized resin. This unique specimen, found in Medellin, Colombia, offers a rare glimpse into the adaptive behavior of these deceptive spiders.

To understand the significance of this discovery, we need to delve into the world of fossilized resin. When sticky tree resin hardens and fossilizes, it becomes amber or copal. These materials often trap life forms, preserving them for millions of years. Poinar, who is renowned for his expertise in studying amber-preserved insects and other ancient specimens, recognized the value of this fossilized spider.

However, dating the copal block and determining the exact age of the preserved spider was a challenge. The traditional method of age-testing using acetone and a hot needle could have potentially damaged the specimen. Copal can date back up to 3 million years, so while the exact age remains unknown, this finding still provides valuable insights into the behavior of ant-mimicking spiders.

Mimicry is a common survival strategy in nature, with many creatures adapting their appearance to blend into their surroundings. Spiders, with their eight legs and lack of antennae, face a unique challenge in mimicking ants. To achieve this, ant-mimicking spiders reposition their front legs to resemble antennae. But that's not the only change they make.

The body structure of spiders is different from that of ants. Their abdomen and cephalothorax are closely attached, while ants have a narrow segment called the petiole separating these body parts. To closely resemble ants, spiders need to modify various structures in their body. This transformation is not only a result of mutation and adaptation but also involves reasoning and intelligence on the part of the spiders themselves.

Poinar suggests that spiders model their body changes after specific ants in their environment, indicating a level of intelligence and decision-making. This challenges the belief that all insect behaviors are solely instinctual. The ability of these spiders to mimic ants is truly remarkable, but it comes at a cost. Other studies have shown that the modifications required for mimicry can impair the spiders' own hunting abilities.

In conclusion, the discovery of a fossilized ant-mimicking spider provides us with a unique opportunity to study the adaptive behavior of these deceptive creatures. While the exact age of the specimen remains unknown, its significance lies in the insights it offers into the world of mimicry in nature. Ant-mimicking spiders are true masters of disguise, but their skills come with a price. Despite the challenges they face, these spiders have managed to survive and thrive by imitating ants, ensuring their place in the intricate web of life.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6601d75147f6aaf277e73ba1/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=527,297,x0,y132,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 15:28:10,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/03/25/social-media-could-counter-putin-claim-of-kyivs-involvement-in-terrorist-attack/,Social Media Could Counter Putin Claim Of Kyivâ€™s Involvement In Terrorist Attack,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has alleged a link between the recent terrorist attack in Moscow and Ukraine, despite the Islamic State group claiming responsibility for the attack. Putin's narrative has ignored Kyiv's denial of involvement and instead focuses on the failure of his security services. This tactic is reminiscent of a similar strategy used by Putin 25 years ago, when he blamed Chechens for apartment bombings that some believe were staged by the security services. By alleging Ukrainian involvement in the recent attack, Putin is using a ""liar's dividend"" to mix truth with misinformation and create doubt among the Russian population.

The Kremlin controls most radio and TV stations in Russia, where the majority of Russians get their news. While social media could potentially set the record straight, the Kremlin may have to increase its propaganda efforts to counter alternative information. Disinformation campaigns often involve flooding social media with conflicting narratives to confuse and discourage people from seeking the truth. However, flooding may not be as effective in Russia as it is in other authoritarian states with strict internet controls, such as China and Iran.

One of Putin's biggest mistakes was not imposing strict internet controls like China and Iran. The Russian internet is connected to the world, allowing Russians to access foreign social media platforms and engage via apps like Telegram. While Telegram allows some information to come in, it is also used by military bloggers and officials for propaganda purposes. This creates a ""liar's dividend"" where misinformation and propaganda are mixed together. However, this strategy could backfire and raise questions about the rationale for Russia's invasion of Ukraine two years ago.

The Russian government has a history of using social media channels, including Telegram, to shape the narrative in its favor. Telegram channels like the ""War on Fakes"" spread disinformation to counter what they call ""Ukrainian disinformation."" These channels have amassed a significant number of subscribers and play a role in spreading Russian propaganda. However, it is important to question the credibility of these sources and seek factual news from reliable sources.

In conclusion, Putin is using the recent terrorist attack in Moscow to push his narrative of Ukrainian involvement, despite evidence pointing to the Islamic State group. The Kremlin's control over media outlets allows it to shape the narrative in its favor, but social media and foreign platforms still provide avenues for alternative information. While flooding social media with misinformation is a common tactic, it may not be as effective in Russia as in other authoritarian states. The Russian government's use of Telegram and other platforms for propaganda purposes raises questions about the credibility of their information. As consumers of news, it is crucial to seek reliable and factual sources to avoid being influenced by disinformation campaigns.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6601e0acedb5ad5a83d52887/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 16:43:51,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/large-language-models-can-help-home-robots-recover-from-errors-without-human-help/,Large language models can help home robots recover from errors without human help,"Home robots have struggled to gain widespread popularity due to various factors such as pricing, practicality, form factor, and mapping. Even when these issues are addressed, there is still the question of how robots handle inevitable mistakes. This problem also exists on an industrial level, but big companies have the resources to deal with these problems. However, it is unrealistic to expect consumers to learn programming or hire someone to help them every time an issue arises. Luckily, new research from MIT shows that large language models (LLMs) can be a solution to this problem in the robotics space.

A study set to be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) in May focuses on bringing ""common sense"" into the process of correcting mistakes. The researchers at MIT explain that robots are excellent mimics, but unless they are programmed to adjust to every possible obstacle, they struggle to handle unexpected situations. Traditionally, when a robot encounters issues, it will go through pre-programmed options before requiring human intervention. This is especially challenging in unstructured environments like homes, where any changes can affect a robot's ability to function.

The study addresses this problem by leveraging LLMs to eliminate the need for manual labeling and assignment of subactions by the programmer. LLMs can provide instructions for each step of a task in natural language, and the researchers wanted to connect these instructions with a robot's physical actions. By breaking demonstrations into smaller subsets rather than treating them as one continuous action, the system can automatically understand what stage it is in a task and replan and recover on its own.

To demonstrate this approach, the researchers trained a robot to scoop marbles and pour them into a bowl. While this is a simple task for humans, it involves various small tasks for robots. The LLMs are capable of listing and labeling these subtasks. During the demonstrations, the researchers purposely sabotaged the activity by bumping the robot off course and knocking marbles out of its spoon. Instead of starting from scratch, the system self-corrected the small tasks.

""With our method, when the robot is making mistakes, we don't need to ask humans to program or give extra demonstrations of how to recover from failures,"" says Tsun-Hsuan Wang, a graduate student involved in the research.

This method offers a compelling solution to avoid robots losing their way when faced with mistakes. By leveraging LLMs, robots can learn to adapt and recover from errors without needing constant human intervention. This research opens up new possibilities for home robots and provides a promising path towards more capable and autonomous robotic systems.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/CommonSense-01-press_0.jpg?w=900,2024-03-25 20:01:06,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/lucid-motors-1-billion-saudi-arabia-gravity-suv/,Lucid Motors raises another $1 billion from Saudi Arabia as it searches for luxury EV buyers,"Lucid Motors, the luxury electric sedan manufacturer, is set to receive an additional $1 billion investment from its major financial backer, Saudi Arabia. This funding will help offset the high costs associated with the production and sale of its vehicles.

In a regulatory filing on Monday, Lucid announced that Ayar Third Investment, an affiliate of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, has agreed to purchase $1 billion worth of the company's stock. This investment will increase Saudi Arabia's ownership stake to approximately 60%.

This recent funding news follows Lucid's announcement to investors that it plans to manufacture around 9,000 units of its Air electric vehicles this year, a slight increase from the previous year. However, the company faced challenges in finding buyers for its high-priced sedans and had to reduce prices multiple times to stimulate sales. Lucid is also preparing to start production of its electric Gravity SUV by the end of this year.

Interestingly, Lucid's decision to accept further investment from Saudi Arabia comes shortly after CEO Peter Rawlinson expressed caution about relying too heavily on the Kingdom's financial support. Rawlinson emphasized the importance of not assuming there is ""bottomless wealth"" from the Public Investment Fund, acknowledging the need for sustainable growth.

With this new investment, Lucid aims to address its financial constraints and continue its expansion plans. The company incurred a loss of $2.8 billion in 2023 but ended the year with nearly $1.4 billion in cash and equivalents.

Lucid Motors' partnership with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund has been instrumental in its growth. The Kingdom's financial support has enabled Lucid to develop and manufacture advanced electric vehicles, contributing to the global shift towards sustainable transportation.

As the automotive industry transitions towards electric mobility, Lucid Motors is positioning itself as a leader in the luxury electric vehicle market. With the support of Saudi Arabia's investment, the company can further innovate and refine its offerings, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers who seek high-performance and luxurious electric vehicles.

In conclusion, Lucid Motors' recent $1 billion investment from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund will help alleviate the financial challenges associated with producing and selling its luxury electric sedans.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/uk-government-electoral-breach-voter-data-china/,UK blames China for massive breach of voter data,"The U.K. government has recently pointed fingers at China for a cyberattack that occurred in 2021 and compromised the personal information of millions of U.K. voters. Oliver Dowden, the U.K. deputy prime minister, made a statement in Parliament attributing the data breach at the Electoral Commission to hackers working for the Chinese government. Dowden emphasized that the U.K. government will take swift and robust actions to protect the country's interests from any threats posed by the Chinese government. This is the first time the United Kingdom has officially attributed the cyberattack to China since it was first disclosed in 2023.

The Electoral Commission, responsible for maintaining copies of the U.K. register of citizens eligible to vote, revealed that hackers had gained unauthorized access to the names and addresses of an estimated 40 million U.K. citizens. The compromised data includes information of those who were registered to vote between 2014 and 2022, as well as overseas voters. Shockingly, the data breach began as early as 2021 but remained undetected until a year later.

The U.K. National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) stated that it is highly likely that the Chinese hackers exfiltrated emails and data from the electoral register during the cyberattack. The NCSC expressed concerns that the stolen data could be used for large-scale espionage and transnational repression of perceived dissidents and critics in the U.K. However, when asked for specific details regarding the attribution of the data breach, the NCSC declined to point fingers at any particular China-backed threat actor.

In addition to the data breach at the Electoral Commission, Dowden also mentioned a separate attempted cyberattack in 2021. This attack, carried out by a China-backed hacking group, targeted the email accounts of U.K. lawmakers. Fortunately, parliamentary authorities were able to mitigate the attempted breaches before any email accounts were compromised. The NCSC attributed these attempted email hacks to a group of Chinese hackers known as APT31, which has a history of targeting the online accounts of foreign government officials. APT31 is known for utilizing malware that can create backdoors into systems and extract sensitive information. In fact, the Norwegian government previously attributed a 2018 data breach on its systems to APT31.

Although the U.K. government did not disclose the names of the lawmakers whose email accounts were targeted, the NCSC revealed that most of the affected lawmakers have been vocal in calling out the malicious activities of China. However, the Chinese Embassy in the U.K. denied the allegations and stated that China does not support or engage in cyberattacks. The embassy did mention that China will resort to lawful methods to counter cyberattacks.

The NCSC's director of operations, Paul Chichester, condemned the cyberattacks and stated that they are part of a wider pattern of unacceptable behavior from China state-affiliated actors. Chichester emphasized that targeting the democratic system is unacceptable, and the NCSC will continue to expose cyber actors who pose a threat to the institutions and values that underpin society.

Interestingly, on the same day, the Biden administration accused several Chinese hackers of being involved with APT31's efforts to target U.S.-based companies. In 2020, Google security researchers linked APT31 to the targeting of email accounts belonging to the Trump and Biden presidential campaigns. These events further highlight the global concern surrounding cyber espionage and the need for international cooperation to address these threats.

Moreover, leaked documents from Chinese government contractor I-Soon have shed light on how the private contractor aids Chinese authorities in targeting and hacking other governments upon request. These revelations add another layer to the growing concerns about China's cyber activities and the impact they have on global security.

In conclusion, the U.K. government has officially attributed a 2021 cyberattack on the Electoral Commission to hackers working for the Chinese government. This data breach compromised the personal information of millions of U.K. voters, and the stolen data could potentially be used for espionage and repression. The NCSC has also identified a China-backed hacking group, APT31, as being responsible for attempted cyberattacks targeting the email accounts of U.K. lawmakers. These cyberattacks are part of a larger pattern of unacceptable behavior from China state-affiliated actors. The international community, including the Biden administration, is increasingly concerned about China's cyber activities and their impact on global security. It is crucial for countries to work together to address these threats and protect their democratic institutions and values.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/uk-polling-booth-elections-cyberattack.jpg?resize=1200,777",2024-03-25 15:50:23,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/maju-kuruvilla-is-out-as-ceo-of-one-click-checkout-company-bolt/,Maju Kuruvilla is out as CEO of one-click checkout company Bolt,"Bolt, the one-click checkout company, has undergone a leadership change. Maju Kuruvilla, the former CEO, has been replaced by Justin Grooms, Bolt's global head of sales, who has taken on the role of interim CEO. This information was revealed through Grooms' LinkedIn profile. While Kuruvilla confirmed the change on LinkedIn and X, he did not provide further details and simply posted, ""One-Click Checkedout from @bolt! Onwards"" with a rocket emoji. Arjun Sethi, a co-founder of Tribe Capital, a venture firm, commented on Kuruvilla's LinkedIn post, expressing his positive experience working with him.

According to The Information, the Bolt board voted to remove Kuruvilla over the weekend. Kuruvilla, a former executive at Amazon, became CEO in January 2022 after the departure of founder Ryan Breslow.

Grooms has been with Bolt for five years and has held executive positions at companies such as Ultraleap (formerly Leap Motion), Datron World Communications, and Qualcomm, as stated on his LinkedIn profile. Bolt provided limited information about the CEO transition, stating that the departure of Kuruvilla was ""amicable"" but did not offer any further clarification.

Bolt has faced its fair share of challenges. The company's founder, Ryan Breslow, started the company after dropping out of Stanford. Known for his outspoken nature, Breslow attracted attention to the company. In an interview with TechCrunch, Breslow mentioned that Bolt had secured significant deals in the latter half of 2021, surpassing any previous deals in the company's history.

However, Bolt encountered difficulties along the way. The company faced a federal probe regarding potential securities law violations during its 2021 fundraising efforts. During that time, Bolt was seeking a $355 million Series E round, which valued the company at $11 billion. In total, Bolt raised approximately $1 billion in venture-backed funding.

Bolt also experienced several rounds of layoffs, including one in May 2022, where at least 185 employees, or one-third of the workforce, were let go. Additional layoffs occurred in early 2023 and December 2023, affecting 29% of the staff.

In October, Kuruvilla, then CEO, stated that the SEC was no longer investigating Bolt. He also mentioned that the company was focused on achieving profitability and had plans to introduce new features, such as improved merchandise returns and personalized experiences within its universal shopper network. In November, Bolt announced partnerships with retailers, including Saks OFF 5TH, Shinola, Filson, Lafayette 148, and Toys ""R"" Us.

More recently, Bolt signed an agreement with Checkout.com, becoming Checkout.com's exclusive one-click checkout provider, while Checkout.com became Bolt's preferred payment partner.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/elon-musk-x-ccdh-california-lawsuit-dismissed/,A judge just killed Elon Musk's lawsuit against an anti-hate research org,"A federal judge has made a ruling against Elon Musk, dismissing a lawsuit filed by Musk and X against a nonprofit organization called the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH). The lawsuit was brought about by X, who accused CCDH of spreading misleading claims after publishing reports about hate and extremism on the platform. X claimed that they suffered significant financial losses as a result of CCDH's research. Additionally, Musk and X accused CCDH of illegally scraping data and breaking the platform's rules by using a third-party social media monitoring tool called Brandwatch. Musk, who personally directed the lawsuit, referred to CCDH as ""an evil propaganda machine"" in his responses on X.

Last year, CCDH filed a motion to strike X's claims under California's law against Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (SLAPP), which aims to prevent frivolous lawsuits intended to intimidate others. CCDH CEO Imran Ahmed accused Musk, who has a net worth of around $200 billion, of purposely prolonging the legal process to increase the organization's legal costs.

United States District Judge Charles R. Breyer of the Northern District of California has granted CCDH's motion to dismiss the lawsuit, and has denied Musk and X the opportunity to reopen the case. Judge Breyer stated in his ruling that the purpose of X's lawsuit was to punish CCDH for publishing critical reports about X, and possibly to discourage others from engaging in such criticism. He emphasized that the true intention behind the lawsuit was evident.

Following Musk's increased activity on Twitter, CCDH highlighted the rise of hate speech on the platform. They published a report exploring how Musk's decision to unban several highly followed extremists could potentially boost the company's ad revenue. This included the infamous neo-Nazi Andrew Anglin, who created the white supremacist website known as the Daily Stormer.

CCDH, established in 2018, conducts research on hate speech, extremism, and misinformation on major social networks. Their research regularly exposes disturbing content across various platforms, such as reports on eating disorder content on TikTok, climate denial on YouTube, and violent misogynistic threats on Instagram.

CCDH CEO Imran Ahmed expressed his satisfaction with the ruling, stating, ""We create costs for lies and hate."" He believes that the court's decision affirms their fundamental right to conduct research, speak out, advocate, and hold social media companies accountable for their decisions that impact children, democracy, and fundamental human rights and civil liberties.

The legal team representing CCDH included Roberta Kaplan, who had recently achieved a significant victory against former President Donald Trump in the E. Jean Carroll defamation suit. Kaplan commented on the ruling, saying, ""Today's decision proves that even the world's wealthiest man cannot bend the rule of law to his will.""

While CCDH celebrates their victory in California, Musk is pursuing a similar lawsuit against the left-leaning media watchdog Media Matters for America. Unlike the CCDH lawsuit, X is suing Media Matters for America in Texas, where the protections against frivolous lawsuits designed to stifle free speech are not as strong as in California.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/twitter-x-logo-musk-pattern.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-25 20:33:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-favorite-linux-text-editors-and-why-you-should-be-using-one/,My favorite Linux text editors (and why you should be using one),"Linux has a long history of text editors, with emacs and vi being the most famous. However, the concept of a text editor has evolved over time. While they were originally used for configuring Linux or writing code, text editors now have a much broader range of applications. They can be used for note-taking, journaling, and even writing novels. Personally, I've used text editors for short stories and flash fiction, although I haven't written a full-length book with one.

Now, before I proceed, I want to make it clear that this list does not include vi or Emacs. Although these editors are powerful, I find them to be more of a hindrance than a help. They are not suitable for everyday use or for the average user, which is the focus of this article. However, if you need more advanced features or greater flexibility, you can always turn to vi or Emacs for coding, configuring, and administering tasks.

With that in mind, let's explore some of the text editors that are easier to use but still effective.

1. Nano
Nano has been my go-to text editor for decades. It may be basic, but it gets the job done. Nano offers all the features I need without overwhelming me. It allows me to write simple flat text files without any formatting. Some of its features include interactive search-and-replace, undo/redo, syntax coloring, smooth scrolling, auto-indentation, go-to-line-and-column-number, feature toggles, file locking, and internationalization support.

It's important to note that Nano is a terminal application, so it doesn't have a graphical user interface (GUI). To use Nano, you simply open the terminal and enter the command ""nano filename"" (replace ""filename"" with the name of the file you want to edit or create). There are several options you can use, such as --backup (which creates a backup of the previous version of the file), --tabstospaces (which converts typed tabs to spaces), --locking (which locks the file when editing), --smooth (for smooth scrolling), and many more.

Nano is free and comes pre-installed with most Linux distributions.

2. Gedit
Gedit is the default text editor for the GNOME desktop environment. It's a simple yet effective GUI application. Some of its features include tabs, support for internationalized text (UTF-8), syntax highlighting, markdown support, configurable fonts and colors, print support, auto-save, auto backup creation, keyboard shortcuts, theming, full-screen mode, and more.

What I love about Gedit is its simplicity. While I usually default to Nano, I turn to Gedit when I need a GUI. Another reason I keep Gedit around is that Nano needs to be opened from the terminal window, so clicking on a text file link doesn't work as expected. Gedit solves this issue. Additionally, Gedit can be used in fullscreen mode, allowing me to edit a text file without any distractions.

Gedit is free and comes pre-installed with most GNOME-based desktop distributions.

3. COSMIC Text Editor
COSMIC Text Editor will be the default text editor for System76's COSMIC desktop (once it's released). However, it's already showing great progress and promises to be the Gedit equivalent for COSMIC. COSMIC Text Editor will include features such as syntax highlighting, standard keyboard shortcuts, find, spellcheck, project support, revert changes, document statistics, and even Git management support.

I rarely find dark themes preferable, but with COSMIC Text Editor, it just seems fitting. Like Gedit, COSMIC Text Editor is straightforward to use and can handle basic as well as more complex tasks, such as writing code. If you use Pop!_OS, you can install COSMIC Text Editor from the Pop Shop to get a feel for what it will look and feel like.

COSMIC Text Editor will be free and officially available when the COSMIC Desktop OS is released.

4. Kate
Kate is to the KDE Plasma desktop environment what Gedit is to GNOME. The main difference is that Kate offers a few additional features, such as multi-cursor and multi-cursor selection. These features allow you to select and manipulate multiple strings of text simultaneously. Kate also includes project support, syntax highlighting, standard keyboard shortcuts, and plugins. With plugins, you can add features like SQL query support, GDB debugging, one-click project build, and more. Think of Kate as a supercharged version of Gedit that can also handle simple text file creation and editing.

Kate is a powerful and versatile text editor that is free and available for use with the KDE Plasma desktop environment.

In conclusion, text editors have come a long way from the infamous editor wars of the past. They are no longer limited to configuring Linux or writing code. Nowadays, they can be used for a wide range of tasks, from note-taking to writing novels. Whether you prefer a basic terminal-based editor like Nano or a feature-rich GUI editor like Gedit, there is a text editor out there that suits your needs. So go ahead, explore your options, and find the text editor that helps you unleash your creativity.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/feda4ca65eefc13df0e3505780d84330ecd3c713/2024/03/25/d964a97e-9c56-444a-9497-19bc7ca26a56/typingclosegettyimages-1341060766.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/match-board-directors-after-talks-activist-investor-elliott-management/,Match appoints two board directors after talks with activist investor Elliott Management,"Tinder-owner Match Group has recently made some significant moves, including appointing two new members to its board of directors and entering into an agreement with Elliott Management, an activist investor. Laura Jones, the Chief Marketing Officer at Instacart, and Spencer Rascoff, the co-founder of Zillow, will be joining Match Group's board, effective immediately.

According to Match Group, these appointments are a result of a ""constructive dialogue"" with Elliott Management, and the two companies have also entered into an ""information-sharing"" agreement. This news comes after The Wall Street Journal reported a few months ago that Elliott Management had acquired a stake of around $1 billion in Match Group. The report suggested that Elliott was interested in discussing strategies to help Match Group improve its performance, especially considering the decline in paying users due to economic uncertainty.

Marc Steinberg, a partner at Elliott Management, expressed his confidence in Match Group's potential for value creation as the global leader in online dating. He also praised the collaboration with management and the board over the past few months. Steinberg believes that Laura Jones and Spencer Rascoff will bring valuable skills and perspectives to the board, supporting Match Group in its next phase of growth. It's worth noting that Elliott Management has a track record of acquiring stakes in tech companies and driving changes, as seen in their involvement with Crown Castle and Etsy.

In the company's fourth quarter for 2023, Match Group experienced a 5% decrease in the number of total paid users compared to the previous year, with a total of 15.2 million users. The company's growth has slowed down from the peaks it reached during the COVID-19 pandemic, and its stock has declined by 79% from its peak in 2021.

Match Group is the parent company of various popular dating apps, including Tinder, Hinge, Match.com, Meetic, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, and OurTime, among others.

With these recent developments, Match Group is positioning itself to overcome the challenges it faces in the online dating industry. The addition of Laura Jones and Spencer Rascoff to the board brings fresh perspectives and expertise that can contribute to the company's growth. As the world gradually recovers from the pandemic, Match Group will need to adapt its strategies and find innovative ways to attract and retain users. It remains to be seen how these changes will impact the company's performance in the coming months, but there is potential for Match Group to regain its momentum and continue leading the online dating market.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1241790742.jpeg?w=1024,2024-03-25 14:15:04,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/us-sanctions-chinese-cyberespionage-firm-saying-it-hacked-us-energy-industry-2024-03-25/,"US, UK accuse China of cyberespionage that hit millions of people","Introduction:
U.S. and British officials have recently taken action against a cyberespionage campaign originating from China. The hacking group, known as Advanced Persistent Threat 31 (APT31), has allegedly targeted millions of individuals, including lawmakers, academics, journalists, and defense contractors. This article will delve into the details of the charges, sanctions, and accusations made against China, as well as the global impact of this cyberattack.

Cyberespionage Campaign:
APT31, described as an arm of China's Ministry of State Security, has been accused of conducting a decade-long spying operation. The group's targets included White House staffers, U.S. senators, British parliamentarians, and government officials worldwide who criticized Beijing. In addition, defense contractors, dissidents, and various U.S. companies, including those in the steel, energy, and apparel industries, were compromised. Even the spouses of senior U.S. officials and lawmakers fell victim to this cyberespionage campaign.

Objectives of the Hacking Operation:
The primary aim of APT31's global hacking operation was to silence critics of the Chinese regime, infiltrate government institutions, and steal trade secrets. By compromising work accounts, personal emails, online storage, and telephone call records belonging to millions of Americans, APT31 sought to undermine national cybersecurity and target individuals supporting innovation and progress.

Indictment and Sanctions:
U.S. prosecutors have unsealed an indictment against seven of the alleged Chinese hackers, highlighting the confirmed or potential compromise of accounts and records belonging to millions of Americans. Similarly, British officials accused APT31 of hacking British lawmakers critical of China and compromising the data of millions of people in the United Kingdom through a separate cyberattack. In response, both countries have imposed sanctions on Wuhan Xiaoruizhi Science and Technology, a front company associated with the Ministry of State Security, as well as on two Chinese nationals.

China's Response:
Chinese diplomats in Britain and the U.S. have rebuffed the allegations, dismissing them as unfounded and baseless. The Chinese Embassy in London has referred to the charges as ""completely fabricated and malicious slanders."" While tensions surrounding cyberespionage continue to rise between China and the West, it is worth noting that China has also accused Western countries, such as the U.S., of engaging in hacking activities.

Significant Targets:
The indictment reveals several noteworthy targets of APT31's cyberattacks. In 2020, the group targeted staff members working for a U.S. presidential campaign, aligning with Google's report of Chinese hackers sending malicious emails to President Joe Biden's campaign. Another significant attack occurred in 2018 when APT31 hacked an American firm specializing in public opinion research, coinciding with the U.S. midterm elections. Political organizations serve as valuable sources of intelligence for groups like APT31, offering geopolitical insights and vast amounts of data.

Conclusion:
The charges, sanctions, and accusations against China regarding this extensive cyberespionage campaign shed light on the growing tensions between Beijing and Western countries. APT31's targeting of lawmakers, government officials, and defense contractors underscores the significance of cybersecurity in today's world. As the international community grapples with the consequences of these cyberattacks, it is essential to remain vigilant and proactive to safeguard against future threats.",https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IHFHTIV7JVPOLB3CHV7QVOKF2Y.jpg?auth=742f1df1948eb76186277b6763f13d22a308a0a0958c91de752fba6a3efd8202&width=1920&height=1005&smart=true,2024-03-25 15:50:26,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/london-regtech-gss-raises-47m-to-help-banks-screen-for-global-sanctions/,London regtech GSS raises $47M to help banks screen for global sanctions,"Global Screening Services (GSS), a London-based regulatory compliance platform, has recently secured $47 million in funding. GSS specializes in assisting financial institutions in meeting their global sanctions obligations. This funding comes at a time when economic sanctions are on the rise, with the United States imposing trade restrictions and asset blocking against countries like Russia, China, and Iran.

GSS was initially incubated within consulting firm AlixPartner, where its co-founder and CEO, Tom Scampion, previously served as the head of financial crime for Deloitte's EMEA arm. In 2021, GSS became a standalone entity after being spun out from AlixPartner. Last year, the company raised a similar amount of funding from prominent backers, including Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), one of the world's largest banks. In its latest funding round, GSS has secured support from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), along with Cynosure Group and AlixPartner.

Financial institutions often find themselves at the forefront of sanctions enforcement due to their role in overseeing global money flows. However, identifying the parties involved in financial transactions can be a complex task. For instance, in 2019, Standard Chartered faced $1.1 billion in fines from regulators in the UK and the US for inadequate money-laundering controls, including violations of sanctions against countries like Iran. Similarly, BNP Paribas was fined a staggering $8.9 billion in 2014 for processing financial transactions on behalf of countries sanctioned by the US.

As a result, investors have shown a growing interest in regulatory compliance businesses in recent years. Companies like Droit and SteelEye have successfully raised significant funds to support their operations. GSS offers a sanctions-screening platform that helps banks and other financial institutions comply with regulations. Users feed transaction data into GSS's cloud-based platform, which then compares the data against a standardized set of sanctions lists from around the world. GSS also enhances these lists with additional data points, such as dates of birth and International Maritime Organization (IMO) numbers for ships. The platform also incorporates data from local financial transfer systems in sanctioned countries like Russia and China.

Furthermore, GSS provides ""enhanced"" lists for screening, which include companies that are partly owned by individuals, companies, or governments that have been sanctioned by organizations like OFAC, the EU, or the UK.

With the recent infusion of $47 million in funding, GSS is now moving from the development phase to becoming fully operational. The company is preparing to go live with its initial set of customers.

In conclusion, GSS has successfully raised $47 million in funding to support its regulatory compliance platform. The company aims to help financial institutions meet their global sanctions obligations, especially in a time of increased economic sanctions. With its advanced screening platform and enhanced lists, GSS is well-positioned to assist banks and other institutions in complying with regulations and avoiding hefty fines.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1770041999-e1711386339681.jpg?resize=1200,677",2024-03-25 18:36:37,Innovation,Innovation
