These processors are crucial in various practical applications, such as logistics, resource allocation, and drug and material discovery. However, the scalability of these processors is directly influenced by the complexity of their coupling.

A recent study led by Professor Takayuki Kawahara from Tokyo University of Science has made significant progress in developing a scalable processor for annealing. The researchers successfully tested a processor that divides the calculation into multiple LSI chips. This breakthrough was presented at the IEEE 22nd World Symposium on Applied Machine Intelligence and Informatics (SAMI 2024) on January 25, 2024.

Professor Kawahara explains the team's goal, stating, ""We aim to achieve advanced information processing directly at the edge, rather than relying on cloud services or performing preprocessing at the edge for the cloud."" To accomplish this, the researchers utilized a unique processing architecture introduced by Tokyo University of Science in 2020. They were able to create a fully coupled LSI on one chip using 28nm CMOS technology. Furthermore, they developed a scalable method with parallel-operating chips and demonstrated its feasibility using FPGAs in 2022.

The team's efforts resulted in the creation of a scalable annealing processor that incorporates 36 22nm CMOS calculation LSI chips and one control FPGA. This innovative technology allows for the construction of large-scale, fully coupled semiconductor systems based on the Ising model, which represents mathematical models of magnetic systems and contains 4096 spins.

One of the key features of this processor is its ability to perform 8 parallel solution searches through a method called the ""spin thread method."" Additionally, the researchers developed a technique that reduces chip requirements by about half compared to conventional methods. The processor operates at a modest power consumption of 2.9W (1.3W for the core part) and runs at 10MHz. The team confirmed its practicality by testing it on a vertex cover problem with 4096 vertices.

In terms of power performance ratio, the processor outperformed simulating a fully coupled Ising system on a PC with an i7, 3.6GHz processor using annealing emulation by 2,306 times. It also surpassed the core CPU and arithmetic chip by 2,186 times.

The successful machine verification of this processor indicates its potential for enhanced capacity. Professor Kawahara envisions various social implementations of this technology, such as initiating businesses, joint research efforts, and technology transfer. He states, ""In the future, we will develop this technology for a joint research effort targeting an LSI system with the computing power of a 2050-level quantum computer for solving combinatorial optimization problems.""

The ultimate objective is to achieve this level of computing power without the need for air conditioning, large equipment, or cloud infrastructure, utilizing current semiconductor processes. The team aims to achieve 2 million spins by 2030 and explore the creation of new digital industries using this technology.

In conclusion, the researchers have developed a scalable, fully coupled annealing processor that incorporates 4096 spins on a single board with 36 CMOS chips. Key innovations, such as chip reduction and parallel operations for simultaneous solution searches, have played a vital role in this development.
