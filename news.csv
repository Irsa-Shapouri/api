https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-vulnerability-virtual-reality.html,Vulnerability in virtual reality systems identified,"Virtual reality (VR) systems have become increasingly popular, allowing users to immerse themselves in virtual worlds. However, a team of computer scientists at the University of Chicago has uncovered a potential vulnerability in these systems that could pose a significant security threat. They have identified a way for hackers to insert an ""inception layer"" between a user's VR Home Screen and their VR User/Server, potentially enabling them to manipulate and exploit users.

The researchers have detailed their findings in a paper published on the arXiv preprint server. They describe an app that hackers could add to a user's VR headset, which would deceive users into behaving in ways that could compromise their sensitive information. This app would create an inception layer, a term inspired by the movie ""Inception,"" where a character's reality is altered through downloaded information.

The inception layer would act as an intermediary between the user and the virtual world, allowing hackers to record information entered by the user, such as passcodes for virtual ATMs. It could also intercept and modify information, such as altering the amount of money designated for a purchase and redirecting the difference to the hacker's account. Additionally, the inception layer could introduce virtual imagery, such as representations of friends or family, to gain the user's trust and access to their secrets. Essentially, it could monitor and manipulate gestures, voice commands, browsing activity, and social or business interactions.

The researchers emphasize that this app could be downloaded onto a user's VR device if the hacker gains access to their WiFi network or physical device. Once installed, it could operate discreetly without the user's knowledge. To test this possibility, the researchers enlisted 28 volunteers who played a game using a demonstration VR headset. They then downloaded the app onto the devices, simulating a hacking scenario. During this process, a slight flickering occurred, and only 10 of the volunteers noticed it. Among them, only one questioned whether something suspicious was happening.

Upon discovering these vulnerabilities, the research team promptly informed Meta, the company behind the Meta Quest VR system used in their experiment. Meta responded by expressing their intention to investigate the potential vulnerability and address it if confirmed. The researchers also believe that similar vulnerabilities may exist in other VR systems and various types of apps that attempt to insert themselves between users and their VR devices.

It is crucial to address these security concerns to protect users' privacy and prevent potential misuse of VR technology. The researchers' efforts in identifying and highlighting these vulnerabilities serve as a reminder for VR system developers to prioritize security measures and ensure that users' personal information remains secure.

In conclusion, while VR systems offer exciting and immersive experiences, they are not without risks. The newly discovered vulnerability, involving the insertion of an inception layer by hackers, poses a significant threat to users' privacy and security. As technology continues to advance, it is imperative that developers remain vigilant in safeguarding VR systems against potential attacks.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/vulnerability-in-virtu.jpg,2024-03-25 10:20:02,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.zdnet.com/education/professional-development/want-to-be-a-devops-engineer-heres-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/,"Want to be a DevOps engineer? Here's the good, the bad, and the ugly","DevOps engineering has become an in-demand job in today's economy. However, excelling in this role requires a combination of technological expertise and business acumen. Moreover, continuous learning is crucial, as popular approaches quickly become outdated.

The demand for DevOps engineers, who are responsible for automating and collaborating on both cloud and on-premises environments to ensure the continuous development and deployment of software, is high. In the United States, for example, the average salary for a DevOps engineer is estimated to be around $134,000 per year, according to Talent.com.

But being a DevOps engineer is not without its challenges. According to Brad Morgan, a seasoned DevOps engineer, it is essential to have a strong understanding of foundational technologies. One key skill is learning Linux, as it is widely used in modern DevOps roles. Morgan emphasizes the importance of knowing the basics, understanding how Linux works, and being familiar with using the terminal and basic commands.

In addition to Linux, bash scripting is another critical skill for DevOps engineers. Bash scripting, which automates Linux commands, is heavily used in the DevOps world, particularly in building pipelines. Morgan recommends focusing on learning one cloud vendor at a time, such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure, as being a master of one is more valuable than being a jack of all trades.

Becoming a DevOps engineer does not require a formal course of study. According to Morgan, self-learning is the best approach. Constantly learning and challenging oneself is necessary in this field, as the DevOps ecosystem is vast and constantly evolving. Tools and frameworks that were popular yesterday may be replaced by new alternatives, so continuous learning is essential.

""Homebrew Henry,"" another experienced DevOps engineer, echoes the importance of continuous learning. He emphasizes that the DevOps field is constantly evolving, and engineers must be prepared to invest time outside of work to keep up with new developments. The pace of development, along with the introduction of AI tools like ChatGPT, means that DevOps engineering today will not be the same as it was two or three years ago.

Passionate DevOps engineers are often distinguished by their enthusiasm for infrastructure management. Managing infrastructure is a significant part of the job, involving tasks like setting up, configuring, and maintaining cloud infrastructure. This requires dealing with servers, databases, networks, and security on a daily basis. While this aspect of the job may excite some engineers, it may not be fulfilling for those more interested in software engineering and building customer-facing applications.

It is worth noting that transitioning between software engineering and DevOps is possible. Many examples exist of individuals successfully transitioning between the two roles, so individuals should not feel locked into one path.

Finally, it is essential to consider the business side of DevOps. Unrealistic expectations are often placed on DevOps engineers, with management expecting a few engineers to solve all of the company's problems. DevOps is a hot field right now, but it is important to have a realistic understanding of what the role entails and what it can realistically achieve.

In conclusion, becoming a DevOps engineer requires a combination of technological expertise, continuous learning, and a passion for infrastructure management. It is a field that is constantly evolving, and engineers must be prepared to adapt and learn new skills. While there are challenges, DevOps engineering offers exciting opportunities for those willing to invest the time and effort.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/e4d3d8d263eb00323161fcf2566ad35a3fe52282/2024/03/25/1b8b924e-2629-43c2-b416-1b990e262786/gettyimages-1319039490.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-co8322-sustainable-fuel.html,Research lights up process for turning COâ‚‚ into sustainable fuel,"Researchers from the University of Nottingham, University of Birmingham, University of Queensland, and University of Ulm have made a breakthrough discovery in the field of green fuels. By shining sunlight on single atoms of copper deposited on a light-activated material, the researchers have successfully transformed carbon dioxide (CO2) into methanol. This achievement has significant implications for creating sustainable and clean energy sources.

The material used in this process consists of copper anchored on nanocrystalline carbon nitride. The copper atoms are embedded within the nanocrystalline structure, enabling electrons to move from carbon nitride to CO2. This transfer of electrons is a crucial step in converting CO2 into methanol under the influence of solar irradiation. The research, which has been published in the Sustainable Energy & Fuels journal, demonstrates the potential of this method for producing green fuels.

Photocatalysis is the process in which light is shone on a semiconductor material, exciting electrons and allowing them to react with CO2 and water to produce various useful products, including methanol. However, this process has historically faced challenges in terms of efficiency and selectivity. This breakthrough offers a solution to these limitations.

Carbon dioxide is a major contributor to global warming. While it is possible to convert CO2 into useful products, traditional methods rely on hydrogen sourced from fossil fuels. Therefore, it is crucial to develop alternative methods that utilize sustainable solar energy and the abundance of water. By harnessing the power of photo- and electrocatalysis, this research provides a promising avenue for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change.

Dr. Madasamy Thangamuthu, a research fellow at the University of Nottingham's School of Chemistry and co-leader of the research team, emphasized the importance of the photocatalyst's efficiency in absorbing light and separating charge carriers. The team's approach focuses on controlling the material at the nanoscale, utilizing a new form of carbon nitride with crystalline nanoscale domains that facilitate efficient interaction with light and charge separation.

The researchers also developed a process to maximize the functional properties of carbon nitride for photocatalysis. By heating the material to a specific degree of crystallinity and depositing atomic copper using magnetron sputtering, they achieved intimate contact between the semiconductor and metal atoms. The addition of just 1 mg of copper per 1 g of carbon nitride resulted in a quadrupling of efficiency and a change in selectivity from methane to methanol, a valuable green fuel.

Professor Andrei Khlobystov from the University of Nottingham's School of Chemistry highlighted the sustainability of the catalyst materials used in this process. Carbon, nitrogen, and copper are all abundant elements on our planet, making this catalyst environmentally friendly.

This breakthrough represents a significant advancement in the field of CO2 conversion. It provides a pathway for creating highly selective and tunable catalysts, where the desired product can be controlled at the nanoscale. The potential for developing efficient and sustainable methods of converting CO2 into valuable products, such as methanol, brings us one step closer to achieving the net-zero ambition of the UK and combating climate change.

In conclusion, the successful transformation of CO2 into methanol using single atoms of copper deposited on a light-activated material is a groundbreaking achievement in the field of green fuels. This research offers a promising solution to the challenges of photocatalysis, providing a more efficient and selective method for converting CO2 into valuable products. By harnessing the power of solar energy and utilizing sustainable catalyst materials, we can pave the way for a greener and more sustainable future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/research-lights-up-pro.jpg,2024-03-25 20:10:01,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/can-you-hear-me-now-ai-coustics-to-fight-noisy-audio-with-generative-ai/,Can you hear me now? AI-coustics to fight noisy audio with generative AI,"Can you hear me now? AI-coustics to fight noisy audio with generative AI

Noisy audio recordings can be a nightmare for audio engineers. But a German startup called AI-coustics aims to solve this problem using generative AI technology to enhance the clarity of voices in videos. Recently, AI-coustics emerged from stealth with â‚¬1.9 million in funding. According to its co-founder and CEO, Fabian Seipel, the technology goes beyond standard noise suppression and works with any device and speaker.

The core mission of AI-coustics is to make every digital interaction, whether it's a conference call, a consumer device, or a casual social media video, as clear as a professional studio broadcast. Seipel, who is an audio engineer, founded AI-coustics in 2021 with Corvin Jaedicke, a machine learning lecturer at the Technical University of Berlin. The idea for the startup came from their personal experience with poor audio quality in online courses and tutorials.

The market for AI-powered noise-suppressing and voice-enhancing software is already quite robust. AI-coustics' competitors include Insoundz, which uses generative AI to enhance streamed and pre-recorded speech clips, and Veed.io, a video editing suite with tools to remove background noise. However, AI-coustics claims to have a unique approach in developing the AI mechanisms for noise reduction.

The startup uses a model trained on speech samples recorded in its studio in Berlin. People are paid to record these samples, which are then added to a data set to train AI-coustics' noise-reducing model. What sets AI-coustics apart is its unique approach to simulate audio artifacts and problems during the training process. This includes noise, reverberation, compression, band-limited microphones, distortion, and clipping.

While AI-coustics' compensation scheme for creators may raise some concerns, the startup is focusing on recruiting diverse speech sample contributors to combat bias. Diversity and size are key to eliminating bias and making the technology work for all languages, speaker identities, ages, accents, and genders.

To test the effectiveness of AI-coustics' technology, I uploaded three video clips to their platform: an interview with an 18th-century farmer, a car driving demo, and an Israel-Palestine conflict protest. The processed clips had significantly less ambient background noise, and the speakers' voices were clearer.

Seipel envisions AI-coustics' technology being used for real-time speech enhancement as well as recorded speech. It could even be embedded in devices like soundbars, smartphones, and headphones to automatically boost voice clarity. Currently, AI-coustics offers a web app and API for post-processing audio and video recordings, as well as an SDK for integrating the platform into existing workflows, apps, and hardware.

AI-coustics has five enterprise customers and 20,000 users, with a mix of subscriptions, on-demand pricing, and licensing to generate revenue. The company plans to expand its team and improve its speech-enhancing model in the coming months.

In conclusion, AI-coustics is a promising startup that aims to improve audio quality in digital communications using generative AI technology. With its unique approach and focus on diversity, AI-coustics has the potential to make a significant impact in the market.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1009979808.jpg?resize=1200,801",2024-03-25 18:43:01,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/timtreadgold/2024/03/25/us-and-australia-get-cosy-over-critical-metals/,U.S. And Australia Get Cosy Over Critical Metals,"The global race to secure critical metals for innovative technologies and renewable energy is forging closer ties between the U.S. and Australia, while creating a divide with China. Recent deals involving lithium and rare earths highlight this trend, with both metals playing crucial roles in various applications such as battery technology and wind turbines.

Pilbara Minerals, a successful lithium miner in Australia, has expressed interest in strengthening its relationship with the U.S. and taking advantage of the investment incentives available. Despite partnering with a Chinese company for an expansion project, Pilbara Minerals aims to build a lithium conversion plant outside of China and utilize the U.S. Government's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The company's managing director, Dale Henderson, believes that this strategy can succeed and allow them to tap into new battery material markets outside of China.

The plan to establish a joint venture with a Chinese partner while accessing the IRA incentives is still unclear. However, Pilbara Minerals' intention to build a lithium processing plant ""anywhere but China"" demonstrates their determination to expand beyond Chinese markets. This move aligns with their goal of leveraging the benefits of new markets that will grow alongside the subsidies offered by the U.S.

Another significant deal between Australia and the U.S. involves monetizing a unique geological structure abundant in rare earths and other critical minerals. The Export-Import Bank (EXIM), a trade finance arm of the U.S. Government, has provided a $600 million letter-of-interest to Australian Strategic Minerals (ASM) to support the final design and development of the Dubbo project in New South Wales, Australia.

Following this announcement, ASM awarded a contract to Bechtel, a major U.S. engineering and construction firm, to provide ore processing and infrastructure technical services for the Dubbo project. The involvement of a government financing agency and a renowned engineering company solidifies U.S. support for the project, which has spent three decades in evaluation to unlock the profit potential of a complex orebody.

Bechtel will be responsible for handling a range of minerals at Dubbo, including rare earths neodymium and praseodymium, tantalum, niobium, hafnium, and zirconium. The challenge lies in separating these metals and producing materials that meet customers' requirements at a competitive price. The Dubbo project has been a focal point of the Australia-U.S. Taskforce on Critical Minerals, which aims to leverage Australia's geological resources for the benefit of U.S. industry.

Rowena Smith, the CEO of ASM, highlights that the Dubbo project is strategically important globally in the rare earths and critical minerals sector. By successfully navigating the complexities of the project and meeting customer demands, Dubbo is well-positioned to support the joint objectives of Australia and the U.S.

In conclusion, the pursuit of critical metals for advanced technologies and renewable energy sources is bringing the U.S. and Australia closer together. Through partnerships, investments, and government support, both countries are actively seeking alternatives to reliance on Chinese markets. The successful development of lithium and rare earth projects outside of China will not only contribute to the growth of new markets but also enhance global supply chain resilience and technological innovation.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660204347dcbbcbc0ad19587/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 21:27:14,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/25/99-is-not-total-the-worst-places-to-watch-the-solar-eclipse/,99% Is Not Total: The Worst Places To Watch The Solar Eclipse,"Cincinnati and Columbus, Ohio, unfortunately, fall outside the path of totality for the upcoming solar eclipse on April 8. It's crucial to double-check the location of any eclipse-observing event you plan to attend since many organizers either lack the necessary information or simply don't care about providing it.

Over the past few months, I've received numerous emails from marketers promoting eclipse events. However, a significant number of these events fail to explicitly state whether guests will witness a total solar eclipse or not. This lack of transparency can be attributed to either a lack of knowledge or a deliberate attempt to mislead potential customers.

A total solar eclipse offers a breathtaking experience of a few minutes of darkness and the opportunity to see the sun's corona with the naked eye. However, this phenomenon can only be fully appreciated from within the narrow 115-mile wide path of totality that will pass through parts of 15 U.S. states on April 8.

Unfortunately, some event promoters use misleading phrases like ""partial totality"" or ""99% total eclipse"" to advertise events that are actually outside the path. This is misleading because you are either within the path of totality or you're not. The moon's shadow has a distinct boundary, and if you find yourself on the wrong side of it, you will only experience a partial solar eclipse. The last partial solar eclipse visible in North America occurred on October 14, 2021, and before that, on June 10, 2021.

To help you avoid disappointment, here are a few examples of eclipse events and packages that you should steer clear of on April 8, along with alternative locations where you can experience totality:

1. COSI, Columbus, Ohio:
Downtown Columbus is not within the path of totality. Despite recently updating its website to clarify that its COSI's Eclipse Experience will only offer a partial solar eclipse, one may wonder why they are hosting an event at all. There are locations in the northwestern suburbs of Columbus where a total solar eclipse can be observed, making COSI's event redundant and misleading. Instead, consider going to Dublin, which offers 1 minute and 23 seconds of totality, or anywhere along I-71 north of the I-270 interchange on the north side of town, or Marion, where you can experience 3 minutes and 34 seconds of totality, according to Eclipse2024.org.

2. Science Central, Fort Wayne, Indiana:
Although the Science Central museum in Fort Wayne proudly claims to be ""near the path of totality,"" it is not actually within it. With a partial solar eclipse at 99.89%, their programming for the day may answer questions about eclipses, but it fails to address the critical question of why they brought visitors to a location that doesn't offer the full experience. Instead, consider driving 70 miles southeast to Wapakoneta, Neil Armstrong's hometown, where you can witness 3 minutes and 57 seconds of totality. There is an event happening at the Armstrong Air & Space Museum, which makes it an ideal alternative.

3. Total Eclipse Party at Edgewater Sport Park, Cincinnati, Ohio:
Downtown Cincinnati is not within the path of totality, which means that the Total Eclipse Party at Edgewater Sport Park, located 25 miles west of downtown, will not provide a total solar eclipse experience. In fact, it falls short by just one mile. Despite the event's promise of taking place ""under the enchanting backdrop of a total eclipse,"" the reality is that it will only offer a 99.998% partial solar eclipse. While this is interesting, it is not what is being advertised. Instead, consider driving just nine miles northeast to Miami Whitewater Forest, where a free event will allow you to experience a life-changing 1 minute and 14 seconds of totality.

4. The Alamo and River Walk, San Antonio:
San Antonio, like Columbus, will be split by the edge of the path of totality, with only its northwest side experiencing totality. It is essential to avoid the confusing mix of events found on Visit San Antonio's ""Best events for viewing the eclipse in San Antonio"" page, such as the Solar Eclipse at the Alamo, The Moon's Daughters, and the Hyatt Regency San Antonio's ""Solar Eclipse Viewing Party."" None of these locations will provide a total solar eclipse experience. It is best to stay away from the River Walk and the Alamo on April 8. Instead, consider heading to the northwest suburbs of San Antonio, or even better, west into the Hill Country for a better view.

5. Hotel Ithaca, Ithaca, New York:
The Solar Eclipse Package offered by Hotel Ithaca includes two nights' stay and an ""Eclipse Cocktail Party"" from noon until 5 p.m. on April 8. However, guests will be disappointed to learn that they could have traveled just 20 minutes north to experience the awe-inspiring spectacle of a total solar eclipse. The hotel claims to provide a great location for guests to witness the full visual effects of the eclipse, but this is not the case. Instead, all you will see is a ""99% Magnitude"" eclipse, which falls short of the promised experience.

In conclusion, it's crucial to be well-informed and discerning when planning to observe a solar eclipse. Always ensure that the event you choose is within the path of totality to truly experience the awe-inspiring phenomenon. By avoiding events and locations that fall outside the path, you can make the most of this extraordinary celestial event.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6601750b9a60bff58d97df68/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3777,2126,x0,y395,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 19:00:13,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.zdnet.com/article/amazon-knows-you-dont-have-the-ai-skills-for-tomorrow-and-has-a-plan-to-help/,"Amazon knows you don't have the AI skills for tomorrow, and has a plan to help","The Future of Education and AI: A Conversation with Victor Reinoso

When we think of Amazon, we often imagine the convenience of having packages delivered to our doorsteps. However, Amazon's influence goes far beyond that. As one of the most innovative companies in the world, Amazon has made significant investments in infrastructure, supply chain management, IT, and transportation.

What makes Amazon even more interesting is its incorporation of AI and machine learning into its processes long before it became a popular buzzword. They have been at the forefront of AI adoption and are now taking that expertise into classrooms and virtual learning experiences.

We had the privilege of speaking with Victor Reinoso, the global director of education philanthropy at Amazon, about the future of education and AI. Reinoso, who previously served as the deputy mayor of Washington D.C. with oversight of the city's education budget, brings a wealth of experience and passion to the conversation.

We asked Reinoso about the challenges schools face in integrating AI education into their curriculums and how these challenges can be addressed. He highlighted the AI education gap, where teachers are eager to deliver AI content to students but lack the necessary tools and know-how. In fact, a recent survey conducted by Amazon and Access Partnership revealed that 70% of educators lack the resources to teach AI skills.

To bridge this gap, Reinoso emphasized the importance of funding educator training and increasing awareness of and access to tools and curriculum. Amazon is committed to providing free AI skills training to two million people by 2025. They have launched initiatives such as the Hour of Code Dance Party: AI Edition, which introduces coding and generative AI to K-12 students and teachers, and the AWS Generative AI Scholarships, which provide free access to a generative AI course on Udacity for high school and university students.

Reinoso also touched on the responsibility of using AI ethically. Teachers recognize the importance of teaching students how to use AI responsibly, and it is a priority in the AI curriculum. As AI continues to evolve, responsible stewardship will be crucial in guiding its application.

In conclusion, Amazon's commitment to AI education is commendable. By addressing the AI education gap and providing resources and training to educators, they are paving the way for a future where AI skills are accessible to all. With responsible AI use as a core component of the curriculum, the next generation of students will be well-equipped to navigate the AI-driven world.

The integration of AI into education is an exciting development that holds immense potential. As Amazon continues to lead the way in AI innovation, it is clear that the future of education is intertwined with the power of AI.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/08bc5883c45c188259ecb098a51ea114dc119601/2024/03/25/38b15b64-4b2d-45b8-8147-39fda8737c67/amazon-future-engineer-career-discovery-day-20231024-bsd-students-1010.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 10:59:00,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-favorite-linux-text-editors-and-why-you-should-be-using-one/,My favorite Linux text editors (and why you should be using one),"Linux has a long history of text editors, with the infamous editor wars between emacs and vi. However, the role of text editors has evolved over time. While they were once primarily used for configuring Linux or writing code, they now have a much broader range of applications. Text editors are now used for note-taking, journaling, and even writing novels. Although I have not personally used a text editor to write a full-length book, I have found them to be invaluable for crafting short stories and flash fiction.

Before I delve into my list of recommended text editors, I should address the absence of vi and Emacs. While these editors are undeniably powerful, I have always found them to be more of a hindrance than a help. They are not designed for everyday use or for the average user, which is the focus of this article. However, if you find the editors listed here to be too simple or not flexible enough, vi and Emacs are always there to assist you with coding, configuring, and administering.

So, let's jump into the list of text editors that are both easy to use and effective.

1. Nano:
Nano has been my go-to text editor for decades. It may be basic, but it gets the job done. Nano offers all the essential features I need in an editor, without overwhelming me with unnecessary complexity. With Nano, you can write simple flat text files without any formatting. It includes interactive search-and-replace, undo/redo, syntax coloring, smooth scrolling, auto-indentation, go-to-line-and-column-number, feature toggles, file locking, and internationalization support.

It is worth noting that Nano is a terminal application, meaning it lacks a graphical user interface. To use Nano, you simply open the terminal and issue the command ""nano filename"" (where ""filename"" is the name of the file you want to edit or create). There are several options available, such as ""--backup"" (which creates a backup of the previous version of the file), ""--tabstospaces"" (which converts typed tabs to spaces), ""--locking"" (which locks the file when editing), ""--smooth"" (for smooth scrolling), and many more.

Nano is free and comes pre-installed with most Linux distributions.

2. Gedit:
Gedit is the default text editor for the GNOME desktop environment. It is a basic, yet effective, GUI application. Gedit offers features like tabs, support for internationalized text (UTF-8), syntax highlighting, markdown support, configurable fonts and colors, print support, auto-save, auto backup creation, keyboard shortcuts, theming, full-screen mode, and more.

What sells me on Gedit is its simplicity. While I usually default to Nano, when I need a GUI, Gedit is my choice. Another reason I keep Gedit around is that Nano needs to be opened from the terminal window, which makes clicking on a text file link less convenient. Additionally, Gedit provides a fullscreen mode, allowing me to edit text files without any distractions.

Gedit is free and comes pre-installed with most GNOME-based desktop distributions.

3. COSMIC Text Editor:
While COSMIC Text Editor will be the default text editor for System76's COSMIC desktop (once it's released), it is already showing great promise. COSMIC Text Editor aims to be the Gedit equivalent for COSMIC. It offers standard features like syntax highlighting, standard keyboard shortcuts, find and spellcheck capabilities, project support, revert changes, document statistics, and even Git management support.

I find the dark theme of COSMIC Text Editor to be particularly appealing. Like Gedit, COSMIC Text Editor is straightforward to use and can handle both basic and more complex tasks, such as writing code. If you are a user of Pop!_OS, you can get a taste of what COSMIC Text Editor will look and feel like by installing it from the Pop Shop.

COSMIC Text Editor will be available for free when the COSMIC Desktop OS is released.

4. Kate:
Kate is to the KDE Plasma desktop environment what Gedit is to GNOME. The main difference between the two is that Kate offers a few additional features, such as multi-cursor and multi-cursor selection. These features allow you to select and manipulate multiple strings of text simultaneously. Kate also includes project support, syntax highlighting, standard keyboard shortcuts, and plugins. With plugins, you can expand the functionality of Kate to include features like SQL query support, GDB debugging, one-click project build, and more. Think of Kate as a supercharged version of Gedit that can handle both simple text files and more complex tasks.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/bankrupt-ev-startup-arrival-sold-its-assets-to-canoo/,Bankrupt EV startup Arrival sold its assets to Canoo,"Bankrupt electric vehicle (EV) startup Arrival has sold some of its assets, including advanced manufacturing equipment, to struggling startup Canoo. This acquisition is seen as a cost-saving measure for Canoo, which is currently facing challenges in moving from prototypes to commercial production. The purchased assets will be sent to Canoo's facility in Oklahoma, and it remains unclear if Canoo also acquired any of Arrival's intellectual property (IP).

Arrival, once valued at over $13 billion and backed by Hyundai and UPS, announced in January that it intended to sell off assets and IP from its U.K. division after filing for bankruptcy protection. The company had ambitious plans to revolutionize EV production by building compact ""microfactories"" in city centers. However, these plans fell through as Arrival faced financial difficulties and underwent multiple restructurings, resulting in layoffs and a shift in focus to the U.S. market. Arrival never achieved large-scale production of commercial vehicles and is now valued at around $7.7 million.

Similarly, Canoo has faced its own challenges. After going public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, the company struggled to produce its EV, which featured an innovative ""skateboard"" architecture housing the batteries and drivetrain. Canoo has reported over $1 billion in its sales pipeline, largely due to a deal with Walmart to purchase up to 10,000 units. However, the company has experienced difficulties in converting these sales into deliveries. Canoo is currently a pre-revenue company that has had to resort to stock splits and issuing more shares to maintain financial stability.

Both Arrival and Canoo represent the volatile nature of the EV startup market. While Arrival's bankruptcy and asset sale signify its inability to fulfill its initial promises, Canoo's struggles demonstrate the challenges faced in translating sales into successful deliveries. These incidents highlight the importance of financial stability, production capabilities, and market demand for EV startups to thrive in this competitive industry.

Despite their difficulties, both Arrival and Canoo have the potential to contribute to the growth of the EV market. As they navigate their respective challenges, it will be interesting to see how these startups adapt and innovate to achieve commercial success in the future.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/canoo-walmart-arkansas.jpg?resize=1200,670",2024-03-25 22:15:20,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-method-quantum-mechanics-lithium-metal.html,New method that uses quantum mechanics can lead to improved lithium metal batteries,"In a recent study published in Nature Energy, two professors from Texas A&M University, Dr. Perla Balbuena and Dr. Jorge Seminario, have developed a groundbreaking method for understanding the effects of external pressure on lithium-metal batteries. By using quantum mechanics, they aim to improve lithium-metal battery fabrication processes, leading to longer-lasting and more efficient battery technologies.

Dr. Balbuena expressed her enthusiasm for the study, stating that it demonstrates the impact of first-principles ab initio analysis on the design of macroscopic processes. She also noted that similar methods can be applied to other fields such as chemical engineering, electrical, mechanical, materials science, and biology.

The research is part of the ongoing Battery500 Consortium, a collaboration between national labs and academia. The consortium aims to develop more reliable and high-performing vehicle batteries to meet the goals set by the Department of Energy. This collaboration is led by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

Lithium-ion batteries have played a crucial role in revolutionizing mobile electronics. They have enabled the development of nanoelectronics and compact devices that can easily fit in our pockets. However, these batteries still face several challenges, one of which is limited energy density due to their battery components.

Dr. Seminario explains that lithium-ion batteries rely on two essential electrodes to convert lithium ions into neutral species and store their energy as chemical energy. These neutral species are then transformed back into ions, allowing the transport of energy as electrical energy. The anode, or negative electrode, holds the maximum energy of the lithium ions, while the cathode, or positive electrode, holds the minimum energy. This energy difference causes lithium ions to migrate from the anode to the cathode during discharge, energizing external devices.

To overcome the limitations of current lithium-ion batteries, researchers are exploring alternative materials. One promising avenue is replacing the graphite anode with lithium metal, which could potentially increase energy density by a factor of ten. However, lithium metal is highly reactive and requires innovative control measures, such as applying external pressure to the battery.

While external pressure has been found to significantly impact cell performance, there is a lack of research on the relationship between external pressure and the electroplating of lithium in large-format pouch cells. Furthermore, when the battery undergoes cycling, its components may experience volume changes, leading to cell swelling and affecting battery performance and cycle life.

The study by Dr. Balbuena and Dr. Seminario focuses on understanding why pressure can result in a more uniform distribution of lithium ions on the anode, thus preventing the formation of dendrites, which can cause short-circuits in batteries. Using theoretical-computational techniques, the researchers analyzed the effects of pressure on lithium-metal anodes.

By analyzing the trajectories of lithium ions migrating from the cathode to the anode, the researchers found that the ions preferentially detour toward regions with elevated pressure or a higher concentration of lithium atoms on the surface. This behavior is influenced by the electric field generated by the lithium-metal anode.

This groundbreaking discovery allows researchers to predict the behavior of novel materials proposed as components for cutting-edge applications. Understanding ion behavior under these conditions could lead to the widespread use of lithium-metal batteries with lower costs, improved fabrication processes, longer battery life, and increased functionality.

Overall, this study sheds light on the potential of external pressure to enhance lithium-metal batteries and opens up new possibilities for the future of battery technology. The research conducted by Dr. Balbuena and Dr. Seminario highlights the importance of quantum mechanics in advancing battery fabrication processes and improving energy storage technologies. With further advancements, lithium-metal batteries could become the next generation of high-performance batteries, revolutionizing various industries and applications.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/new-discovery-can-lead.jpg,2024-03-25 17:06:08,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/25/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-upgrade-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-s23/,Appleâ€™s Surprise Update Just Made iPhone More Like Android,"Appleâ€™s recent AI news has brought about significant changes for the iPhone, particularly in terms of security and privacy risks. While Apple has always prided itself on being more private and secure than Android, the gap between the two is narrowing as Google strengthens its security measures and Apple makes its own concessions.

A recent report from China confirms that Apple has struck a deal with Baidu, a Chinese company known for its generative AI capabilities. Baiduâ€™s AI model is approved by the Chinese government and has strong ties to the state. Although there were rumors of military AI ties, these were denied. Nonetheless, this development is noteworthy for Apple, which has always prioritized privacy.

In China, the AI landscape is heavily regulated, with only government-approved models allowed. While the focus of these approvals is mainly on censorship and the prevention of dissent, surveillance and control are always part of the context. Apple has been navigating this challenging landscape since its early days in China, and its growth in the country has only exacerbated the situation.

AI presents a difficult path to tread because of its rapid expansion in our lives and smartphones. Granting or denying AI access to sensitive information is an ongoing challenge. Baidu, like other companies operating in China, is subject to national security laws that have been extensively debated in relation to ByteDance/TikTok, Huawei, and others.

Initially, it was speculated that Apple would keep its generative AI plans for iOS 18 on-device, ensuring privacy and security through hardware and software design. This would align with its expanded end-to-end encryption and user controls. However, news broke that Apple was in talks with Google about Gemini, which changed everything.

From a privacy standpoint, Googleâ€™s AI is primarily cloud-based, although it does have Nano for lighter on-device functionality. The idea of Apple considering Google technology for its iPhone surprised many, given the companies' different approaches to AI, cloud, encryption, and privacy. However, there was a logical commercial reason behind it. Google is at the forefront of generative AI and has made significant progress in applying it to smartphones, apps, and services. This partnership also paved the way for an exclusive iPhone search arrangement. Time is of the essence, and Apple needs to keep up.

This convergence between iPhone and Android is not limited to Appleâ€™s potential deal with Google. Samsung, which has its own hybrid approach to AI, also combines cloud-based and on-device AI. Samsung aims to strike a balance between AI features and user privacy and data security, similar to Apple's approach. Interestingly, Samsung also has a combination of Gemini and Baidu, just like Apple.

Samsungâ€™s TM Roh emphasized the need to raise the standards of security and privacy in the era of data-intensive mobile experiences. At the time, I assumed that Apple would prioritize on-device AI over cloud-based AI, with privacy considerations taking center stage. I also noted the balancing act Samsung had to perform with both Googleâ€™s and its own AI. However, I did not expect Apple to find itself in the same position, especially with the added complexity of Chinese generative AI.

It is important to note that Apple has not yet provided any official statements or comments on these developments. However, it is clear that the landscape of AI, privacy, and security is changing rapidly, and Apple must navigate these challenges to maintain its commitment to privacy while embracing the benefits of AI.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65aeed369be3a016e61b4a9a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 23:00:00,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/london-regtech-gss-raises-47m-to-help-banks-screen-for-global-sanctions/,London regtech GSS raises $47M to help banks screen for global sanctions,"Global Screening Services (GSS), a London-based regulatory compliance platform, has successfully raised $47 million in funding. The company specializes in helping financial institutions meet their global sanctions obligations, which has become increasingly important due to the rise in economic sanctions.

Countries like the United States have been issuing trade restrictions and asset blocking against states such as Russia, China, and Iran. As a result, banks and other financial institutions face the challenge of ensuring they are not involved in any transactions that violate these sanctions.

GSS was founded by Tom Scampion, who previously served as the head of financial crime for Deloitte's EMEA arm. In 2020, Scampion left Deloitte to become a general partner at consulting firm AlixPartner. It was during his time at AlixPartner that GSS was incubated before being spun out as an independent company in 2021.

Last year, GSS raised a similar amount of funding from prominent investors, including Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). For its most recent funding round, GSS attracted another major player in the form of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA). Cynosure Group and AlixPartner also participated in this latest round of funding.

The involvement of major financial institutions in funding GSS is a testament to the importance of regulatory compliance in the banking industry. Banks often find themselves at the forefront of sanctions enforcement due to their role in facilitating global financial transactions. However, it can be challenging for banks to identify who is sending money to whom, making the services provided by GSS invaluable.

GSS offers a sanctions-screening platform that enables banks and financial institutions to comply with regulations. Users input transaction data into GSS's cloud-based platform, which then checks the data against a comprehensive set of sanctions lists from around the world. GSS also enhances these lists by adding additional data points, such as dates of birth and International Maritime Organization (IMO) numbers for ships. This additional information helps ensure accurate and thorough screening.

In addition to standard sanctions lists, GSS also provides ""enhanced"" lists that include companies partially owned by sanctioned individuals, companies, or governments. This comprehensive approach to screening helps financial institutions minimize the risk of inadvertently violating sanctions.

With the recent funding round, GSS is now moving from the development phase to full operation. The company is preparing to go live with its first customers, marking an important milestone in its journey.

The success of GSS and similar regulatory compliance businesses reflects the growing demand for solutions in this field. Companies like Droit in New York and SteelEye in London have also attracted significant investments in recent years.

In conclusion, GSS's recent funding round of $47 million demonstrates the importance of regulatory compliance in the banking industry. The company's sanctions-screening platform provides financial institutions with the tools they need to meet their global sanctions obligations. With its enhanced lists and additional data points, GSS ensures thorough and accurate screening. As GSS prepares to launch its services, it is poised to make a significant impact in the field of regulatory compliance.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1770041999-e1711386339681.jpg?resize=1200,677",2024-03-25 18:36:37,Innovation,Innovation

March is coming to an end, and it has been a strange month indeed. Winter has been holding on tightly, not allowing spring to fully bloom. Although today is sunny and the snow is melting, there is more snow in the forecast for Easter weekend. And then, right after Easter, we have April Fool's Day, which happens to be my least favorite day of the year. It's probably best to stay offline and avoid any pranks.

Ironically, it was on April Fool's Day that I managed to guess not just one, but two Wordles correctly. I chose the word ""march"" because if I were to play an April Fool's prank in Wordle style, I would pick a month with five letters that is not a proper noun (April is a proper noun and cannot be an answer in Wordle).

Speaking of proper nouns, yesterday's Wordle really threw me off!

Now, let's get to today's Wordle.

How to Solve Today's Wordle

Hint: Politician
Clue: The last letter of today's Wordle is a consonant.

And now, for the answer...

Wordle Analysis

Every day, I eagerly check Wordle Bot to see how I did. You can check your Wordles with Wordle Bot as well.

I was so confident in my third guess, only to be disappointed when the third box turned grey. Oh well, that's life! My initial guess was close, but not quite there. I had 196 words remaining and only one yellow letter, 'O'. With that in mind, I narrowed down my options and chose ""major"" because it had the letter 'M' in it. Unfortunately, it turned out to be ""mayor"" instead of ""major"" for today's Wordle.

Competitive Wordle Score

I lose 1 point for the Bot solving it in just three guesses (crane/tyros/mayorâ€”tyros? Really?) and get 0 points for guessing in four. Overall, I'm at -1. Sigh.

Today's Wordle Etymology

The word ""mayor"" originates from the Old French word ""maire,"" which means ""head of a city or town government."" This word, in turn, comes from the Latin ""maior,"" meaning ""greater"" or ""superior."" In Latin, ""maior"" was used in the title ""maior domus"" or ""major domo,"" which referred to the ""chief steward"" of a noble house. This title indicated a position of authority and oversight. Over time, ""maior"" transformed into various forms in Romance languages, eventually giving rise to the English word ""mayor."" The role of a mayor as the leader of a city or municipal government reflects the historical sense of being a superior or chief official within a local jurisdiction.
