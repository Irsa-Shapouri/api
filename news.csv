Okay, it’s 2XP Friday folks! That means that any of you playing Competitive Wordle against me or the Wordle Bot can double up on your wins—or your losses—depending on your guessing game today (see rules below).
I get the whole double XP thing from my other daily game: Call Of Duty. It’s a big weekend for us COD fans. The Modern Warfare III beta on PlayStation 4 and 5 kicks off Friday and runs through Tuesday. I’ll be diving into that (between Wordles, of course).
In any case, let’s do this Wordle!
How To Solve Today’s Word
The Hint: Bell.
The Clue: This word ends with a vowel.

Wordle Bot Analysis
After each Wordle I solve I head over to the Wordle Bot homepage to see how my guessing game was.
Can you solve today’s phrase? Play Now
Just like yesterday, I got today’s in two—though it was wildly lucky. Both my first and second guesses were crazy good. I guessed clone because I was thinking about Ahsoka on Disney Plus and how it’s made for Clone Wars and Rebels fans rather than the wider Star Wars fandom. I almost guessed rebel but was worried about using two E’s so I went with clone instead and walked away with a green ‘C’ and a green ‘E’ and three grey boxes inbetween.
Honestly, the first thing I thought of after that was chime. I’m not sure why! I figured it was just as good a guess as any, but I was pretty shocked it was the right answer. It could have been chute or, um, honestly I only can think of a couple without trying harder. Still, I’ll take the W!
Today’s Score
I get 2 points for guessing in two and 1 point for beating the Bot who guessed in three and then I double that for 2XP Friday for a whopping 6 points. HUZZAH FOR ME!!!
Today’s Wordle Etymology
The word ""chime"" has its origins in the Middle English word ""chymbe"" or ""chymbel,"" which were used to refer to musical instruments such as bells or cymbals. These Middle English terms were borrowed from the Old English word ""cymbal,"" which itself came from the Latin word ""cymbalum.""
The Latin ""cymbalum"" referred to a musical instrument, particularly a kind of cymbal. It is believed to have been borrowed from the Greek word ""kymbalon,"" which also referred to a cymbal. The word ""chime"" gradually evolved in English to refer to the sound produced by such musical instruments, particularly the harmonious or melodious sound made by a set of bells when they are struck or ring together.
Over time, ""chime"" also came to be used metaphorically to describe things that harmoniously or melodiously coincide or agree, such as when events or ideas ""chime in"" with each other. Today, ""chime"" is commonly associated with the pleasant and harmonious sound produced by bells or other similar instruments.

Donald Trump endorsed Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio to be the next speaker of the house shortly after midnight E.T. on Friday in a post to Truth Social. The endorsement will likely put to rest any idea that Trump would run for the position himself after Rep. Kevin McCarthy was ousted from the job earlier this week.
“Congressman Jim Jordan has been a STAR long before making his very successful journey to Washington, D.C., representing Ohio’s 4th Congressional District. Respected by all, he is now Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. As President, I had the honor of presenting Jim with our Country’s highest civilian award, The Presidential Medal of Freedom,” Trump wrote on Truth Social in a very long and rambling post.
Trump went on to tout Jordan’s time as in college wrestling and pointed out the representative’s attitudes on guns and the U.S.-Mexico border before giving his explicit endorsement.
“Jim, his wife, Polly, & family are outstanding - He will be a GREAT Speaker of the House, & has my Complete & Total Endorsement!” Trump wrote.
Donald Trump's Truth Social post early Friday morning endorsing Jim Jordan for speaker of the house Truth Social
Rep. McCarthy was kicked out as speaker on Tuesday, lasting just nine months on the job, after rival Republican Matt Gaetz invoked a Motion to Vacate at the U.S. House, insisting McCarthy wasn’t conservative in his negotiations with President Joe Biden and other Democrats.
After McCarthy’s ouster, the House went into recess until next week, when Republican members are expected to convene and hear formal pitches from people who want the job. Until tonight, Jim Jordan and Steve Scalise were considered the two favorites for the position, but there were a number of people who floated the idea of Trump becoming speaker since U.S. House rules don’t state that the speaker must be a member of Congress. Notably, Gaetz nominated Trump to be speaker back in January before McCarthy got the position.
That long-shot attempt to nominate Trump will likely fade away, despite getting endorsements from far-right figures like Marjorie Taylor-Greene of Georgia. Trump himself even shared a doctored image of himself as Speaker of the House as recently as Wednesday on Truth Social, fanning the flames of speculation about whether he really would try to take the role. Fox News was the first to report on Wednesday night that Trump was mulling an endorsement of Jordan.
It’s unclear whether Scalise will even toss his hat in the ring now that Trump—still the perceived yet unofficial leader of the Republican Party—has endorsed Jordan. Scalise is also undergoing treatment for cancer which may or may not play a role in his decision, as many political pundits have pointed out.
One thing we know for sure: Trump is still happy to break news over at Truth Social, a platform that doesn’t have much going on aside from Trump’s own posts. But as long as the former president has a microphone that nobody can turn off, he seems happy to stay there.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/651f8b0fd77ec78f0860ac48/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=4096,2303,x0,y19,safe&width=1200",2023-10-06 00:22:47

Warzone is getting a major overhaul after Modern Warfare III launches. A bunch of changes are coming to Call Of Duty’s massive battle royale game.
Chief among these is a brand new map: Urzikstan.
The new map is just about everything players have been hoping for. It takes the Russian-adjacent setting of Verdansk and plops it into a map about the same size as Caldera.
Instead of big open spaces and tons of elevation changes, Urzikstan is generally more flat and dense, with lots of urban areas to explore and close-combat encounters to engage in.
Here’s the flythrough showcasing some of the new map’s many locations, including Zaravan City—a dense urban area with high-rises—Sorokin Industrial, Popov Power, Shahin Manor, Low Town, Old Town, Orlov Military Base, Urzikstan Cargo and Quadri Shopping Center.
Here’s the map layout:
Warzone Credit: Activision
As you can see, similar to Vondel, this is basically a square mostly populated by buildings, waterways and roads.
It looks terrific, quite frankly. Some of the other changes coming to Warzone include horizontal ziplines, manually equipped gas-masks, individual ammo slots separate from backpack inventory, and movement more in-line with MWIII. Players will also always deploy with pistols that can be used on ladders or underwater, meaning you’ll never be caught at a disadvantage in those situations (or at least not a definitive one).
Weapon rarities (color-coded to indicate better or worse loot) also make a return, as do tactical stims that give players a speed-boost, bringing this closer to what we had with the original Warzone than ever before.
Best of all, two original Warzone maps are also making a return next year. Good news all around when it comes to Warzone, though I’m much less enthusiastic about what we saw for Modern Warfare III during the #CODNext stream.
The Modern Warfare III beta kicks off tomorrow. I’ll be playing and will report back with my impressions. Stay frosty.

[+] the U.S. Southwest. Michael Zeiler/GreatAmericanEclipse.com
When is the next eclipse? On Saturday, October 14 at 16:15 Universal Time—9:15 a.m. PDT—those close to the Oregon Dunes will see a perfect “ring of fire” as the moon covers the center of the sun for 4 minutes 30 seconds.
Over 70 million Americans could see the rare celestial sight, according to NASA.
The first such sight visible in the U.S. since 2012—and the last until 2039—this annular solar eclipse (annulus means ring) will be visible only from within a 125 miles wide path.
Everyone else in North, Central and South America will see a partial solar eclipse. Solar eclipse glasses will need to be worn at all times whether you’re on target to see a “ring of fire” or a partial solar eclipse.

Where Is The ‘Ring Of Fire’ Solar Eclipse?
That path will touch nine U.S. states as it travels southeast across the U.S. Southwest region, exiting the nation at 12:03 p.m. CDT over Padre Island, Texas, where the ring will be visible for up to 4 minutes 52 seconds.
In total over 6.6 million Americans live in the path of the “ring of fire” during the 47 minutes it takes to cross the nation—but many more could see it. “The path of the annular solar eclipse crosses a big swath of the U.S. from Oregon all the way down to Texas, and touches parts of California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico,” said Alex Lockwood, strategic content and integration lead for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, NASA Headquarters, in a press briefing. “They can walk outside and safely, hopefully, view the fun,” said Lockwood. “There’s another 68 million people who live within 200 miles of the path—so over 70 million people could witness this incredible celestial alignment.”
After the U.S. the “ring of fire” will be seen from Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula, Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Colombia and Brazil.

Best Places To See The ‘Ring Of Fire’ Solar Eclipse
You’re not the only one who knows about this rare solar eclipse. If you’re making a plan at this late stage then the best place to watch the eclipse will be anywhere within the path of the “ring of fire” that won’t be frequented by others.
This “ring of fire” is unusual in that it crosses some of the best known and most beautiful U.S. national parks. However, those in the know have long booked out campsites and accommodation in or close to these areas.
At this late stage it’s best to avoid anywhere that’s likely to attract huge numbers of visitors. Honeypot sites are bound to include Crater Lake National Park in Oregon and Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah. A recent announcement confirmed that Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park will be closed, as will Four Corners Navajo Tribal Park and parts of Canyon de Chelly National Monument.
Wherever you plan to go, plan for crowds—and get to your viewing location well in advance of the partial eclipse starting. You can find out the exact time for any location using the “eclipse lookup” option here.

How To Travel Responsibly In Backcountry Areas
Many backcountry areas of Utah, New Mexico, Nevada, Arizona, and Colorado could see significant visitation, which could create pressures on local services and businesses. Be aware that visitors to backcountry locations will have limited facilities and resources. Be prepared to bring everything you need—a full tank of fuel, food, cash, toilet paper, ice—because it may not be available at your intended destination. Also note that in Navajo culture the event is sacred and many Navajo tribal members will not be be working.

Best Cities To See The ‘Ring Of Fire’ Solar Eclipse
Perhaps the best places to consider going to see the “ring of fire” solar eclipse are the three biggest cities each in the three most populous U.S states it crosses—Eugene in Oregon, Albuquerque in New Mexico and San Antonio in Texas. Prices are rising, but a fly-in, fly-out eclipse experience is still possible.
Where Is The Partial Solar Eclipse?
Although you must be within the path of annularity to see the “ring of fire” on October 14, everyone in the Americas will see a partial solar eclipse (those in the path will also see one both before after the “ring of fire”).
How much of the sun will be covered from the moon depends on how close you are to the path of the “ring of fire.” For example, if you are in Denver, Colorado, 400 miles north of the path at Santa Fe, New Mexico, you’ll see 79% partial solar eclipse. In Los Angeles, its 71% since that city is 450 miles south of the path at Cedar City, Utah. However, those in New York, which is about 1,800 miles from the path, the sun will appear to be eclipsed by only 22% by the moon. However, in Austin, Texas just 70 miles from the path a huge 88% eclipse will be seen—but no “ring of fire.”

Hey, folks! Happy Friday. The weather is about to take a drastic turn here, so I think it’s safe to say fall has arrived. It’s the best season, though. I’m looking forward to staying home and playing more games, including my daily dose of Connections.
Today’s Connections hints and answers are coming right up.
How To Play Connections
In Connections, you’re presented with a grid of 16 words. Your task is to arrange them into four groups of four by figuring out the links between them. The groups could be things like horror movie franchises, a type of verb or rappers.
There’s only one solution for each puzzle, and you’ll need to be careful when it comes to words that might fit into more than one category. You can shuffle the words to perhaps help you see links between them.
Each group is color coded. The yellow group is the easiest to figure out, blue and green fall in the middle, and the purple group is typically the hardest one to deduce.
Select four words you think go together and press Submit. If you make a guess and you’re incorrect, you’ll lose a life. If you’re close to having a correct group, you might see a message telling you that you’re one word away from getting it right, but you’ll still need to figure out which one to swap.
If you make four mistakes, it’s game over. Let’s make sure that doesn’t happen with the help of some hints, and, if you’re really struggling, today’s Connections answers.
Connections Hints For October 6
Scroll slowly! Just after the hints for each of today’s Connections groups, I’ll reveal what the groups are without immediately telling you which words go into them.
Today’s 16 words are:
GAGA
HAHA
DECO
HOOK
DADA
NANA
POP
LUCK
DEAD
GOTHIC
MACBETH
LOL
PETER
BIRD
ROFL
WENDY
And the clues for today’s groups are:
Yellow group — conveying mirth in iMessage or a chat app Green group — styles followed by certain artists in a certain time period Blue group — perhaps acquaintances of Smee or Tick-Tock Purple group — [blank] and the Tramp, “[blank] Marmalade” etc
Connections Groups For October 6

This is your final warning!
Today’s connections are...
Yellow group — laughter, in a text (DEAD, HAHA, LOL, ROFL)

Purple group — Lady ____ (BIRD, GAGA, LUCK, MACBETH)
Now I’m cooking. That’s four wins in a row.
I wasn’t 100% sure DEAD would go with the rest of the yellow group, but I took a gamble and it paid off. Then I saw three of the four Peter Pan words and remembered that NANA was the name of the dog.
I destroyed my chances of a perfect game by randomly guessing a group. But then I realized the link between BIRD and GAGA, and that the other two words fit in nicely with those. The green words were my clean-up group today.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulmonckton/2023/10/05/tribute-to-gordon-kelly-superstar-forbes-contributor-and-tech-guru/,"Tribute To Gordon Kelly, Superstar Forbes Contributor And Tech Guru","It is my privilege to honor Senior Forbes contributor Gordon Kelly, who has tragically passed away following a five-month battle with cancer.
During nearly a decade writing for Forbes, Gordon became pivotal to the success of the contributor network. As one of its longest-standing members, he made his influence felt both on the page and behind the scenes while building up an impressive following of loyal readers.
Gordon has consistently penned some of the most popular articles on Forbes.com. His feats include authoring 2,511 articles in sum and accumulating over 174 million page views in just one year, 33 million of which were gained within a single month. So popular was his writing that the site would, on occasion, find itself pushed to the limit in keeping up with the traffic he generated—a fact of which he was rightly most proud.
The contributor network launched in 2010. “Although Gordon wasn’t among the first in, he quickly became a leader,” says Executive Editor Caroline Howard. “He was singular in his creativity, work ethic, digital prowess and ability to hone a specialized beat mostly focused on Apple updates and insider stories. He thoroughly embraced the Forbes ethos of entrepreneurship and generosity—he built what you could call his own newsroom and welcomed and trained a new generation of other contributors. Gordon’s passion was clear every time I spoke with him and I believe those who knew him or read his work know exactly what I’m talking about.”
Still, the body of work he leaves behind encompasses much more than this.
Gordon began his career back in 2001 as a reporter for the UK-based Computer Reseller News magazine, where he received industry recognition as one of the UK’s top four most influential IT journalists. He then went on to set up and run the news section at TrustedReviews.com before joining Forbes as a contributor just under ten years ago in December 2013.
Beyond Forbes, his impact on the world of technology journalism is not to be underestimated. In addition to becoming a highly successful journalist in his own right, Gordon served as a trusted mentor and friend to many others in the technology space, myself included, offering valuable help and advice to several of the writers whose work you will continue to read today here at Forbes and elsewhere.
Gordon will be remembered for his brilliant, fierce, witty, and often very lengthy conversation, while those who met him in person will have his broad grin imprinted permanently on their minds.
During his career, Gordon branched out into successful freelance media training and consultancy projects, including hosting an on-stage discussion between heads of state in Finland, the country that was to become his second home.
In May 2023, Gordon was diagnosed with a rare form of non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, a cancer he fought with unshakable optimism and one he had all but beaten by the end of September.
Undeterred, Gordon continued to write and mentor during this tough time, hiding his condition from all but his closest friends and family until, during the final phase of his treatment, he unexpectedly contracted a chest infection that would prove too much for his weakened immune system to fend off.
Gordon passed away peacefully shortly after midnight on October 1 at the age of just 46.
Forbes won’t be the same without Gordon, and his loss will surely be felt throughout the wider technology industry.
In 2016, I photographed Gordon's wedding and, just over two weeks ago, I was lucky enough to have Gordon serve as best man at my own. Although unable to attend in person, he was still expected at that time to make a full recovery. His passing has come as a shock to us all.
Beloved husband and father of two, Gordon is survived by his wife of seven years, Eeva and his two daughters, Asta, aged five and their two-year-old, Alma. My condolences go out to his family and to all who loved him.

The power of silence is one of the most profound paradoxes that exists in the world of relationships. In our quest for constant communication and endless chatter, we forget that silence can be just as powerful a tool for connection as words.
Awkward silences are often misunderstood and unfairly criticized. In reality, they are not only perfectly normal but can also be a sign of a healthy relationship. Embracing these moments and learning to turn them into comfortable silences can bring you closer to your partner. When seen in this light, you may start viewing awkward silences as a right of passage rather than untimely speedbumps, as they:
Provide an opportunity for intentionality. According to a study published in the Journal of Applied Psychology, silence creates value in a relationship by providing space for more thoughtful and intentional responses. Rather than rushing to fill the void, we can take a moment to consider what we want to say next.

When you stop filling every moment with words, you create space for vulnerability. Sharing silence can be a way to convey trust, showing your partner that you are comfortable enough to be real without constantly seeking approval or validation.

Sharing silence can be a way to convey trust, showing your partner that you are comfortable enough to be real without constantly seeking approval or validation. Build emotional intimacy. Meaningful connections are built on emotional intimacy and silence can be a powerful tool to nurture it. When you sit together in silence, you create a safe and comfortable environment where both you and your partner can simply be. This creates a sense of togetherness that words alone cannot achieve.
Findings from a 2020 study indicate that silence can be an effective and valuable communication tool by itself. The key lies in knowing how to employ it appropriately. Here are three ways to turn awkward moments into comfortable silences.
1. Practice Relationship Mindfulness
A study defines silence as more than just the absence of communication. It’s seen as a deeper quality of presence and active listening. This silence allows for a deep human connection, helping love to emerge through emotions, mental imagery and sensory experiences, culminating in a therapeutic experience.
Rather than avoiding or feeling uneasy about awkward silences, approach them mindfully. Fully engage in the moment, observing your partner’s non-verbal cues like body language and facial expressions, as well as the overall atmosphere around you.
You can keep a small notebook or sketchbook handy for these moments. Instead of rushing to speak, use this time to write a brief note or create a simple sketch that captures your emotions or thoughts in that particular moment. You can choose to share these with your partner later, offering a creative way to express yourself and strengthen your connection. This also adds spontaneity to your relationship and promotes meaningful non-verbal communication, creating a space for deeper connection beyond words.
2. Use Touch To Communicate
Physical touch can be a subtle and powerful way to break the ice during awkward silences. A 2023 study revealed that frequent affectionate touch strengthens love between partners. Holding hands, for instance, is a simple yet deeply meaningful gesture that communicates “I’m here with you, and we’re in this together,” without the need for words.
Similarly, a gentle touch on your partner’s shoulder or a warm hug conveys empathy and support when words fall short. It’s a non-verbal way of letting them know that you’re attentive to their feelings and that you’re there for them to lean on.
In essence, affectionate touch allows you and your partner to build intimacy in a way that transcends conversation and verbalization.
3. Silent Companionship
Silent companionship is a way to enjoy each other’s presence without the need for constant conversation. You can read books, work on personal projects or simply sit together in companionable peace.
Alternatively, watching a sunset, stargazing or taking a leisurely walk hand in hand—these quiet moments can become cherished memories. They offer opportunities for reflection and appreciation of the world around you.
In essence, embracing silent companionship allows you to relish the simplicity of being together. These quiet times enrich your connection, strengthening it over time.
Conclusion
Silence should not be feared or overlooked in our relationships. In fact, when harnessed well, it can unlock new dimensions of trust and comfort. So the next time you and your partner are stuck talking in circles, give silence and stillness a shot—you’d be surprised by how much you are able to communicate through the quiet.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/651de0667039b9be88f2be58/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2841,1333,x0,y427,safe&width=1200",2023-10-05 17:35:16

Now the iPhones are out, attention is turning to what else might launch from Apple this year, if anything. Most likely, Apple has an iPad or two up its sleeve, and will reveal them later this month. Here’s what we know so far.
While there has been plenty of downplaying the iPad, with pundits like Mark Gurman saying there may be no release at all in 2023, which I always found a little unlikely. For years now, Apple has unveiled at least two new iPads each fall, in readiness for the holidays.
Now, though, a report has reached the ears of 9to5Mac from its sources which suggests there could be several tablets ready to drop.
iPad mini
First, there’s the prospect of a new iPad mini, which would be the seventh-generation model. The report claims the design would be the same as the current sixth-gen iPad mini. No kidding! First of all, that design only arrived for the mini on the last version and Apple keeps its designs for more than one generation. Second, if there’s a whole new design coming, you can bet it’ll be on the iPad Pro first and other iPads after.
Apple iPad mini with Apple Pencil. Is a new iPad mini coming soon? David Phelan
My Take
While it’s possible there’s another mini, it seems a bit soon. Popular though the iPad mini is, it’s only two years since the most recent version and the mini tends to be refreshed less often than that.
iPad 11th Generation
Currently, the regular iPad exists in two versions, the ninth- and tenth-generation models. The tenth-gen was announced this time last year and since this tablet regularly has annual updates, a new one seems likely. The ninth-gen model is the only one with Touch ID on the front face, and the only Lightning iPad. A new iPad would keep the design of the tenth-gen model, it’s suggested, but have a faster processor.
iPad 10th generation. Is the 11th-gen model just weeks away? David Phelan
My Take
It’s quite an exciting year for the iPad. I think we may see the ninth-gen model phased out and the tenth-generation vanish with it or drop in price to become the most affordable model.
Either way, the 11th-generation iPad will likely have a faster processor as the only major difference.
iPad Air
According to 9to5Mac, there could be two iPads Air on their way. Which is the most exciting prospect of all, because it could mean that Apple will do for the iPad Air what it’s just done for the MacBook Air, that is, release it in a larger screen size.
The report comments that the second version could be a similar size to the current one but with better specs. This makes no sense to me. But an iPad Air with, say, a 12.7-inch display, well that could be brilliant.
iPad Air from 2021. New version incoming? David Phelan
My Take
The 15-inch MacBook Air has redefined the super-thin, super-light laptop category. A bigger iPad Air could do the same for tablets.
iPad Pro
A new Pro is predicted, but it’s not known if it’ll land this year or next.
My Take
Take it from me, it’ll be 2024.
Release Date
I think that Apple will release the new iPads later in October, perhaps in the last week of the month. I don’t think there’ll be a big event as there was for the iPhone, but I think there’ll be an announcement and a recorded keynote on around Tuesday, October 24, or Wednesday, October 25. Onsale date will likely be Friday, November 3.
And the products will be: iPad 11th generation and one, or, if we’re really lucky, two iPad Air models.
Well, there’s not long until we know for sure.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/651f1f969929ffa3e33560b8/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=1200,2023-10-05 17:00:32

In a surprise announcement during today’s #CODNext livestream, Activision announced the return of two fan-favorite maps to Warzone.
The livestream primarily focused on Modern Warfare III gameplay (which I have some concerns about) as well as Zombies and a brand-new Warzone map which looks excellent.
It was also revealed that both Rebirth Island and Fortune’s Keep would make their way to Warzone in 2024. The original Rebirth Island was actually a Blackout map, which Treyarch introduced alongside the frenetic, fast-paced Resurgence mode back in the Black Ops IIII days. (I miss Blackout!)
Learn everything you need to know about the upcoming Modern Warfare III beta right here.
It was reborn (heh) in Warzone and then followed up with the larger, but still fantastic, Fortune’s Keep not long before Activision shut Warzone down and replaced it with Warzone 2.0 (which is now just Warzone again).
Since then we’ve seen Ashika Island—a decent but flawed Resurgence map—and the excellent Vondel map added. In 2024, these maps will expand to four total. Hopefully we’ll get Resurgence mini mode on the big map, Urzikstan, as well.
We don’t know when the maps will return and won’t have new info until 2024, but this is good news. It’s not surprising news, however. The addition of a cycling Resurgence map-timer signaled that more maps were on the way, and I suspected remasters of both Rebirth Island and Fortune’s Keep would arrive sooner than later.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

Picture a smartphone clad in a casing that's not just for protection but also doubles as a reservoir of electricity, or an electric car where the doors and floorboard store energy to propel it forward. Such technologies may one day be a reality, thanks to recent work by engineers at the University of California San Diego.
The researchers have developed what's called a structural supercapacitor—a device that provides both structural support and energy storage capabilities. Such a device could add more power to electronic gadgets and vehicles without adding extra weight, allowing them to last longer on a single charge.
While the concept of structural supercapacitors is not entirely new, it has been a longstanding challenge to create a single device that excels at both bearing mechanical loads and storing electrical energy efficiently. Traditional supercapacitors are great at energy storage but lack the mechanical strength to serve as structural components. On the flip side, structural materials can provide support but fall short when it comes to energy storage.
Now, a team led by Tse Nga (Tina) Ng in collaboration with Xinyu Zhang, both professors of electrical and computer engineering at UC San Diego, has achieved the best of both worlds in a new structural supercapacitor, reported recently in Science Advances.
As a proof of concept, the researchers used their structural supercapacitor to build a miniature solar-powered boat. The supercapacitor was molded to form the boat's hull and then fitted with a small motor and circuit. The circuit was connected to a solar cell. When exposed to sunlight, the solar cell charges the supercapacitor, which in turn powers the boat's motor. In tests, the boat was able to cruise across the water, demonstrating the efficacy of this innovative energy storage solution.
The device consists of the standard supercapacitor components: a pair of electrode surfaces separated by an electrolyte, which facilitates the flow of ions between the electrodes. What sets this device apart is the combination of materials selected to boost both mechanical strength and electrochemical performance. Credit: University of California - San Diego
The electrodes are made from carbon fibers woven into a fabric. This carbon fiber fabric itself provides substantial structural strength. Moreover, it is coated with a special mixture composed of a conductive polymer and reduced graphene oxide, which significantly enhances ion flow and energy storage capacity.
The solid electrolyte, another critical component, is a blend of epoxy resin and a conductive polymer called polyethylene oxide. The epoxy resin offers structural support, while the incorporation of polyethylene oxide fosters ion mobility by creating a network of pores throughout the electrolyte.
A key design feature here is that the concentration of polyethylene oxide varies across the electrolyte, creating what are known as concentration gradients. Areas adjacent to the electrodes feature a higher concentration of polyethylene oxide. This configuration helps ions flow faster and more freely at the electrode-electrolyte interface, boosting electrochemical performance.
However, a higher polyethylene oxide concentration results in more pores, weakening the material. To strike a balance, the central region of the electrolyte is made with a lower polyethylene oxide concentration, ensuring it can provide structural support while maintaining an efficient flow of ions.
""This gradient configuration is the trick to achieving optimal performance in the electrolyte,"" said Ng. ""Instead of using a single electrolyte configuration, we structured it so that the edges that contact the electrodes have higher electrical performance while the middle is mechanically stronger.""
While this represents a significant advancement toward structural energy storage, the researchers note that there is still much work to be done. Supercapacitors in general have high power density, meaning they can deliver big bursts of energy quickly, but they typically have lower energy density compared to batteries.
""Our future work will focus on increasing the energy density of our supercapacitor and making it comparable to some battery packs,"" said study first author Lulu Yao, a materials science and engineering Ph.D. student in Ng's lab. ""The ultimate goal would be to achieve both higher energy density and power density.""

Researchers from the University of Jyväskylä were able to simplify the most popular technique of artificial intelligence, deep learning, using 18th-century mathematics. They also found that classical training algorithms that date back 50 years work better than the more recently popular techniques. Their simpler approach advances green IT and is easier to use and understand.
The recent success of artificial intelligence is significantly based on the use of one core technique: deep learning. Deep learning refers to artificial intelligence techniques where networks with a large number of data processing layers are trained using massive datasets and a substantial amount of computational resources.
Deep learning enables computers to perform complex tasks such as analyzing and generating images and music, playing digitized games and, most recently in connection with ChatGPT and other generative AI techniques, acting as a natural language conversational agent that provides high-quality summaries of existing knowledge.
Six years ago, Professor Tommi Kärkkäinen and Doctoral researcher Jan Hänninen conducted preliminary studies on data reduction. The results were surprising: If one combines simple network structures in a novel way then depth is not needed. Similar or even better results can be obtained with shallow models.
""The use of deep learning techniques is a complex and error-prone endeavor, and the resulting models are difficult to maintain and interpret,"" says Kärkkäinen. ""Our new model in its shallow form is more expressive and can reliably reduce large datasets while maintaining all the necessary information in them.""
The structure of the new AI technique dates back to 18th-century mathematics. Kärkkäinen and Hänninen also found that the traditional optimization methods from the 1970s work better in preparing their model compared to the 21st-century techniques used in deep learning.
""Our results ensure that the use of neural networks in various applications is easier and more reliable than before,"" suggests Hänninen. The study is published in the journal Neurocomputing.
Simpler models lead to greener and more ethical AI
Artificial intelligence has an increasingly significant role in modern technologies and, therefore, it is more and more important to understand how AI does what it does.
""The more transparent and simpler AI is, the easier it is to consider its ethical use,"" says Kärkkäinen. ""For instance, in medical applications deep learning techniques are so complex that their straightforward use can jeopardize patient safety due to unexpected, hidden behavior.""
The researchers note that simpler models can help develop green IT and are more environmentally friendly because they save computational resources and use significantly less energy.
The results, which challenge the common beliefs and currently popular perceptions with deep learning techniques, were difficult to get published.
""Deep learning has such a prominent role in research, development, and the AI business that, even if science always progresses and reflects the latest evidence, the community itself may have resistance to change.""
""We are very interested to see how these results will be received in the scientific and business community,"" says Kärkkäinen. ""Our new AI has a range of applications in our own research, from nanotechnology for better materials in the sustainable economy to improving digital learning environments and increasing the reliability and transparency of medical and well-being technology.""

Researchers from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) have successfully applied reinforcement learning to a video game problem. The research team created a new complicated movement design software based on an approach that has proven effective in board games like Chess and Go. In a single testing, the movements from the new approach appeared to be superior to those of top human players.
These findings could possibly impact robotics and automation, ushering in a new era of movement design. The team's article in Advanced Intelligence Systems is titled ""A Phase-Change Memristive Reinforcement Learning for Rapidly Outperforming Champion Street Fighter Players.""
""Our findings demonstrate that reinforcement learning can do more than just master simple board games. The program excelled in creating more complex movements when trained to address long-standing challenges in movement science,"" said principal investigator Desmond Loke, Associate Professor, SUTD.
""If this method is applied to the right research problems,"" he says, ""it could accelerate progress in a variety of scientific fields.""
The study marks a watershed moment in the use of artificial intelligence to advance movement science studies. The possible applications are numerous, ranging from the development of more autonomous automobiles to new collaborative robots and aerial drones.
Reinforcement learning is a kind of machine learning in which a computer program learns to make decisions by experimenting with various actions and getting feedback. For example, the algorithm can learn to play chess by testing millions of possible moves that result in success or defeat on the board. The program is intended to help algorithms learn from their experiences and improve their decision-making skills over time.
The research team provided the computer with millions of initial motions to create a reinforcement learning program for movement design. The program then made several tries at improving each move randomly towards a specific objective. The computer tweaks character movement or adjusts its strategy until it learns how to make moves that overcome the built-in AI.

Associate Prof Loke added ""Our approach is unique because we use reinforcement learning to solve the problem of creating movements that outperforms those of top human players. This was simply not possible using prior approaches, and it has the potential to transform the types of moves we can create.""
As part of their research, the scientists create motions to compete with various in-built AIs. They confirmed that the moves could overcome different in-built AI opponents.
""Not only is this approach effective, but it is also energy efficient."" The phase-change memory-based system, for example, was able to make motions with a hardware energy consumption of about 26 fJ, which is 141 times less than that of existing GPU systems. ""Its potential for making ultra-low-hardware-energy movements has yet to be fully explored,"" stated Associate Prof Loke.
The team focused on creating new motions capable of defeating top human players in a short amount of time. This required the use of decay-based algorithms to create the motions.
Algorithm testing revealed that new AI-designed motions were effective. The researchers noted numerous good qualities as a measure of how successful the design system had become, such as reasonable game etiquette, management of inaccurate information, ability to attain specific game states, and the short times used to defeat opponents.
In other words, the program exhibited exceptional physical and mental qualities. This is referred to as effective movement design. For example, motions were more successful at overcoming opponents because the decayed-based technique used for training neural networks takes fewer training steps than conventional decay methods.
The researchers envision a future in which this strategy will allow them and others to build movements, skills, and other actions that were not before possible.
""The more effective the technology becomes, the more potential applications it opens up, including the continued progression of competitive tasks that computers can facilitate for the best players, such as in Poker, Starcraft, and Jeopardy,"" Associate Prof Loke said. ""We may also see high-level realistic competition for training professional players, discovering new tactics, and making video games more interesting.""

Illustration of the solar-powered coupled photoelectrochemical and hydrogenation unit. The coupled device uses sunlight to generate hydrogen and consumes some of the generated hydrogen in situ to hydrogenate biomass-derived feedstock using a homogeneous catalyst. The remaining hydrogen can then be used for energy storage, transport, building and industrial applications. The hydrogenated products are valuable chemicals in high demand by the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. The fraction of the hydrogen used for the hydrogenation reaction can be adapted to demand by regulating the supply of biomass feedstock and the catalyst concentrations accordingly. By switching between ""Feedstock A + Catalyst A"" and ""Feedstock B + Catalyst B"", different hydrogenation products can be produced in the same PEC plant.

It already works: there are several approaches to using solar energy to split water and produce hydrogen. Unfortunately, this ""green"" hydrogen has so far been more expensive than ""gray"" hydrogen from natural gas.
A study by the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) and the Technical University of Berlin now shows how green hydrogen from sunlight can become profitable: part of the hydrogen is used to upgrade raw biomass-derived chemicals into high-value chemicals for industry. This co-production concept is very flexible; the same plant can be used to produce different by-products as required.
We need to move away from fossil fuels as soon as possible in order to limit global warming. In the energy system of the future, green hydrogen will therefore play an important role in energy storage and as a renewable feedstock for the production of chemicals and materials for a wide range of applications.
At present, hydrogen is mainly produced from fossil natural gas (gray hydrogen). Green hydrogen, on the other hand, is produced via electrolysis of water using renewable energy. One promising approach is to use photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices to produce hydrogen using solar energy. However, hydrogen from PEC plants is much more expensive than hydrogen from (fossil) methane.
Full control over reactions
A team led by Fatwa Abdi (at HZB until mid-2023, now at City University in Hong Kong) and Reinhard Schomäcker (UniSysCat, TU Berlin) has now investigated how the balance changes when some of the hydrogen produced in a PEC device reacts with itaconic acid (IA) to form methylsuccinic acid (MSA), all within the same device.
The starting material, itaconic acid, comes from biomass and is fed in. Methylsuccinic acid is a high priced compound and needed by the chemical and pharmaceutical industries.
In the study, the team describes how to control the chemical reactions in the PEC device by varying the process parameters and the concentration of the homogenous rhodium-based catalyst, which is water-soluble and already active at room temperature. In this way, different proportions of hydrogen could be used for the hydrogenation of itaconic acid, selectively increasing or decreasing the production of methylsuccinic acid.
Plant becomes profitable from 11 percent hydrogen for MSA
With a realistic overall PEC plant efficiency of 10 percent and taking into account primary costs as well as operation, maintenance and decommissioning, pure hydrogen production remains too expensive compared to production from fossil gas. This is true even if the lifetime of the PEC plant is assumed to be 40 years.
This balance changes if the PEC reaction is coupled with the hydrogenation process. Even if only 11 percent of the hydrogen produced is converted to MSA, the cost of hydrogen drops to 1.5 € per kilogram, which is already at the same level as for hydrogen from methane steam reforming. And this is true even for a PEC plant lifetime of only 5 years.
As the market price of MSA is significantly higher than that of hydrogen, more MSA increases the profitability. In the experiment, between 11 and up to 60 percent of the hydrogen could be selectively used to produce MSA.
In addition, a previous study has shown that co-production of MSA also reduces the so-called energy payback time, i.e. the time it takes for the plant to recover the energy that its production has consumed.
The PEC plant can also be used to produce other co-products by simply changing the feedstock and the (soluble) catalyst: for example, acetone could be hydrogenated to isopropanol. ""This is another major advantage of our concept of co-production. We have found a promising way to make solar hydrogen production economically viable,"" says Fatwa Abdi.

Researchers fabricated 20mm length waveguides made of the superconducting metal niobium (right).

Credit: Taku Nakajima
A team of researchers has made a breakthrough discovery in the world of Beyond 5G/6G (B5G/6G) signal transmission. Taku Nakajima and Kazuji Suzuki of Nagoya University in Japan, along with their collaborators, created a waveguide made of niobium that speeds up the transition of B5G/6G signals. The researchers published their findings in the Journal of Physics: Conference Series.
The frequency of data waves has continued to increase as B5G/6G technologies have been introduced. Although the currently used metal transmission lines can handle B5G/6G, research has focused on superconducting metals, such as niobium, that have lower transmission loss and can handle higher frequencies.
Nakajima and his collaborators evaluated the use of niobium in a waveguide, a three-dimensional transmission line consisting of a metal tube that guides and confines waves along a specific path, minimizing losses due to radiation and absorption. However, working with the metal proved to be difficult as it was susceptible to deformation and damage during fabrication and handling.
""Fabricating a physical model of a waveguide was very difficult. At first, it was not possible to process it with any precision at all,"" Nakajima said. The result of their first cutting caused a milling burr, an unwanted projection of the metal. ""We tried to search for the best cutting tool and cutting parameters and eventually found that diamond-like carbon-coated tools were the best. This trial-and-error process took several months.""
Using their method, the researchers fabricated rectangular waveguides that can transmit radio waves in the 100 GHz band that are necessary for B5G/6G communications. They compared the conductivity of their niobium waveguide with that of common non-superconducting waveguide materials: a gold-plated tellurium copper and aluminum alloy.
They tested both at room temperature and at low temperatures because the characteristics of superconducting metals change with cooling, entering what is called the superconducting state, which is characterized by low electrical resistance.
""As expected, we found that the conductivity improves as the temperature of the metal decreases, resulting in reduced losses in the circuit,"" said Nakajima.
""Using electromagnetic field simulations, we calculated the conductivity and transmission loss of each metal. The conductivity of niobium in the superconducting state was 1,000 to 10,000 times higher than that of the aluminum alloy. Furthermore, the transmission loss of niobium in the superconducting state was calculated to be several tenths that of other metals. These two factors contribute to the creation of a high-quality, high-precision communication environment.""
The results of this study have important implications for uses of their technology for B5G/6G communications. According to Nakajima, ""By applying the results of this research, an unprecedented ultra-sensitive receiving system can be realized in radio telescope receivers for astronomical observations, where waveguide circuits are already widely used, and in environmental measurement equipment for the earth's atmosphere.""
""This will open up new fields of scientific observation using high-frequency radio waves, such as the observation of very distant galaxies in the early universe, which emit only very weak radio waves, or the monitoring of changes in trace atmospheric constituents in the Earth's upper atmosphere.""
In addition to Nakajima and Suzuki from the Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research (ISEE) at Nagoya University, the collaborators included researchers from the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, Kawashima Manufacturing Co., and the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology.

Robots are often found in very controlled, indoor environments because, unlike in a natural environment, there are no tripping hazards to overcome. However, in order to perform important tasks like environmental monitoring or search and rescue, robots must be able to navigate through branches and vines without getting tied up.
""When you take robots outdoors, the entire problem of interacting with the environment becomes exponentially more difficult because you have to be more deliberate in everything that you do,"" said David Ologan, a master's student studying mechanical engineering. ""Your system has to be robust enough to handle any unforeseen circumstances or obstructions that you might encounter. It's interesting to tackle that problem that hasn't necessarily been solved yet.""
The research team, led by Aaron Johnson, an associate professor of mechanical engineering, used a quadrupedal-robot to produce a reactive walking strategy. Alternatives like wheeled robots can become stuck in vines or cause damage to the environment.
""Real-world obstacles might be stiff like a rock or soft like a vine, and we want robots to have strategies that prevent tripping on either,"" said Justin Yim, an engineering professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and collaborator on the project.
The research demonstrates a ""momentum-based observer for proprioceptive joint torque estimation suited to classify contacts on a robot's limb as entanglements."" That is, it monitors the motion of its legs to see if any are getting stuck on something and not making progress.
""Legged robots can select footholds and step over things as opposed to just driving over everything,"" Ologan said. ""The problem with this is with every step, you have to reason about your footholds. The system is incredibly delicate. If you bump into a step, your whole robot can fall over, so we need methods to respond to external contact."" Credit: Carnegie Mellon Unviersity, College of Engineering
The environment also affects the efficiency and performance of robots, Ologan explains.
""The potential for legged robots in outdoor, vegetation-based environments is interesting to see,"" he said. ""If you live in a city, a wheeled platform is probably a better option because the infrastructure is already set up. There is a trade-off between being able to do more complex actions and being efficient with your movements.""
The ability for four-legged robots to walk through vegetation can be used in multiple fields and applications, Ologan said. Quadrupeds are now used to survey oil rigs, and improving their capabilities can also aid in rescue missions.
The team tested multiple iterations of Charlie's–the robot's–walking pattern. They found that having the robot reactively retract its legs was the best option in getting it to navigate and untangle itself from obstacles. Other methods, such as high-stepping and a knees-forward approach were not nearly as effective. Through this testing, the team was able to preset a simple leg reaction motion to disentangle from any detected entanglements. This technology to help robots untangle themselves can also be integrated into other robots without having to modify their existing hardware.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A former executive at Samsung Electronics’ venture capital arm who proposed that mobile app developer Branch Metrics’ software offering be expanded in Samsung smartphones faced pushback due to pressure from Google, he said on Thursday in a landmark antitrust trial against the Alphabet unit.
Patrick Chang, who worked at Samsung Next to invest in innovative companies, had urged the parent company to expand the offerings of Branch, which can search within apps, to its Android smartphones.
Branch Metrics founder and former CEO Alexander Austin testified in late September that his company eliminated some of its software’s functions to fend off Google’s complaints as it sought to make deals with wireless carriers and smartphone makers. Branch had to ensure that its searches remained within apps and never linked to the web, Austin noted.
Chang testified that Samsung also faced pushback from wireless carries, like AT&T, which sell Android phones.
Google is accused of paying $10 billion a year based on revenue share agreements to smartphone makers like Samsung Electronics, wireless carriers and others who agree to make its software the default and maintain its monopoly in search.
In its questioning, the Justice Department showed an August 2020 email by Samsung executive David Eun, who complained that “Google is clearly buying its way to squelch competitors.”
Under cross examination by an attorney for Google, Chang was asked about another possible explanation for Samsung’s disinterest in Branch, which is that the software was clunky and few users clicked on links that Branch offered.
Chang testified during the fourth week of a more than two-month trial in which the U.S. Justice Department is seeking to show that Google abused its monopoly of search and some search advertising. Google has said that its business practices were legal.

https://www.reuters.com/innovation/article/britain-tech-regulation/uk-to-examine-amazon-and-microsofts-cloud-dominance-idUSKBN3150A7,UK to examine Amazon and Microsoft's cloud dominance,"LONDON (Reuters) -Britain’s media regulator on Thursday asked the country’s antitrust authority to investigate U.S. tech giants Amazon and Microsoft’s dominance of the UK cloud market.
Ofcom said it had identified features that made it more difficult for UK businesses to use multiple cloud suppliers.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft had a combined 70-80% share of Britain’s public cloud infrastructure services market in 2022, Ofcom said. Google was their closest competitor with 5-10%.
Britain is not the only country looking into cloud computing; the U.S. Federal Trade Commission asked for information about the market in March, citing similar interest in the UK, France, Japan, The Netherlands and South Korea.
“The CMA (Competition and Markets Authority) will now conduct an independent investigation to decide whether there is an adverse effect on competition, and if so, whether it should take action or recommend others to take action,” it said.
Amazon said it disagreed with Ofcom, whose findings were based on “a fundamental misconception of how the IT sector functions, and the services and discounts on offer”.
“Any unwarranted intervention could lead to unintended harm to IT customers and competition,” a spokesperson said.
But it said it would work constructively with the CMA.
Microsoft said it was committed to ensuring the UK cloud industry remained innovative and highly competitive. “We will engage constructively with the CMA,” a Microsoft spokesperson said.
Dan Ridsdale, TMT director at research company Edison, said the dominance of AWS, Microsoft and to a lesser extent Google was replicated across every major economy other than China.
But Britain was the most advanced in addressing the issue, he said, and was now on a path to potentially taking action.

“Other jurisdictions are likely to follow suit and regulatory action of one form or another looks inevitable,” he said.
The French antitrust authority said in June that practices in the sector could potentially restrict competition, while the EU regulator is scrutinising Microsoft’s cloud practices following a complaint by trade group Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe (CISPE) whose members include Amazon.
MICROSOFT-CMA HISTORY
The CMA and Microsoft have already clashed this year when the regulator blocked the company’s $69 billion acquisition of games company Activision Blizzard.
A restructured deal found favour but the episode made clear the CMA’s willingness to take on big tech.
Ofcom said in April it was worried about the practices of AWS and Microsoft because of their market positions in the cloud market, and planned to ask the competition regulator to investigate.
Reuters reported on Tuesday that Ofcom was expected to push for an antitrust investigation.
UK businesses told Ofcom they were concerned it was too difficult to switch or mix and match cloud providers.
“So, we’re referring the market to the CMA for further scrutiny,” Ofcom Director Fergal Farragher said.
The CMA welcomed the move, saying effective competition in the 7.5 billion pound ($9.1 billion) UK market was essential.
Google Vice President Amit Zavery said Ofcom’s referral demonstrated the need to create an open cloud market with no vendor lock-in.

“UK government agencies, businesses, and consumers want to move easily across cloud platforms and choose which services best meet their needs,” he said, adding Google would continue to allow its products to run on any cloud without penalty.
The CMA will complete its investigation by April 2025.

BlackBerry joins a number of companies that have split their units in recent years, favoring a leaner corporate structure to help investors better evaluate their separate businesses.
Earlier this week, the packaged food giant formerly known as Kellogg Co completed its spinoff. Healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson and industrial conglomerate General Electric have also spun off some of their units.
“Both the IoT and Cyber businesses ... address large and growing market opportunities. This new proposed structure will further increase both their operational agility and ability to focus on delivering exceptional solutions,” said BlackBerry CEO John Chen.
U.S.-listed shares of Waterloo, Ontario-based BlackBerry rose more than 4% in trading after the bell. The shares have fallen more than 18% since Reuters reported in August that private equity firm Veritas Capital had made an offer to buy the company.
BlackBerry said in May it would consider strategic options for its portfolio of businesses that could include the possible separation of one or more of its businesses.
Last year, it pulled the plug on its smartphones business and has since been trying to sell its legacy patents related to its mobile devices.
The company went public in 1997 and soon became popular for its ubiquitous business smartphones, which were toted by executives, politicians and legions of fans in the early 2000s.
Last week, the company reported its second-quarter results and posted total revenue of $132 million, down from $168 million a year earlier.

Shares in Clorox last traded at $121.16 after earlier hitting a low of $119.56 and were eying their biggest one-day percentage loss since Feb. 2022.
Late Wednesday, Clorox forecast a loss per share between $0.35 and $0.75 for its fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30, versus a year-ago profit of $0.68. It said net sales would fall year-over-year by 23% to 28%.
After this, Evercore ISI slashed its Clorox price target to $120 from $160 and Raymond James downgraded it to ‘market perform’ from ‘outperform’. Bank of America cut its price target to $120 from $145 while Deutsche Bank dropped its target to $136 from $155.
BoFA analyst Anna Lizzul, who rates Clorox ‘underperform’, said its warning of a first-quarter gross margin decline is “particularly notable” as she had expected it to be “the largest quarter for gross margin expansion” in its fiscal year 2024.
Along with the attack and a challenging consumer environment, Lizzul said rising shipment costs from higher oil prices may also push Clorox to reduce promotalsol activity in fiscal year 2024 to protect margins.
And Lizzul saw “little potential to raise prices,” since it had made four rounds of price increases in the last 2 years.
On Aug 14 Clorox said it took some systems offline after unauthorized activity disrupted operations. Then on Sept. 18 it said first-quarter results could see a “material impact.”
On Sept 29 it said all its manufacturing facilities resumed operations and that it was ramping up production to restock inventories after the attack.
But, Evercore ISI analyst Javier Escalante who rates Clorox ‘underperform,’ voiced concerns about how long the company took to work out the financial impact. He also pointed to its warning about “ongoing, but lessening operational impacts in the second quarter.”
Escalante described this as a “disconcerting” disconnect between operations, financial planning and reporting in his research note.",https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20231005&t=2&i=1646797076&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEJ940Q9,2023-10-05 16:10:41
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/05/paradigm-matt-huang-testimony-sbf-trial-investor-fraud/,'Marked to zero': Paradigm testimony at SBF trial points to investor fraud,"The testimony of Matt Huang, co-founder and managing partner of crypto investment firm Paradigm, at Sam Bankman-Fried’s trial may help the prosecution convince jurors that the former crypto mogul defrauded investors.
Huang testified Thursday that he and his firm were in the dark about a range of business practices at FTX, red flags that would have affected his decision to invest in the company. Namely, FTX’s use of customer funds to prop up Bankman-Fried‘s hedge fund Alameda Research.
Government cooperation aside, Huang likely has his own motives for testifying against Bankman-Fried and distancing his firm from FTX. Paradigm is part of a class-action lawsuit (which was temporarily stayed in June) that accuses it, alongside Sequoia Capital and Thoma Bravo, of promoting FTX to the detriment of its users.
According to Huang’s testimony, Paradigm was duped, as well.
Over two funding rounds between 2021 and 2022, Paradigm invested $278 million into FTX. When prosecutor Thane Rehn asked what Paradigm estimates the current value of that investment to be, Huang replied, “We have marked it to zero.”
That establishes damage has been done in the form of financial losses, one of the things the prosecution will have to establish in order to prove fraud.
The government will also have to establish misrepresentation, showing that the defendant made false statements or concealed material information in order to convince investors to fork over money. Prosecutors also need to prove that the investors relied on Bankman-Fried’s misrepresentations. Finally, they’ll need to demonstrate that Bankman-Fried intended to defraud investors, which could be more difficult.
Huang’s testimony Thursday at least supports the establishment of three out of four of those elements.
Paradigm began considering investment into FTX in 2019, according to Huang. During that time, Huang testified that he was told FTX exchange wallets served as a custodian for customer deposits and would always be available if customers wished to withdraw. He wasn’t told that FTX could take those deposits out and use them for their own business purposes.
When asked if he would have still invested in FTX knowing that, Huang responded, “Likely not.”
“If it became known that they were doing that, I think the exchange would lose credibility in the brand and people wouldn’t want to use it, so it would be existential to the business,” said Huang.
Not only was Huang uninformed about FTX’s habit of using customer deposits for its own purposes, but he also testified that he didn’t know Alameda was able to access those deposits, and wouldn’t have invested in FTX if he had.
“Customer deposits are sort of sacred,” he said.
As Paradigm was considering investment into FTX, Huang said he raised concerns about the link between Alameda and FTX. Mainly, he was worried that Alameda — one of the largest traders on the platform — would get preferential treatment, which would also be damaging to FTX’s reputation.
Bankman-Fried told Huang Alameda didn’t have preferential treatment on the platform. But the prosecution pointed out that Alameda was exempt from FTX’s liquidation engine, a risk management strategy that’s designed to automatically trigger the sale of assets if certain risk parameters are exceeded.
Huang said FTX’s liquidation engine was a big part of why Paradigm was attracted to the company. He also agreed that Alameda’s exemption is inconsistent with Bankman-Fried’s statement that it didn’t get preferential treatment.
“It would have meant that Alameda could trade with leverage on the platform and, if those trades didn’t work out, could ultimately incur a negative balance that would have to be paid for somehow,” said Huang. “In a typical case, that might come from the money we were investing into the company that would go to fund operations. But in any case, it would leave the business at risk of becoming insolvent.”
Rehn also sought to establish that Bankman-Fried made false statements to lull Paradigm into investing. He pulled up an excel spreadsheet that had been attached to an email Bankman-Fried sent to Huang showing FTX’s financial stats as of April 2021. The balance sheet showed FTX’s annualized approximate revenue, estimating a net profit for Q1 2021 of $85 million. Rehn asserted that FTX had moved certain expenses off those financial statements in order to artificially inflate the reported net profits.
Throughout his testimony, Huang repeated that he had also expressed concerns with Bankman-Fried over FTX’s lack of a board and lack of governance, which he said could lead to unintended value leakage. While this did not ultimately stop Paradigm from investing in FTX, Huang testified that “SBF was very resistant to having investors on the board.”","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1708738406.jpg?resize=1200,800",2023-10-06 03:35:40

https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/05/netflix-india-subscribers/,"Netflix's 6.5M India subscribers dwarfed by Prime Video and Disney, Bernstein says","Netflix has “not succeeded” in scaling up its business in India despite the global streaming giant consistently lowering the subscription costs in the country, analysts at AllianceBernstein wrote in a report to clients Thursday.
The U.S. streamer has about 6.5 million subscribers in India, compared to Prime Video’s 20 million in the South Asian market, the analysts wrote. Disney+ Hotstar continues to dominate the market with over 40 million subscribers.
AllianceBernstein attributed Netflix slower growth in India to lack of local content, saying only 12% of the titles the global streamer offers in the country were local content. About 60% of Prime Video’s catalog in India, in comparison, was in domestic languages.
The poor reception in India comes despite Netflix consistently lowering the prices in the country even as it has virtually raised the prices in all other key markets. Netflix inked a “first-of-its-kind” deal with Jio Platforms, India’s largest telecom operator, to bundle the streaming service with the carrier’s pay-as-you-go plans in August.
“Perhaps the lesson from India points to both the need for higher density of local-language content as we described above, but also a recognition that in many emerging markets, value is less tied to a comparison with other streaming services and more tied to a much lower cost of linear TV or Internet video. India, for example, is likely YouTube’s largest market, and a key growth area for social media names,” the analysts wrote.
Netflix didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Disney’s Hotstar continues to dominate its competitors in India, thanks to its cricket streaming offerings, which consistently attract millions of live viewers during matches. The platform is even offering free streaming of the ongoing ICC Cricket World Cup, an event that will last over 45 days, to all mobile users. JioCinema, the latest venture by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, is taking a page from Disney’s strategy — of acquiring rights to high-profile cricket matches — and is increasingly emerging as a formidable contender.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1247248367.jpg?resize=1200,800",2023-10-06 05:33:31

https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/05/all-eyes-on-vw-after-hyundai-kia-adopt-tesla-charging-standard/,"All eyes on VW after Hyundai, Kia adopt Tesla charging standard","Hyundai and Kia have finally announced their plans to adopt Tesla’s North American Charging Standard (NACS) ports for their electric vehicles in the U.S. and Canada, joining the swells of automakers that have also promised to do so.
The move will give Hyundai and Kia drivers — as well as drivers of Ford, General Motors, Mercedes-Benz, Honda and Rivian vehicles — access to thousands of Tesla Superchargers across the two countries and Mexico.
As NACS seems to outstrip the Combined Charging System (CCS) as the new charging standard, the question on the auto industry’s mind is when will Volkswagen ante up?
In June, VW’s EV charging subsidiary Electrify America said it would add the NACS connector to Electrify America and Electrify Canada’s fast charging networks by 2025. Many thought that day wouldn’t happen, given how much money VW had to shell out to build that CCS-based charging network in the first place. VW poured $2 billion into building out the Electrify America (EA) as part of a settlement of the VW diesel emissions scandal.
Like most other charging companies, EA said it would continue to provide CCS connectors throughout its network, as well. And Tesla will include CCS connectors at some of its U.S. charging stations to reap some of the rewards of the Biden administration’s IRA subsidies. Tesla’s Supercharger network accounts for about 60% of fast chargers in the U.S., according to the Department of Energy.
Volkswagen didn’t respond in time to TechCrunch’s request for comment, but the company has been in talks with Tesla to adopt the NACS charge port on future vehicles since summer 2023. VW is one of the largest automakers in the world, representing brands like Audi, Bentley, Bugatti, Porsche and Lamborghini.
Over the next few years, under the VW brand, the automaker hopes to release a range of new EV models, including the 2024 ID.3, 2024 ID.7 and the 2025 ID.7 Wagon.
Most of the automakers that have signed up to build EVs equipped with NACS ports are aiming for 2025 models. Hyundai is aiming for even earlier.
The automaker said Thursday that new Hyundai EVs in the U.S. — like the Ioniq 5, Ioniq 6 and upcoming Ioniq 7 — will come with the NACS port starting in the fourth quarter of 2024. That will begin in Canada in the first half of 2025. Genesis, Hyundai’s luxury brand, will also jump on the NACS train.
Kia also said it would build the NACS port into new EVs sold in North America in the fourth quarter of 2024.
Both Hyundai and Kia said they expect to have adapters available at dealers in the first quarter of 2025, for customers who own vehicles with CCS ports.
Tesla’s NACS is quickly becoming the industry standard, in part due to Tesla’s already strong footprint of Superchargers at good locations along highways. EV drivers also say Tesla offers a more streamlined and simpler charging process.
In late June, SAE International, formerly the Society of Automotive Engineers, said it would develop an industry standard around NACS, which would assuage other companies wary of letting a competitor control a key part of the EV experience.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GettyImages-1252172149.jpg?resize=1200,736",2023-10-05 23:17:53

Thus goes the central premise of deterrence theory, which says it is the credible threat of aggression — not the use of aggression — that will ensure states avoid war.
This theory has dominated much of America’s strategic thinking over the past 50-plus years, but new technologies and new adversaries threaten to upend the status quo. For the first time, China has started to outpace the U.S. in critical weapons programs — the country developed a new type of weapon called a hypersonic glide vehicle as early as 2014, which can strike Taipei and the Taiwan Strait in about 20 minutes from the country’s strategic bases in the South China Sea. America’s comparative sluggishness to develop such tech could result in the U.S. falling catastrophically behind its adversaries.

The 11-month-old defense startup wants to completely rethink defense hardware development for complex systems, starting with long-range strike hypersonic weapons, a capability that Castelion co-founder and CEO Bryon Hargis called “a national, strategic-level non-nuclear deterrent.”
“China is going faster than us in basically every area,” he said. “They pass the U.S. in some areas, but if you give them enough time, they’re going to pass us in all areas if we don’t do something different. It’s, in my opinion, existential. We grew up in an era of fairly good security and I don’t know necessarily that our children are to have that opportunity if somebody doesn’t do something about it.”
Making American deterrence credible again
Castelion was founded by a trio of ex-SpaceXers, Bryon Hargis, Sean Pitt and Andrew Kreitz, in November 2022. The company is part of a wave of new defense tech startups that have little faith in large American primes and their ability to ensure the country retains its dominant position in the global asymmetry of military power.
In a blog post announcing Castelion, the trio say as much, writing that conditions in the defense industrial base, like consolidation, production delays and ballooning program costs, “have left our nation in a worse position to protect democracy and confront our adversaries around the world.”
The startup wants to do things differently: move faster, design hardware to be produced at scale, and vertically integrate to cut costs. Pitt said that long-range strike weapons were a clear opportunity for an agile hardware development approach.
Its thesis has caught investor support, with the company closing a $14.2 million initial funding round co-led by Andreessen Horowitz and Lavrock Ventures, with participation from First In, BlueYard Capital and Champion Hill Ventures.
Castelion’s founding team is notable for their individual success in the aerospace industry. Hargis, a mechanical engineer by training, joined SpaceX in 2017 and eventually became a senior director of government sales, essentially building out an entire government sales team and that enormous line of business for the company; Pitt was the original salesperson for SpaceX’s hugely successful ride-share program and eventually became director of launch and human spaceflight sales for the European continent; and Kreitz was a senior investment banker at Goldman Sachs before joining SpaceX as senior finance manager.
Hargis and Pitt worked alongside each other at SpaceX’s D.C. office, and Hargis and Kreitz worked directly together regarding finance matters. The three would talk on the evenings and weekends, Pitt said, and the thesis for the company started forming. It was clear that they would have to leave SpaceX if they wanted to focus on defense hardware: SpaceX is not a defense company, even if its technologies do much to serve the national interest.
“SpaceX is fundamentally a Mars company,” Kreitz said. “It will do great defense work if it’s along that development path, but [it] isn’t core, and that’s what precipitated us leaving.”
Hargis echoed these comments: “I think we did some amazing work at SpaceX for national security that will continue to pay dividends for the country for probably multiple decades to come. But I really wanted to be more focused on defense than SpaceX wanted to be.”
Castelion is kicking off its focus on hypersonic missile systems. The U.S. wants to procure these capabilities for a handful of reasons, many of which have to do with the particulars of the Western Pacific theater. These systems offer a big boost in range without a commensurate energy cost, which is critical for safely covering the roughly 1,800 miles between the U.S. territory of Guam and the coast of China. As two officials from the U.S. Department of Defense put it in a recent op-ed, all of the missiles in America’s arsenal “appropriate for the Western Pacific theater” will need to fly at Mach speeds.
Hypersonic missiles are also highly maneuverable, which makes it difficult to predict where they will strike. But perhaps most importantly, they offer a non-nuclear deterrence option — a way for both the United States and China to avoid a severely catastrophic outcome that both countries have vowed to avoid via the adoption of no-first use policies.
Of course, Castelion can’t simply turn up on Uncle Sam’s doorstep one day with a fully finished hypersonic weapon and a bill. Instead, the El Segundo, California–based startup is taking time to build its credibility with missile subsystems: solid rocket motors, low-cost avionics and ultra-high temperature ceramic matrix composite (CMC) materials. The idea is to first become a supplier to a prime working on an existing hypersonic missile program, before eventually building complete missile systems all in-house.
Because rapid design-build-test cycles are built into the company’s strategic mission, the company is also focused on building a hypersonic test platform both for customers looking to test and for in-house testing.
Castelion’s primary engineering efforts, which include developing the avionics and manufacturing the high-temperature CMCs, are taking place in El Segundo. Castelion also has a special use permit for outside of Naval Air Station Fallon in Nevada to do rocket motor production and testing. Looking ahead, the company plans on conducting its first full flight test of its solid motors using a single-stage rocket later this year, and the company plans on scaling its materials testing, starting with a subscale hypersonic glide vehicle shell to demonstrate that it can make complex shapes using the CMC material.
Next year, the 15-person company is planning on making a two-stage test vehicle. It also plans on executing out its three government contracts (the details of which the company couldn’t disclose) and to continue building out its team. It’s more than a little ambitious.
“We’re fairly used to being called crazy,” Hargis joked. “I could see it from the outside, being slightly skeptical, but I think that after you’ve done several crazy things successfully, you realize it’s not crazy to dream big.”","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image003.jpg?resize=1200,800",2023-10-05 22:30:01
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/05/sbf-trial-gary-wang/,Alameda had a $65B line of credit and 'unlimited withdrawals',"The Sam Bankman-Fried trial gained steam after a somewhat sleepier first half of the day. That’s when prosecutors and the defense asked a witness and former FTX developer about the technical details of the crypto exchange as well as Alameda Research.
But that changed around 4 p.m. when FTX co-founder and CTO Gary Wang took the stand, wearing a wrinkled suit. Prior to Wang taking the stand, there was a 15-minute break during which Bankman-Fried looked visibly irritated.
Bankman-Fried’s parents were also there. During the break, they went to their son seemingly in an effort to provide support. At one point his father, Joseph Bankman, patted his mother, Barbara Fried, on the back, said something and laughed. She didn’t laugh back but continued to look away toward her son.
On the stand, Wang admitted that he committed wire fraud, securities fraud and commodities fraud. He added that Bankman-Fried, Nishad Singh and Caroline Ellison were the individuals he committed the crimes with.
Wang, Singh and Ellison pleaded guilty in late December 2022 as part of a deal to cooperate with the government and testify during this trial.
Wang said that they were given “special privileges from Alameda Research,” the crypto trading firm that he said he and Bankman-Fried started prior to launching FTX. Those privileges included getting large lines of credit, unlimited withdrawals and being able to have negative balances. Wang said that the “unlimited funds” came from FTX customers; a special code was added to customer transactions that funneled the money to Alameda.
He shared during his testimony that he was in charge of writing and reviewing code. And while Bankman-Fried did not write the code, Wang said Bankman-Fried did tell him and other developers what to implement. “Sometimes we talked [disagreements] out, but in the end, it’s Sam’s decision,” Wang said.
Negative balances, unlimited withdrawals
Because of these special privileges, Alameda had a $65 billion line of credit, Wang said. “Normal large businesses have single to double digits [of credit] in the millions.” By the time the two businesses filed for bankruptcy in mid November 2022, Alameda withdrew $8 billion, Wang said.
These internal financial advantages were not disclosed to the public, he shared.
Alameda and FTX were both started by Bankman-Fried and Wang, with ownership split 90% and 10%, and then 17% equity and 65% equity, respectively. Singh also had 5% equity of FTX, and a number of outside investors held other positions, Wang noted.
The ownership percentages never changed, he added. At the time, both Wang and Bankman-Fried were billionaires.
During his time at the companies, Wang also disclosed that Alameda “loaned” him around $200 million to $300 million. But the money never went to his bank account, and it instead went to investments that FTX made into other companies.
Naming the business
The company also picked its name to outsmart other businesses, which might have negative connotations toward companies with crypto jargon in their titles. “Alameda” derived from Alameda County in California and “Research,” was because it “sounds prestigious” and is not using a crypto-related name, Wang said.
The initial funds for Alameda came from Bankman-Fried personally as well as various lenders. Wang said Bankman-Fried also believed it would be easier to get bank accounts, rental leases, investors and so on, with a more “normal” company name.
The prosecutors aired a clip of Bankman-Fried from April 2021 on a podcast, where he explained Alameda’s name. “If we named our company Shitcoin Day Trader’s Inc., no one would do business [with us],” he said at the time.
Wang’s testimony is expected to continue on Friday morning until midday, according to prosecutors at the trial.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ftx-broken-on-fire.jpg?resize=1200,645",2023-10-05 21:35:03
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/05/spyhide-oospy-hacked-phone-spyware-shuts-down/,Hacked phone spyware shuts down… again,"A short-lived spyware operation called Oospy, which emerged earlier this year after its predecessor Spyhide was hacked, is no longer operational and has shut down.
Oospy appeared online in late July as a rebrand of a phone monitoring app called Spyhide, which was facilitating the surveillance of tens of thousands of Android device owners around the world. Spyhide shut down after a breach exposed the operation and its administrators who were profiting from it.
Although Spyhide’s website disappeared from the internet after the hack burned the operation, the spyware’s back-end server stayed online and was still communicating with the tens of thousands of phones it was monitoring since the server was hosted on an entirely different domain. That allowed the administrators to rebrand Spyhide to Oospy without affecting the spyware operation itself.
That back-end server, which stored the victim’s stolen phone data from thousands of Android devices around the world, was taken offline Thursday by the web host Hetzner, which said the service violated its terms of service.
“In addition, we have terminated the customer’s server contract in due time,” Christian Fitz, a spokesperson for Hetzner, told TechCrunch.
In their time online, Spyhide and Oospy had at least 60,000 victims across the world, including thousands of victims in the United States. These stalkerware (also known as spouseware) apps are planted on a victim’s phone, often by someone with knowledge of their passcode. Once planted, these apps continually steal a victim’s contacts, messages, photos, call logs and recordings, and granular location history.
Following the Spyhide hack, TechCrunch identified two of the administrators behind Spyhide and Oospy. One of the administrators, Mohammad (also goes by Mojtaba) Arasteh, confirmed to TechCrunch that he worked on the project “several years ago as a programmer,” but denied involvement with Oospy.
But a mistake on Oospy’s checkout page, which used PayPal to process customer payments, exposed the name of the PayPal account holder, who shares the same family name as Arasteh.
It’s not uncommon for spyware operations to rely on payment services like PayPal to handle customer payments, despite PayPal’s policies broadly prohibiting customers from using its service to buy or sell software that facilitate illegal activity, like spyware. PayPal spokesperson Caitlin Girouard did not comment on the accounts when reached by TechCrunch. Oospy stopped accepting PayPal for payments a short time later, though it’s not known if PayPal took action against the account.
Arasteh did not comment on the PayPal account when contacted by TechCrunch. Soon after contacting Arasteh, Oospy’s website went offline altogether.
The shutdown of the spyware’s back-end server marks the end of Spyhide and Oospy’s ability to operate, for now.
Oospy and Spyhide are the latest phone surveillance operations to drop off the internet in recent months. Polish-made stalkerware LetMeSpy shut down after an earlier data breach in June. And last year, one of the largest known Android spyware apps, SpyTrac, disappeared following a TechCrunch investigation linked the spyware operation to Support King, which was banned from the surveillance industry by the FTC following an earlier data breach.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/android-spyware-malloc.jpg?resize=1200,751",2023-10-05 21:15:51
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/05/sec-to-compel-elon-musks-testimony-in-twitter-stock-purchase-probe/,SEC to compel Elon Musk's testimony in Twitter stock purchase probe,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will try to force Elon Musk to testify over his Twitter stock purchases.
The federal agency charged with regulating securities markets is currently investigating Musk for allegedly violating securities laws when he bought Twitter shares before buying the social media platform, which he has since renamed X.
Buying Twitter stock before acquiring the company could mean Musk was guilty of insider trading, market manipulation or even violation for fair market disclosure.
The SEC said on Thursday that Musk failed to appear to testify last month as requested. According to a filing by the agency in federal court in San Francisco, first spotted by Bloomberg, the agency is auditing Musk’s statements and disclosures about the stock transactions.
Since the SEC began its probe in April 2022, Musk has sent hundreds of documents and testified twice in July 2022, according to the filing. The investigation is ongoing and nonpublic.
The agency said Musk agreed to an interview with the SEC last month in San Francisco, but two days before the scheduled September 15 meeting, the billionaire raised objections, saying San Francisco wasn’t a good location for it. He has claimed that San Francisco jurors dislike him after a questionnaire sent out to 200 prospective jurors came back with majority negative opinions of Musk.
The SEC suggested moving the interview to Fort Worth, Texas, where Musk resides, but the agency says he refused to meet at all.
This isn’t Musk’s first tussle with the SEC. Famously, the Tesla CEO has been ordered to have a lawyer review his Tesla-related tweets after Musk tweeted in 2018 that he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private for $420 per share and that investor support for the deal was confirmed. Tesla’s share price fluctuated in the weeks that followed, which prompted an SEC investigation into whether Musk had committed securities fraud.
The SEC is also investigating Musk and Tesla over their claims regarding Tesla vehicles’ “full self-driving” capabilities, as well as Tesla’s use of company funds to build Musk a “glass house.“","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-1234732042.jpg?resize=1200,675",2023-10-05 21:15:11
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/05/stoke-space-raises-100m-series-b-as-it-looks-to-reach-orbit-by-2025/,Stoke Space raises $100M Series B as it looks to reach orbit by 2025,"Stoke Space is flying high. Fresh on the heels of a successful test of its reusable second stage, the four-year-old startup announced today that it closed $100 million in new funding led by Industrious Ventures.
This newest round of funding included participation from the University of Michigan, Sparta Group, Long Journey and other investors. Existing investors Breakthrough Energy, Y Combinator, Point72 Ventures, NFX, MaC Ventures, Toyota Ventures and In-Q-Tel also participated. Stoke has now raised $175 million to date, including a $65 million Series A the company closed in December 2021.
Stoke said it would use the new capital to fund the development of its first rocket, which the company has finally christened, giving it the name “Nova.” That includes the development of the first-stage engine and structure, an orbital version of the second stage and building out launch infrastructure at Cape Canaveral in Florida.
The company recently completed a critical “hop” test of its reusable upper stage, successfully flying the development vehicle to an altitude of around 30 feet and vertically landing it about 15 feet away. While those numbers might seem unimpressive on the face of it, the hop proved out the stage’s novel oxygen-hydrogen rocket engine design. Unlike other nozzled rocket engines, the one on Stoke’s second stage is a distributed system, with thrusters that ring the circumference of the second stage.
The flight essentially concluded the development cycle of the second stage, meaning that the architecture is now complete and the company can move on to the rest of the vehicle’s structure. As Stoke co-founder CEO Andy Lapsa told TechCrunch last month, the company had to finalize the architecture of the second stage before building out the rest of the vehicle.
“The first step on our journey was figuring out what a fully reusable upper stage and space vehicle looks like,” he said. “We really believe that it’s hard to build the rest of the vehicle until you know an answer. So that’s why a lot of our focus so far has been on the reusable second stage.”
The company also announced that multinational chemical company Linde plc’s chairman, Steve Angel, will join Stoke’s board of directors. Angel is the former CEO of Linde and also sits on the board of GE.
The new funding will no doubt aid the company as it looks to conduct its first orbital flight test in 2025.
“We are pushing really hard to get to orbit by 2025,” Lapsa said. “There are some interesting opportunities there to do things even before that. That’s our target. We’re going to step back from this a little bit, recalibrate, crystallize our plan. We do have a plan. We’re just going to get more energy behind it and then get back to knocking off milestones.”","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/20230917-DSC_0796.jpg?resize=1200,797",2023-10-05 21:00:42
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/05/lawsuit-alleges-discriminatory-pay-schemes-at-spacex/,Lawsuit alleges discriminatory pay schemes at SpaceX,"SpaceX is facing a class action lawsuit over allegations that the company pays women and minority employees less than their white and male colleagues.
The lawsuit was filed on Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court by SpaceX engineer Ashley Foltz, who says she was hired at a salary of $92,000, even though men with similar or less experience were offered as much as $115,000. According to her LinkedIn, Ashley was hired in September 2022 as a propulsion engineer. She did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.
According to the complaint, Foltz learned about the salary discrepancies when a new California law went into effect requiring employers to include pay scale in their job postings. The salary range for her job was $95,000 to $115,000, so SpaceX gave her a raise — but only to the lowest end of the band.
The lawsuit further alleged that job titles — like “technical writer” versus “engineer 1” — are used as a way to pay women and minorities lower pay. For example, these groups “are forced to work as engineers under a different title of technical writer” and are subsequently paid less, the complaint says. Promotion rates also differ between woman and minorities and their white and male peers, it says.
This is not the first time claims of discriminatory hiring and promotion practices have been lobbed at SpaceX. In August, the U.S. Department of Justice brought a suit against the company for allegedly discriminating against asylum recipients and refugees in hiring under the guise of adhering to export control laws.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1230844804.jpg?resize=1200,800",2023-10-05 20:10:50
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/05/how-to-stretch-your-venture-dollars/,How to stretch your venture dollars,"I didn’t know exactly where I was driving, but the sun was setting behind a field full of cows, the battery in my hybrid was nearly depleted, and the fuel light was blinking. I needed a plan.
Despite intermittent cell phone service, I navigated to a gas station, driving 5 miles per hour the entire way. If you’re managing runway at a seed-stage or Series A startup in Q3 2023, that’s what English majors call an allegory.
Follow-on financing is hard to raise these days, which means founders must watch their spending like hawks while keeping the peace with their investors like sweet, cooing doves.
Which proofs are investors looking for before they’ll commit to additional funding, what’s an acceptable burn rate, and how much runway do you need before raising more? At TechCrunch Disrupt, I spoke to three early-stage VCs to get their unfiltered advice for founders who are trying to keep the lights on long enough to reach product-market fit:
Anamitra Banerji, managing partner and founder, Afore Capital
Frédérique Dame, general partner, Google Ventures
Rick Yang, partner and head of technology, NEA
When is it time to start raising your next round?
If you haven’t found traction with customers and aren’t generating revenue, you should be in fundraising mode already.
“Pre product-market fit, you want to have as much runway as possible because that’s really the goal of being a seed stage startup,” Yang said. “It used to be [that] maybe you have six months of runway left, and you go and raise your next round. Now, more is better because of the market being a little bit more volatile.”
If you haven’t found traction with customers and aren’t generating revenue, you should be in fundraising mode already.
Series A fundraising “is much trickier now,” Dame said. “If you don’t have the right vision and the right unit economics, it’s really hard to raise the next round.” These days, it’s not enough to simply show “your path to profitability,” she added. “This is really an exercise of building great partnerships with investors so when you set up to raise, it makes it easier for you.”
A pre-seed startup generally needs at least 18 months of runway, Banerji said. “It allows you to make a number of tries without overhiring, pivot if you need to, [and] essentially figure out [how to get from] the first five customers to a pathway to a million ARR.”
Follow-on funding is a challenge, “but there’s a lot of capital available now, just from angels or just from pre-seed or seed funds,” he added. “So getting to $500K to $2 million is very achievable in a couple of months’ time frame.”
Every panelist agreed that a founder should know their burn rate and remaining cash balance off the top of their head: “It gives me a lot of comfort when they have basically thought about and are marinating and are obsessing over every aspect of their business,” Yang said.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/53204504241_835307ecce_k.jpg?resize=1200,800",2023-10-05 19:44:09
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/05/hungryroot-founder-debuts-every-an-ai-powered-app-for-self-reflection-and-human-connection/,"Hungryroot founder debuts Every, an AI-powered app for self-reflection and human connection","As founder and CEO of healthy grocery delivery service Hungryroot, Ben McKean has been investigating the power of AI technologies to improve his business. But with the launch of his new side project — an app called Every — McKean wants to explore the use of AI to help people establish deeper relationships with themselves and others and to find common ground.
Currently structured as a nonprofit, Every’s iOS app leverages AI technologies to create “thought-provoking games” aimed at self-discovery.
For example, all users begin with a game called “Inner Odyssey” that challenges you to pick a photo that best represents the place you’d like to explore, from options like a cobblestoned city street, a natural landscape featuring a river and trees, a fantastical castle, or a remote island. You’re then asked follow-up questions like who would you travel with, what role would you play, what advice for your trip resonates with you best and so on.
As you play, the app shows you how others respond to the same question, and when you finish you’re prompted to see who among your connections — that is, your uploaded contact list — also answered similarly.
McKean says the idea to create an app focused on human connection was an idea that’s been brewing for some time — particularly after the COVID pandemic led to a world where everyone felt more disconnected than ever.
“There’s a very large number of people who feel disconnected from even people very close to them,” he explains. “Fifty-eight percent of Americans report feeling like no one in their life knows them well, which was just a shocking stat. And 70% of Americans feel that distrust is hurting American society,” McKean notes, citing various stats on the loneliness epidemic and connection.
In addition, McKean says he also feels impacted by these issues through his own entrepreneurial experiences leading teams and finding how difficult it can be to form connections at work. In fact, McKean foresees the potential to tweak Every’s model for use in the workplace to help colleagues bond, but with fewer personal questions.
Despite the app’s focus on human connectivity, it may be a surprise, then, to learn that Every’s games were created using AI — specifically, by training large language models and leveraging technology from OpenAI and Midjourney. In addition to scratching his own itch, so to speak, McKean said this process helped him to develop his AI skills, which could impact his main business at Hungryroot, which is a heavily AI-driven company.
All the games in the app are inspired by a topic or a person, which is the initial input for the AI.
For the latter, the company is partnering with inspirational leaders for some of the topics, like Hector Guadalupe, founder of A Second U Foundation, which helps people develop skills to be successful in life after serving time in prison. The topic or the person is used to set the context for the generative AI. Then the team uses a structured format for the games they built into the prompts to create the questions. (Guadalupe’s AI-inspired game will release on October 25).
The AI’s output may still need some human intervention as the team has only been training their models for six months, McKean notes, but essentially, the AI creates the games in their entirety. The images that accompany the game’s questions are then created using Midjourney.
The plan is to release one new game every day — hence the app’s name — with each day of the week having a particular theme. For example, Monday’s games may be focused on careers, while Friday’s games may be about fun, Saturday’s games may be about family connections, and Sunday’s are about spirituality or philosophy. McKean says Every also intends the games to be tailored to timely events. So in the case of the upcoming presidential elections, you might see a game tied to politics, for example.
After playing the games, the app offers inspirational content to explore based on your responses, like videos that highlight particular topics — like pursuing your dreams or the importance of creativity.
Another tab in the app, “Map,” uses AI to generate a map of your traits based on the points you earn while playing Every’s games. After trying out the first game, the map informed me my top traits included things like reason and happiness in the simplest things, which I don’t think I’d dispute. You can also thumbs up and thumbs down its findings if you agree or disagree to improve its analysis.
The idea is that, by playing these games, you aren’t only developing more self-awareness, you’re also learning how you share common ground with other people you know, which could lead you to deepen those relationships. For instance, you might find an old friend also enjoys international travel or your colleague prioritizes humility in the workplace. As you learn from the insights the app shares, you may be inspired to take further action, like engaging in conversations about your discoveries.
“A lot of the mission around this is about facilitating connection with people — one to one connection — but it’s also about helping to surface common ground a little more holistically,” McKean says. “And so part of the belief is that if you present the same game to every single person, you’re able to actually find common ground between two people who may be very different people.”
Every was self-funded by McKean and is run by two women, Sarah McKean (Ben’s cousin) and Maya Valliath, while app development was handled through an outsourced firm. The plan for now is to run Every as a free app and side project. But if it takes off, McKean is leaving the door open to scale it as more of a business, potentially with investor backing.
The app has been running in beta since March, but today launched publicly on the App Store. It’s available as a free download with no in-app purchases.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/every-app.jpeg?w=800,2023-10-05 19:17:51
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/05/future-of-ai-survey/,10 investors talk about the future of AI and what lies beyond the ChatGPT hype,"10 investors talk about the future of AI and what lies beyond the ChatGPT hype
When I mentioned “the rise of AI” in a recent email to investors, one of them sent me an interesting reply: “The ‘rise of AI’ is a bit of a misnomer.”
What that investor, Rudina Seseri, a managing partner at Glasswing Ventures, means to say is that sophisticated technologies like AI and deep learning have been around for a long time now, and all this hype around AI is ignoring the simple fact that they have been in development for decades. “We saw the earliest enterprise adoption in 2010,” she pointed out.
Still, we can’t deny that AI is enjoying unprecedented levels of attention, and companies across sectors around the world are busy pondering the impact it could have on their industry and beyond.
Dr. Andre Retterath, a partner at Earlybird Venture Capital, feels several factors are working in tandem to generate this momentum. “We are witnessing the perfect AI storm, where three major ingredients that evolved throughout the past 70 years have finally come together: Advanced algorithms, large-scale datasets, and access to powerful compute,” he said.
Still, we couldn’t help but be skeptical at the number of teams that pitched a version of “ChatGPT for X” at Y Combinator’s winter Demo Day earlier this year. How likely is it that they will still be around in a few years?
Karin Klein, a founding partner at Bloomberg Beta, thinks it’s better to run the race and risk failing than sit it out, since this is not a trend companies can afford to ignore. “While we’ve seen a bunch of ‘copilots for [insert industry]’ that may not be here in a few years, the bigger risk is to ignore the opportunity. If your company isn’t experimenting with using AI, now is the time or your business will fall behind.”
And what’s true for the average company is even more true for startups: Failing to give at least some thought to AI would be a mistake. But a startup also needs to be ahead of the game more than the average company does, and in some areas of AI, “now” may already be “too late.”
To better understand where startups still stand a chance, and where oligopoly dynamics and first-mover advantages are shaping up, we polled a select group of investors about the future of AI, which areas they see the most potential in, how multilingual LLMs and audio generation could develop, and the value of proprietary data.
This is the first of a three-part survey that aims to dive deep into AI and how the industry is shaping up. In the next two parts to be published soon, you will hear from other investors on the various parts of the AI puzzle, where startups have the highest chance of winning, and where open source might overtake closed source.
We spoke with:
Manish Singhal, founding partner, pi Ventures
Will today’s leading gen AI models and the companies behind them retain their leadership in the coming years?
This is a dynamically changing landscape when it comes to applications of LLMs. Many companies will form in the application domain, and only a few will succeed in scaling. In terms of foundation models, we do expect OpenAI to get competition from other players in the future. However, they have a strong head start and it will not be easy to dislodge them.
Which AI-related companies do you feel aren’t innovative enough to still be around in 5 years?
I think in the applied AI space, there should be significant consolidation. AI is becoming more and more horizontal, so it will be challenging for applied AI companies, which are built on off-the-shelf models, to retain their moats.
However, there is quite a bit of fundamental innovation happening on the applied front as well as on the infrastructure side (tools and platforms). They are likely to do better than the others.
Is open source the most obvious go-to-market route for AI startups?
It depends on what you are solving for. For the infrastructure layer companies, it is a valid path, but it may not be that effective across the board. One has to consider whether open source is a good route or not based on the problem they are solving.
Do you wish there were more LLMs trained in other languages than English? Besides linguistic differentiation, what other types of differentiation do you expect to see?
We are seeing LLMs in other languages as well, but of course, English is the most widely used. Based on the local use cases, LLMs in different languages definitely make sense.
Besides linguistic differentiation, we expect to see LLM variants that are specialized in certain domains (e.g., medicine, law and finance) to provide more accurate and relevant information within those areas. There is already some work happening in this area, such as BioGPT and Bloomberg GPT.
LLMs suffer from hallucination and relevance when you want to use them in real production-grade applications. I think there will be considerable work done on that front to make them more usable out of the box.
What are the chances of the current LLM method of building neural networks being disrupted in the upcoming quarters or months?
It can surely happen, although it may take longer than a few months. Once quantum computing goes mainstream, the AI landscape will change significantly again.
Given the hype around ChatGPT, are other media types like generative audio and image generation comparatively underrated?
Multimodal generative AI is picking up pace. For most of the serious applications, one will need those to build, especially for images and text. Audio is a special case: There is significant work happening in auto-generation of music and speech cloning, which has wide commercial potential.
Besides these, auto-generation of code is becoming more and more popular, and generating videos is an interesting dimension — we will soon see movies completely generated by AI!
Are startups with proprietary data more valuable in your eyes these days than they were before the rise of AI?
Contrary to what the world may think, proprietary data gives a good head start, but eventually, it is very difficult to keep your data proprietary.
Hence, the tech moat comes from a combination of intelligently designed algorithms that are productized and fine-tuned for an application along with the data.
When could AGI become a reality, if ever?
We are getting close to human levels with certain applications, but we are still far from a true AGI. I also believe that it is an asymptotic curve after a while, so it may take a very long time to get there across the board.
For true AGI, several technologies, like neurosciences and behavioral science, may also have to converge.
Is it important to you that the companies you invest in get involved in lobbying and/or discussion groups around the future of AI?
Not really. Our companies are more targeted toward solving specific problems, and for most applications, lobbying does not help. It’s useful to participate in discussion groups, as one can keep a tab on how things are developing.

Will today’s leading gen AI models and the companies behind them retain their leadership in the coming years?
The foundation layer model providers such as Alphabet, Microsoft/OpenAI and Meta will likely maintain their market leadership and function as an oligopoly over the long-term. However, there are opportunities for competition in models that provide significant differentiation, like Cohere and other well-funded players at the foundational level, placing a strong emphasis on trust and privacy.
We have not invested and likely will not invest in the foundation layer of generative AI. This layer will probably end in one of two states: In one scenario, the foundation layer will have oligopoly dynamics akin to what we saw with the cloud market, where a select few players will capture most of the value.
The other possibility is that foundation models are largely supplied by the open source ecosystem. We see the application layer holding the biggest opportunity for founders and venture investors. Companies that deliver tangible, measurable value to their customers can displace large incumbents in existing categories and dominate new ones.
Our investment strategy is explicitly focused on companies offering value-added technology that augments foundation models.
Just as value creation in the cloud did not end with the cloud computing infrastructure providers, significant value creation has yet to arrive across the gen AI stack. The gen AI race is far from over.
Which AI-related companies do you feel aren’t innovative enough to still be around in 5 years?
A few market segments in AI might not be sustainable as long-term businesses. One such example is the “GPT wrapper” category — solutions or products built around OpenAI’s GPT technology. These solutions lack differentiation and can be easily disrupted by features launched by existing dominant players in their market. As such, they will struggle to maintain a competitive edge in the long run.
Similarly, companies that do not provide significant business value or do not solve a problem in a high-value, expensive space will not be sustainable businesses. Consider this: A solution streamlining a straightforward task for an intern will not scale into a significant business, unlike a platform that resolves complex challenges for a chief architect, offering distinct and high-value benefits.
Finally, companies with products that do not seamlessly integrate within current enterprise workflows and architectures, or require extensive upfront investments, will face challenges in implementation and adoption. This will be a significant obstacle for successfully generating meaningful ROI, as the bar is far higher when behavior changes and costly architecture changes are required.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1477386306.jpg?resize=1200,679",2023-10-05 19:15:45

I’ve been taking a bit of an electronics detox, meaning I haven’t been looking at my phone — or laptop — for most of this week. As a reporter, that seems ridiculous. But when I say I’ve spent the past few days in the Southern District of New York (SDNY) federal court, that might make more sense, given that they confiscate most people’s electronics (as I learned, this includes AirPods!).
The SDNY is becoming a second home for me because the highly anticipated trial for Sam Bankman-Fried, often referred to as SBF, has begun. If you don’t know who he is or what he’s allegedly done, we’ve got a refresher for you.
Before FTX collapsed and filed for bankruptcy, Bankman-Fried also apparently had a plan to buy off former President Trump, to get him to not run for re-election, author Michael Lewis shared in a 60 Minutes broadcast interview. How much would that cost? Apparently, $5 billion.
I’ll be in-and-out of the courthouse over the next six weeks, following the trial closely. Prosecutors shared that Matt Huang, co-founder and managing partner of Paradigm, and Gary Wang, co-founder of FTX, are on the docket to testify this week as witnesses.
Prior to Paradigm, Huang was a partner at Sequoia Capital; both firms previously invested in FTX, so we imagine the testimony will dive into investors’ losses from the crypto exchange’s downfall.
As for Wang, well, he co-founded FTX with Bankman-Fried but agreed to take a plea deal in December 2022. This means Wang is cooperating with authorities in exchange for a better sentencing, which the judge presiding over the case mentioned to jurors on Wednesday.
For the most in-depth trial coverage to date, check out everything that has transpired below.

The latest pod
For this week’s episode, Chain Reaction (and Jacquelyn) did a crossover episode with Alex Wilhelm, editor in chief of TechCrunch+ and co-host of Equity, TechCrunch’s podcast focused on the business of startups.
The highly anticipated criminal trial for Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of now-bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, started on Tuesday to determine whether he’s guilty of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy.
Jacquelyn has been on the ground at the Southern District of New York courthouse, listening in to the trial in the same room as Bankman-Fried, so there was lots to talk about.
We dove deep into what transpired the first two days of Bankman-Fried’s trial, as well as who the jurors are, the first two witnesses and who else is expected to speak. We also got into the nitty-gritty details, which you can’t read about on a transcript.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/05/paypal-faces-new-antitrust-lawsuit-claiming-it-unfairly-stifles-competition-with-stripe-shopify-and-more/,"PayPal faces new antitrust lawsuit claiming it unfairly stifles competition with Stripe, Shopify and more","PayPal has been hit with a class action lawsuit by consumers represented by law firm Hagens Berman alleging that the fintech giant’s anti-steering rules stifle competition against lower-cost payment platforms such as Stripe and Shopify.
Specifically, according to an investigation conducted by the firm’s consumer rights attorneys, PayPal has subjected consumers to excess charges when purchasing from online merchants that accept PayPal or Venmo.
The suit states that PayPal’s merchant agreements, which all merchants must sign to accept payments via its platform, leads to consumers paying more to make purchases. The attorneys charge that “if PayPal’s agreements were transparent, consumers would quickly see a price difference between PayPal and Venmo and its competitors.”
Specifically, per PayPal’s anti-steering rules, if a retailer accepts PayPal or Venmo payments, they agree not to offer any discounts or inducements to persuade consumers to use other payment options that have a lower cost. These discounts are treated as a “surcharge” on PayPal transactions and prohibited by PayPal’s anti-steering rules.
Merchants also cannot tell customers that other payment methods are more cost-effective or preferred, according to the complaint, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Merchants are also not allowed to present other forms of payment earlier in the checkout process.
For example, the attorneys say that without PayPal’s anti-steering rules, a merchant could charge $5.83 for a box of Kleenex when PayPal is used as the payment method, and less than $5.83 when the consumer paid with credit card or other payment. Or, a merchant could maintain the same $5.83 price but provide consumers with a discount when they paid with a method other than PayPal or Venmo.
“Either way, the price differential would result in consumers paying lower all-in prices,” the lawsuit says.
Calling the policies “draconian” and “illegally anticompetitive,” the attorneys compared PayPal’s anti-steering rules to those that Visa and Mastercard used to impose before they were sued by the Department of Justice in 2010.
In a statement, the attorneys representing the class said: “Consumers end up paying more for all transactions as a result of PayPal’s policies and industry-high rates. PayPal generated total revenues in 2022 exceeding $27 billion, most of it coming from these fees.”
Per the firm’s lawsuit, more than 400 million consumers have PayPal accounts, including 75% of all Americans. Nearly 1 million U.S. e-commerce websites accept PayPal as a means of payment, and PayPal processes 41 million transactions daily.
“If consumers were allowed to see behind PayPal’s pricing veil, they would see a clear and distinct difference between using PayPal and Venmo to complete their transactions and using its competitors,” said Steve Berman, managing partner and co-founder of Hagens Berman. “For a service named for its friendliness, PayPal is far from consumer friendly.”
The story was updated post-publication with the following statement from PayPal: “PayPal continues to put our customers first in everything that we do, and we take this responsibility seriously. We are reviewing the filing and have no further information to share at this time.”

https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/05/ai-detection-bad-actors/,Want to detect bad actors? Look on the bright side,"“You will find that 99.9% of people in this world are actually really good. When they use your product, they use it for all the right reasons. But then once in a while when something bad happens, it also feels like one too many,” Airbnb’s director of Trust Product and Operations, Naba Banerjee, said onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023.
Banerjee knows what she is talking about: Not long before she joined Airbnb’s trust and safety team in 2020, the company had declared a ban on “party houses” and taken other measures after five people died at a Halloween party hosted at a house that was rented on the platform.
Since then, the executive has become a bit of a “party pooper,” in the words of a recent CNBC profile. “As the person in charge of Airbnb’s worldwide ban on parties,” the piece noted, “Naba Banerjee has spent more than three years figuring out how to battle party ‘collusion’ by users, flag ‘repeat party houses’ and, most of all, design an anti-party AI system.”
It is this AI element that I found particularly interesting to discuss on Disrupt’s Builders Stage with Banerjee and her fellow panelist, Remote CEO Job van der Voort. While Remote is growing fast, the vast majority of its users still behave exactly as expected. But even a company the size of Airbnb, it turns out, doesn’t have that much data on rule-breaking behavior.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Naba-Banerjee-Airbnb-and-Job-van-der-Voort-Remote-How-to-Build-Intelligent-Startup-Ops-that-Will-Scale-with-Your-Business-panel-at-TechCrunch-Disrupt-2023-by-E.-Slomonson-The-Photo-Group-for-TechCrunch.jpg?resize=1200,800",2023-10-05 18:14:42
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/05/uber-slow-on-algo-transparency/,"Uber still dragging its feet on algorithmic transparency, Dutch court finds","Uber has been found to have failed to comply with European Union algorithmic transparency requirements in a legal challenge brought by two drivers whose accounts were terminated by the ride-hailing giant, including with the use of automated account flags.
Uber also failed to convince the court to cap daily fines of €4,000 being imposed for ongoing non-compliance — which now exceed over half a million euros (€584,000).
The Amsterdam District Court found in favor of two of the drivers who are litigating over data access over what they couch as ‘robo-firings’. But the appeals court decided Uber had provided sufficient information to a third driver regarding the reasons why its algorithm flagged the account for potential fraud.
The drivers are suing Uber to obtain information they argue they are legally required to regarding significant automated decisions taken about them.
The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides both for a right for individuals not to be subject to solely automated decisions with a legal or significant impact and to receive information about such algorithmic decision-making, including receiving “meaningful information” about the logic involved; its significance; and envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.
The nub of the issue relates not to fraud and/or risk reviews purportedly carried out on flagged driver accounts by (human) Uber staff — but to the automated account flags themselves which triggered these reviews.
Back in April an appeals court in the Netherlands also found largely in favor of platform workers litigating against Uber and another ride-hailing platform, Ola, over data access rights related to alleged robo-firing — ruling the platforms cannot rely on trade secrets exemptions to deny drivers access to data about these sorts of AI-powered decisions.
Per the latest ruling, Uber sought to rehash a commercial secrets argument to argue against disclosing more data to drivers about the reasons why its AIs flagged their accounts. It also generally argues that its anti-fraud systems would not function if full details were provided to drivers about how they work.
In the case of two of the drivers who prevailed against Uber’s arguments the company was found not to have provided any information at all about the “exclusively” automated flags that triggered account reviews. Hence the finding of an ongoing breach of EU algorithmic transparency rules.
The judge further speculated Uber may be “deliberately” trying to withhold certain information because it does not want to give an insight into its business and revenue model.
In the case of the other driver, for whom the Court found — conversely — that Uber had provided “clear and, for the time being, sufficient information”, per the ruling, the company explained that the decision-making process which triggered the flag began with an automated rule that looked at (i) the number of cancelled rides for which this driver received a cancellation fee; (ii) the number of rides performed; and (iii) the ratio of the driver’s number of cancelled and performed rides in a given period.
“It was further explained that because [this driver] performed a disproportionate number of rides within a short period of time for which he received a cancellation fee the automated rule signalled potential cancellation fee fraud,” the court also wrote in the ruling [which is translated into English using machine translation].
The driver had sought more information from Uber, arguing the data it provided was still unclear or too brief and was not meaningful because he does not know where the line sits for Uber to label a driver as a fraudster.
However, in this case, the interim relief judge agreed with Uber that the ride-hailing giant did not have to provide this additional information because that would make “fraud with impunity to just below that ratio childishly easy”, as Uber put it.
The wider question of whether Uber was right to classify this driver (or the other two) as a fraudster has not been assessed at this point in the litigation.
The long-running litigation in the Netherlands looks to be working towards establishing where the line might lie in terms of how much information platforms that deploy algorithmic management on workers must provide them with on request under EU data protection rules vs how much ‘blackboxing’ of their AIs they can claim is necessary to fuzz details so that anti-fraud systems can’t be gamed via driver reverse engineering.
Reached for a response to the ruling, an Uber spokesperson sent TechCrunch this statement:
The ruling related to three drivers who lost access to their accounts a number of years ago due to very specific circumstances. At the time when these drivers’ accounts were flagged, they were reviewed by our Trust and Safety Teams, who are specially trained to spot the types of behaviour that could potentially impact rider safety. The Court confirmed that the review process was carried out by our human teams, which is standard practice when our systems spot potentially fraudulent behaviour.
The drivers in the legal challenge are being supposed by the data access rights advocacy organization, Worker Info Exchange (WIE), and by the App Drivers & Couriers union.
In a statement, Anton Ekker of Ekker law which is representing the drivers, said: “Drivers have been fighting for their right to information on automated deactivations for several years now. The Amsterdam Court of Appeal confirmed this right in its principled judgment of 4 April 2023. It is highly objectionable that Uber has so far refused to comply with the Court’s order. However, it is my belief that the principle of transparency will ultimately prevail.”
In a statement commenting on the ruling, James Farrar, director of WIE, added: “Whether it is the UK Supreme Court for worker rights or the Netherlands Court of Appeal for data protection rights, Uber habitually flouts the law and defies the orders of even the most senior courts. Uber drivers and couriers are exhausted by years of merciless algorithmic exploitation at work and grinding litigation to achieve some semblance of justice while government and local regulators sit back and do nothing to enforce the rules. Instead, the UK government is busy dismantling the few protections workers do have against automated decision making in the Data Protection and Digital Information Bill currently before Parliament. Similarly, the proposed EU Platform Work Directive will be a pointless paper tiger unless governments get serious about enforcing the rules.”","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-1142304853-a.jpg?resize=1200,675",2023-10-05 18:00:06
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/05/as-its-workers-strike-over-burnout-and-low-wages-kaiser-permanente-strikes-a-deal-to-use-an-ai-copilot-from-nabla/,"As its workers strike over burnout and low wages, Kaiser Permanente strikes a deal to use an AI Copilot from Nabla","Yesterday, 75,000 workers at healthcare giant Kaiser Permanente embarked on a three-day strike to protest understaffing, burnout and low wages — setting a record for the biggest healthcare strike to date in U.S. history. But timing is everything in medicine. While Kaiser Permanente works through terms with union reps, another interesting development has emerged: it has inked a deal with Nabla, the AI healthcare startup from Paris, to provide an AI assistant to doctors and other clinicians in its network to reduce the amount of time they spend on admin: the AI will help with writing up notes and doing other administrative work, based on conversations that it listens to and transcribes.
Nabla’s Copilot product, which was launched in March of this year, will be rolled out to Kaiser Permanente physicians in Northern California initially, covering 10,000 doctors in all. The service will be available to all of them, but using it will be optional. If the service proves to work well, the idea will be potentially to roll it out across the rest of Kaiser Permanente’s footprint in the U.S.
From what we understand, Nabla and Kaiser Permanente first ran a two-week pilot of the service in August of this year. The process of turning that into a commercial deal might have normally taken much longer, so it’s worth wondering if the current labor actions had a role to play in speeding that up.
Still, it’s worth making clear that for now, neither Nabla nor Kaiser Permanente are working on tools to take over the clinical work the doctors and others are doing.
That’s not to say that others are not. Corti, another AI healthcare startup, raised $60 million in funding to continue building out its technology: another assistant for clinicians, but one where the aim is to help them with their patient assessments. Corti has some impressive deals in place already, too, and it says that it’s already working with more than 100 million patients/year.
And there are other industries where AI has become a major point of contention with labor groups. In the world of entertainment, anticipating the growing use of AI to recreate human likeness and voices, the SAG-AFTRA actors union is striking right now over the very issue of AI and how it will impact how they work and how they are compensated.
The pain point that Nabla is addressing is that the admin that doctors and others are required to do after seeing patients — forms that are needed for compliance and other purposes — can take hours to get through each day.
“A doctor might make as many as 4,000 mouse clicks in a 10-hour shift,” Alexandre Lebrun, the CEO and founder of Nabla, said in an interview.
So most of the time, those clinicians will put off getting to it. As a result, that work stretch, and the work that’s done in that stretch, are often referred to as “pajama time,” a reference to how clinicians get to it typically at the end of the day, in their nightclothes. The burnout that results from these extra hours of work on top of work has been a persistent problem in the industry for years.
Nabla’s copilot, as we have described before, essentially works as a virtual assistant. It listens to conversations and other interactions that are taking place with patients and matches up what it hears with other supplementary documents. And then it translates the resulting data into different document-based endpoints — such as prescriptions, follow-up appointment letters, consultation summaries — which typically result from those meetings. Doctors in the pilot cut out 1.5 hours of admin time using Nabla’s Copilot, the company said.
When we first wrote about the service, it had been based around GPT-3, the large language model built by OpenAI, which is used to generate human text and is powering hundreds of applications. Since then, Copilot has upgraded to GPT-4, but it’s also largely running the majority of its services now on its own LLM, although Lebrun said that it does still use GPT-4 in some areas to verify the work of its own LLM.
“GPT-4 is still the gold standard,” he said. “Because it’s very accurate and powerful, we use it to process feedback to correct what we do.”
(Lebrun, who has a long and interesting background in the world of virtual assistants and natural language processing, is very much a founder to watch. His sold his first startup, VirtuOz, a “Siri for enterprise,” in 2013 to Nuance to spearhead its development of digital assistant technology for businesses. He then founded and eventually sold his next startup, Wit.ai, to Facebook, where he and his team then worked on the social network’s foray into chatbots in Messenger. He then helped establish and run FAIR, Facebook’s AI research centre in Paris, which is headed up by Yann LeCun, the Turing Award winner who is Meta’s chief scientist. LeCun is one of his advisers now at Nabla.)
Nabla has raised just under $23 million from investors that include Tony Fadell, Firstminute Capital and Artemis. From what we understand, it’s starting discussions now with investors to raise more.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1347476924.jpg?resize=1200,600",2023-10-05 16:42:43
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/05/rivian-evs-costly/,Rivian reminds investors that making EVs is incredibly expensive,"In 2023, the EV market is no longer about startups. Instead, the race to shift to electric vehicles has morphed into a competition between the world’s largest automotive companies and a host of smaller rivals that have gone public. The latter are often deeply unprofitable.
The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.

In fact, this set of smaller EV companies is bleeding so much cash that there’s a row going on at the moment between China and other economies over subsidies and fair competition.
Subsidies are just part of the issue, though. There’s lots of talk about how central China is to the global battery supply chain and if new laws could shake up the present dynamic. Much as food security has long been a priority for countries, joined by semiconductors in recent years, nations and economic blocs also want to ensure that their ability to manufacture green (or greener) technologies can meet their needs.
The stakes are more focused for EV companies simply trying to scale production and prove to investors that they are viable, long-term businesses. They need to scale manufacturing to sell more cars, which will in turn increase manufacturing and research cost efficiencies, and all that will hopefully snowball into a bottom line that’s not deep in the red all the time. So it makes sense that we often see high levels of spending, and massive losses, at EV companies that are ramping up production.
The New York Times recently reported that Nio, a Chinese EV company also listed in the U.S., is losing around $35,000 per car. It’s hardly alone in losing so much money. U.S.-based Rivian in August said it delivered 12,640 cars in the second quarter of 2023, which resulted in revenue of $1.12 billion, gross loss of $412 million, operating loss of $1.29 billion and a free cash flow deficit of $1.62 billion.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/05/annie-wu-henry-vivek-ramaswamy-tiktok-strategy-election/,'TikTok whisperer' Annie Wu Henry on social media and 2024,"‘TikTok whisperer’ Annie Wu Henry on social media and 2024 'There’s this level of like, Gen Z does not put up with bullshit.'
Connecting with the youth is a craft that has long eluded the Olds — a demographic that’s less defined by age than it is by social media habits. Politicians, historically, have not prioritized young voter outreach.
But in recent elections, the youth voter turnout cinched major wins for Democrats, and as the 2024 presidential election looms ahead, Republicans are still falling behind in their digital strategy. Age alone isn’t enough to convince 18- to 29-year-old voters, who overwhelmingly backed Democrats in the midterm elections, to show up to the polls.
Candidates are expected to be content creators as much as they are politicians. Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, for example, became a TikTok star over the course of his campaign. Between trolling his opponent Mehmet Oz and jumping on trending TikTok sounds, Fetterman’s apparent meme fluency was wildly popular with young voters.
Others, both on the left and on the right, fumbled their social media strategy with forced pop culture references and desperate attempts at being cool. They were dismissed as cringe, a branding worse than any scarlet letter.
Digital fluency doesn’t always come naturally to those who didn’t grow up online. Bad at posting? Hire a strategist.
Enter Annie Wu Henry, the digital strategist and “TikTok whisperer” behind Fetterman’s campaign. In an interview with TechCrunch, Henry explained what Vivek Ramaswamy did right, where it went downhill and why Gen Z just doesn’t put up with bullshit.
This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.
TC: So you worked with Fetterman — obviously, this makes you an expert on this. What was your first reaction when you saw Jake Paul endorsing Vivek Ramaswamy?
AWH: I think, at large, we’re going to see much more of that cultural play, if they’re doing it. A lot of the influencers that we look at as likely right-leaning, like Joe Rogan, are political entities. Joe Rogan’s podcast isn’t a “political podcast.” Andrew Tate, even, is not a political being. Obviously, everything’s political.
But these people are very much in the right-wing media, any kind of ecosystem of media that allows these ideologies to be perpetuated in a cultural and widespread way. If they were only to be spouted from politicians and people in politics, it wouldn’t have the same ability for reach.
I, for example, am a young woman of color. I am pretty politically active. I like what I keep up with, what music I listen to, et cetera, and I don’t get a lot of these things. For example, I didn’t know that Andrew Tate had a brother until way after that was out there. I try to avoid his content because I don’t want to get more, but I don’t get fed a lot of it because I think these platforms know that I am not the target demographic that’s likely to continue to be interested in that. However, I talk to my guy friends that are my age, or guys in their 20s, 30s, and people that are younger, even. That is all they’re fed, even if they don’t want to be seeing that type of stuff.
And so people like Jake Paul, I think, easily fall into that category. And because of his start on YouTube and particularly with young people, he’s right in that space that, if utilized by people on the right and politicians, has a potential to be really impactful.
Definitely. I just talked to a professor who researches political influencers and he was like, we’re seeing a whole class of influencers who are distinctly basing their entire platforms around social issues, and you’re seeing a separate class of creators who happen to be giving out endorsements. And the question is, who is the one who has more influence?
That is something I am so, so interested in doing more with in my work, because we have this class of political influencers on the left and on the right. And a lot of times, these people are really great vehicles to get out information, to get people to take action, to keep young people informed and engaged. It’s not necessarily exactly the same thing as watching C-SPAN every day, but it is getting in depth on a lot of these issues. It’s pretty consistent news.
And so that is really good to get the young people on these platforms educated. However, how we understand that these algorithms and For You Pages and things like that work, is that people have to show that they’re interested in receiving that information and interested in receiving that content.
And so if there is someone who, for example, is just really into sports, or just really into comedy, or is just really into whatever it might be, if they’re on these platforms enough and staying engaged and active in a natural way, they’re going to continue to be fed that content that they want and from people that they want. They’re not going to get some of the reports on the news on their For You Page because the algorithm, and these platforms, are going to say, “That’s not what this person is likely to engage with.”
So I think there is a lot of power, especially in the people who are maybe less political or apolitical or unengaged, to be impacted heavier when it’s from someone that is not a “political influencer.”
A lot of the time, it’s easier to get political influencers to be talking about these things. Because it’s what they care about and put their time and energy into. But it’s when these other people get political, and it doesn’t even have to be in large senses — it can be that they talk about an issue or something happening in the news that happens to have political undertones.
I think like, again, with Jake Paul, people aren’t thinking that they’re being fed political content, even though that ends up being the case, right?
So knowing the reach that Jake Paul has to people who, frankly, probably aren’t interested in politics — do you think that the Ramaswamy campaign picking Jake Paul specifically over some right-wing Twitch streamer was a calculated move? Because when I first saw it, I was like, “Well they probably don’t know anything about TikTok. Why would they pick Jake Paul?”
I mean, on the right, I think that some of the stuff they do is not on purpose.
That’s what I was wondering.
It’s not as purposely as smart as it sometimes is, right? I have looked at Vivek’s TikTok rollout and some of the things that he’s doing, whether on purpose or not, there is some good TikTok strategy behind it.
For example, a lot of Jake Paul’s TikTok following is probably non-political. I would assume his demographics are like, 12- to 25-year-old boys.
The endorsement did not really talk about the issues. It just said that he cares about young people, and he is going to be different, and that is what young people want out of politicians. Young people don’t trust systems, they don’t have super heavy loyalties to a political party.
His first TikTok, if you had it written down, and someone read it without it being about someone specific, is what young people want. It is someone who’s different, someone who’s not going to be a corrupt politician or is outside the system, is someone who understands your issues. A lot of his messaging is for how Gen Z wants to be spoken to, especially being on that platform.
However, I will caveat all of this by saying that as a candidate, this makes it tough to actually then be fully effective, because, I forgot what he called it, but he’s criticized TikTok…
He said it’s digital fentanyl or something like that.
Digital fentanyl from China or something like that. He wants to take away voting for people 18 to 25 unless they serve in the army or take a civics test. I am pro civics, but that is unlikely what he is envisioning. I think that it’s a form of voter suppression, as he wants it.
His attacks on young people then negate all of this perhaps accidental strategy that was good, right? That’s then why we see young people who are engaged and going to seek that out, and going to troll him and ratio him in the comments.
If you were to watch this video, and not know who it is and say, “He’s making some good points,” but then see that he’s being relentlessly trolled by young people, hopefully it will draw some questions.
In general, why the right has issues effectively communicating with Gen Z and effectively being up in these spaces, is because a lot of their messaging and stances are things that Gen Z overwhelmingly does not like.
Fetterman’s campaign is what every candidate trying to get that youth vote is trying to emulate. What is missing on the right?
I think it’s really hard for a lot of these people on the right, they’ll act in ways that go against things that they’ve said. Gen Z sees that, and if you know anything about that generation, they just don’t buy it.
That’s so much of what platforms like TikTok and Twitch cater to, and why they thrive on those platforms, because you can just pull out your phone and be talking while you’re getting ready with the worst angle possible…
I think it’s really hard, with Vivek as a key example, to say it’s digital fentanyl, and to be on the platform and be like, “I’m gonna be here because this is where you guys are at.” Like you want to get rid of this, so why are you really here? None of that can actually feel authentic.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Annie-Wu.png?resize=1200,800",2023-10-05 16:14:29

In an era when the term “general purpose” is tossed around with great abandon, however, it can be difficult for non-roboticists to understand what today’s systems can — and can’t — do. The truth of it is that most robots these days are built to do one (or a couple, if you’re lucky) thing really well.
It’s a truth that spans the industry, from the lowliest robot vacuum to the most advanced industrial system. So, how do we make the transition from single to general purpose robotics? Certainly, there are going to be a lot of stops in multipurpose land along the way.
The answer is, of course, robot learning. Walk into nearly any robotics research lab these days and you will find teams working on tackling the issue. The same applies to startups and corporations, as well. Look at companies Viam and Intrinsic, which are working to lower the bar of entry for robot programming.
Solutions run a fairly wide gamut at the moment, but it has become increasingly clear to me that this is an issue that won’t be taken down with a single silver bullet. Rather, building more complex and capable systems will almost certainly involve a combination of solutions. Central to most of these, however, is a need for a large, shared dataset.
Google’s DeepMind robotics team this week announced the work it has done with 33 research institutes designed to create a massive, shared database called Open X-Embodiment. The researchers behind the project liken it to ImageNet, a database of more than 14 million images that dates back to 2009.
“Just as ImageNet propelled computer vision research, we believe Open X-Embodiment can do the same to advance robotics,” note DeepMind researchers, Quan Vuong and Pannag Sanketi. “Building a dataset of diverse robot demonstrations is the key step to training a generalist model that can control many different types of robots, follow diverse instructions, perform basic reasoning about complex tasks and generalize effectively.”
They add that such a task is far too large to entrust to a single lab. The database features more than 500 skills and 150,000 tasks pulled from 22 different robot types. As the “Open” bit of the name implies, its creators are making the data available to the research community.
“We hope that open sourcing the data and providing safe but limited models will reduce barriers and accelerate research,” the team adds. “The future of robotics relies on enabling robots to learn from each other, and most importantly, allowing researchers to learn from one another.”","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/651af30828b793661831c1af_8NsrFNiIIPRMk4CzMdgcAKWkL9FEW96yiZrqUL8UGA5w5c02FEcXFHf0U3O6rCNbhxT11qWd-TnIMkE_Duhmpb5UtlGFwCzt_tppdxZxsFIaGjNrUFFYwKekc_tVA3OQfDIefvFEGBud0oQDncWJNEDyRBuCQ9Tv8Y8qz7hptdSfwGWVmOXD3jz1QhTNctE.png?resize=1200,674",2023-10-05 16:12:36
https://venturebeat.com/ai/streamingllm-shows-how-one-token-can-keep-ai-models-running-smoothly-indefinitely/,StreamingLLM keeps AI models running smoothly indefinitely,"VentureBeat presents: AI Unleashed - An exclusive executive event for enterprise data leaders. Network and learn with industry peers. Learn More
Text-to-text large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Meta’s Llama 2, Anthropic’s Claude 2 have been at the center of the current AI gold rush in Silicon Valley and the wider enterprise tech world — but by and large, all of them share some of the same issues.
One of these issues is consistently high quality performance over time during a single conversation with a user — where the LLM provides responses that are as helpful, fast, and relevant in the middle of the conversation and at the very end as it does at the beginning, no matter how long that conversation lasts or how many exchanges of dialog it encompasses. This is because LLMs are pre-trained on blocks of data, or sequences, of certain lengths — 4,000 tokens in the case of Llama 2 and many other leading LLMs.
Once a user inputs more tokens than this — even if they are doing so across multiple different prompts — the LLM begins to suffer reduced performance, that is, worse quality responses. This is not acceptable for enterprises looking to have LLMs helping customers or employees in an open-ended fashion.
A new paper published recently by researchers at Meta, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), finds that there is a simple way to help LLMs maintain their performance even for indefinitely long conversations, where the user’s prompts collectively add up to be longer than what the LLM was trained to handle at once.

Their work, a new framework for training and deploying LLM inferences dubbed “StreamingLLM,” reveals a number of important findings for other AI researchers and enterprises looking to use LLMs to aid with their business.
The problem StreamingLLM seeks to solve
As anyone who has interacted with a human customer support specialist or even an internal IT tech at your employer knows, it can often take a lengthy conversation and multiple messages exchanged between you and your assigned helper to solve the problem at hand.
But no matter whether you’re a customer or an employee — you want the person assigned to help you to be consistently responsive, informed, and helpful in their communications with you throughout your entire exchange. It can be very frustrating and counterproductive if suddenly, deep into the conversation where you’ve already spent time and energy explaining your issue, your helper begins responding with one-word answers, more slowly, or without giving you the information you need.
Although this can be an issue with some people who are distracted, unmotivated, or exhausted with the conversation, it is endemic for LLMs, as their performance suffers once a conversation with them goes beyond the length of the “context window,” the maximum number of tokens the LLM can respond to at once, and which was used to pre-train them. This is true even though most LLMs are designed to handle open-ended conversations that may go on for many lines.
Even if each of those lines fits within the context window of an LLM — and all of them should, as most LLMs have an upper boundary on the amount of text you can enter in for them to respond to in a single message — together, the cumulative sum of multiple messages in a single conversation adds up to a number of tokens that is larger than those included the LLM’s initial pre-training context window, which causes the LLM’s performance after this point to suffer.
It would be as though when you were talking to a human customer support agent, if once you said a certain number of words to them across a few sentences that added up to some limit unknown to you, they abruptly became stupider and less attentive.
The researchers behind the StreamingLLM framework summarize the problem in their paper as follows: “For example, an ideal ChatBot assistant can stably work over the content of recent day-long conversations. However, it is very challenging for LLM to generalize to longer sequence lengths than they have been pre-trained on.”
While it is possible to expand the length of the token sequences in pre-training LLMs, and already, a number of researchers have done this, it is not possible to account for how long a unique conversation with a given user will last.
So, how do you get an LLM with a fixed context-window length used in pre-training — however long that is — to be able to retain its performance once that length has been eclipsed over multiple messages?
The solution the researchers developed
The researchers developed an innovative solution for maintaining LLM performance once the amount of information in a conversation ballooned past the number of tokens used in the pre-training sequence.
What the researchers discovered was that LLMs pay closer attention to the tokens they are prompted with early on in a conversation or in training.
“A surprisingly large amount of attention score is allocated to the initial tokens,” they write. Why is this the case?
“Due to the sequential nature of autoregressive language modeling, initial tokens are visible to all subsequent tokens, while later tokens are only visible to a limited set of subsequent tokens,” they write. “As a result, initial tokens are more easily trained to serve as attention sinks, capturing unnecessary attention.”
In other words: whatever you put in front of an LLM first when conversing with it can and will be used by it later on in subsequent exchanges of prompt and output, but whatever you prompt it with later on will not necessarily be what the LLM chooses to focus on or reference in its responses.
Yet, the researchers discovered that if the user provides some of the initial tokens later in the conversation with an LLM, in subsequent responses, it’s enough to restore the LLMs performance back to near its peak.
Remember our human customer support analogy earlier? Imagine if, by saying four of the same magic words you said at the beginning of your conversation with them, you could suddenly get them to deliver high-quality responses with you even much later in the conversation.
The researchers dub these initial tokens that grab most of the LLM’s attention, fittingly, as “attention sinks,” and note that for most LLMs, “the introduction of four initial tokens, as attention sinks, suffices to restore the LLM’s performance…adding just one or two doesn’t achieve full recovery.”
By reintroducing attention sink tokens in every single subsequent prompt from a user, the researchers were able to maintain the performance of leading models including LLama 2 and Falcon 40B across prompts consisting of 4 million tokens (a 1000-fold increase from the original context window of just 4,000 tokens) “and potentially even more”, and increased its speed in subsequent responses by 22.2 times.
In other words, Streaming LLM “enables LLMs trained with a finite attention window to work on text of infinite length without finetuning.” Importantly — this “infinite” length text would still need to be delivered to the LLM in chunks limited to the size of its context window. However, it means the LLM could have a never-ending conversation with someone and retain its performance throughout (theoretically).
One token to rule them all (their attention, at least)
Taking their findings another step further, the researchers hypothesized and proved that you could actually get away with adding just a single special token to act as an “attention sink” for an LLM early on, and that, by reintroducing this token later manually or automatically (behind the scenes of a user-or-employee facing LLM), the LLM’s performance could continue to be kept high.
“Introducing a sink token is highly effective in stabilizing the attention mechanism,” the researchers explain. “Simply pairing this sink token with recent tokens sufficiently anchors the model’s performance…Given these findings, we recommend training future LLMs with a sink token in all samples to optimize streaming deployment.”
Asked what specific data should be used for an attention sink, one of the paper’s authors, Guangxuan Xiao of MIT, wrote to VentureBeat in an email that “the ‘attention sinks’ can be any initial tokens; the focus is more on their position than semantics…. These aren’t specific words or concepts; even tokens (e.g., linebreak “
”) without semantic meanings work effectively.”
As for what the researchers hope StreamingLLM will be used for, Xiao said: “We designed StreamingLLM for continuous applications, like multi-round dialogues. It’s perfect for use cases where a model must function non-stop without relying too heavily on past data. A daily assistant LLM exemplifies this. With our method, the model can persist, drawing from recent interactions, eliminating the need for frequent cache refreshes.”
However, the researchers are also clear to note the limitations of their work as well, and were careful to emphasize StreamingLLM does not extend the context window of LLMs, contrary to some hype on X (formerly Twitter) about their work. It also does not ensure that LLM will remember everything said at every point during the conversation.
“In fact, we neither expand the LLMs’ context window nor do we improve their long-term memory,” Xiao told VentureBeat.",https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cfr0z3n_a_waterfall_of_code_and_data_0763a90d-2214-4536-b4d7-5554cac56d24.png?w=1200&strip=all,2023-10-05 23:51:51

Network and learn with industry peers. Learn More
California-based Nucleus AI, a four-member startup with talent from Amazon and Samsung Research, today emerged from stealth with the launch of its first product: a 22-billion-parameter large language model (LLM).
Available under an open-source MIT license and commercial license, the general-purpose model sits between 13B and 34B segments and can be fine-tuned for different generation tasks and products. Nucleus says it outperforms models of comparable size and will eventually help the company build towards its goal of using AI for transforming agriculture.
“We’re starting with our 22-billion model, which is a transformer model. Then, in about two weeks’ time, we’ll be releasing our state-of-the-art RetNet models, which would give significant benefits in terms of costs and inference speeds,” Gnandeep Moturi, the CEO of the company, told VentureBeat.
The new Nucleus AI model
Nucleus started training the 22B model about three and a half months ago after receiving compute resources from an early investor.
Event AI Unleashed An exclusive invite-only evening of insights and networking, designed for senior enterprise executives overseeing data stacks and strategies. Learn More
The company tapped existing research and the open-source community to pre-train the LLM on a context length of 2,048 tokens and eventually trained it on a trillion tokens of data, covering large-scale deduplicated and cleaned information scraped from the web, Wikipedia, Stack Exchange, arXiv and code.
This established a well-rounded knowledge base for the model, covering general information to academic research and coding insights.
As the next step, Nucleus plans to release additional versions of the 22B model, trained on 350 billion tokens and 700 billion tokens, as well as two RetNet models – 3 billion parameters and 11 billion parameters – that have been pre-trained on the larger context length of 4,096 tokens.
These smaller-sized models will bring the best of RNN and transformer neural network architectures and deliver huge gains in terms of speed and costs. In internal experiments, Moturi said, they were found to be 15 times faster and required only a quarter of the GPU memory that comparable transformer models generally demand.
“So far, there’s only been research to prove that this could work. No one has actually built a model and released it to the public,” the CEO added.
Bigger ambitions
While the models will be available for enterprise applications, Nucleus has bigger ambitions with its AI research.
Instead of building straight-up chatbots like other LLM companies OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere, Moturi said they plan to leverage AI to build an intelligent operating system for agriculture, aimed at optimizing supply and demand and mitigating uncertainties for farmers.
“We have a marketplace-type of idea where demand and supply will be hyper-optimized for farmers in such a way that Uber does for taxi drivers,” he said.
This could solve multiple challenges for farmers, right from issues from climate change and lack of knowledge to optimizing supply and maintaining distribution.
“Right now, we’re not competing against anybody else’s algorithms. When we got access to compute, we were trying to build internal products to step into the farming landscape. But then we figured we need language models as the core of the marketplace itself and started building that with the contribution from the open-source community,” he added.
More details about the farming-centric OS and the RetNet models will be announced later this month.",https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cfr0z3n_aerial_view_of_a_farm_with_overlaid_glowing_UI_and_data_858fae5f-8d90-4c8a-8cb6-14c96d554b0f-1.png?w=1200&strip=all,2023-10-05 20:40:20

Underneath just about every generative AI application for training or inference today you’ll likely find Docker containers as the primary approach to deployment.
Today at the Dockercon conference in Los Angeles, Docker Inc., the eponymous company behind the open source docker container technology, is taking a dive into the deep end of AI with a series of initiatives designed to help developers more rapidly build generative AI applications.
Among the efforts is the launch of a new GenAI stack that integrates docker with the Neo4j graph database, LangChain model chaining technology and Ollama for running large language models (LLMs). The new Docker AI product is also debuting at Dockercon, as an integrated way for developers to get AI powered insights and direction for development with containers.
The critical importance of Docker to the modern development ecosystem cannot be overstated, and the new AI efforts could have a big impact on GenAI development efforts. Docker has doubled down on its developer focus in recent years, which is an effort the company’s CEO said is paying off.

“For four years running, Stack Overflow’s community of developers has voted us number one most wanted, number one most loved developer tool,” Docker CEO, Scott Johnston told VentureBeat. “And we’re now up to 20 million monthly active developers from all around the world.”

What the Docker GenAI stack brings to developers
While the use of Docker containers to help share and deploy AI is pervasive, Johnston said that there is also a need to make development of GenAI applications easier.
GenAI applications all typically require a few core elements, such as a vector database, which is something that Neo4j now has as part of its graph database platform. Then of course GenAI requires an LLM, which is what Ollama provides with its platform that enables users to run LLMs including Llama 2, to run locally. Modern GenAI applications are also commonly multi-step, which is where LangChain fits in with its framework. Getting all those different pieces configured in containers to work together normally would require a bit of effort that can now be significantly simplified with the GenAI stack.
The Docker GenAI stack is designed to help developers and the enterprises they work for to more easily get started with AI development using containers. With the GenAI stack there are several use cases that are being targeted including the ability to build a support agent bot with a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) capability, a python coding assistant and automated content generation.
“It’s pre configured, it’s ready to go and they [developers] can start coding and experimenting to help get the ball rolling,” Johnston said.
The whole stack is designed so it can run locally on a developer system and is being made freely available. As developers build out applications and need deployment and commercial support, Johnston said that there will be options available from Docker and its partners.
Docker AI: a ‘mech suit’ for developers
There is no shortage of GenAI developer tools in the market today, with popular options such as GitHub Copilot and Amazon CodeWhisper among others.
Docker is now entering that fray with its own GenAI tool, simply called Docker AI. Rather than referring to Docker AI as a copilot, which is a term that Microsoft and other vendors are increasingly using for GenAI tools that assist users, Docker is using the term- mech suit. The basic idea is that with the mech suit, developers have more power and strength to accomplish tasks.
Docker AI has been trained on Docker’s proprietary data from millions of Dockerfiles, compose files, and error logs. Docker AI integrates directly into developers’ workflows to provide assistance when errors occur. It will display potential fixes within the development environment and allow developers to test the fix before committing changes. The goal is to create a better experience for developers to troubleshoot and fix issues when they arise.
Johsnton noted that while tools like Github Copilot are useful and powerful, Docker AI is specifically tuned to help enable container development.
“It has been trained on a rich proprietary stream of Docker data that other LLMs don’t have access to,” he said.",https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-04-at-5.20.26-PM.png?w=1200&strip=all,2023-10-05 19:18:16

San Mateo-based Observe, a startup working to accelerate application troubleshooting and incident resolution with a unified observability cloud, today announced it has raised $50 million in series A3 debt financing, led by Sutter Hill Ventures. The company also debuted the latest version of its platform ‘Hubble’ with new generative AI smarts.
According to Observe, the release brings a revamped interface and gives users generative tools to help with things like product support, coding, RegEx generation, and incident workflows. It can improve the productivity of users of the platform by up to 25%, the company said.
The funding and update come at a time when enterprises are racing to adopt observability solutions that can actively monitor and flag potential software issues, giving them the necessary insights to fix the incident and prevent downtimes (and the associated cost overheads).
According to Future Market Insights, the market for these solutions is expected to grow from $2.17 billion in 2022 to $5.55 billion by 2032, with a CAGR of over 8%.

Observe’s ‘unified cloud’ for observability
Most enterprise technology stacks today are a web of complex and distributed applications that run aggressively and generate an exponential amount of telemetry spanning logs, metrics and traces.
These data points usually remain siloed, requiring teams to use different tools to put everything together with context and correlations and identify potential incidents.
This takes time and is not suitable, especially at a time when the application surface is constantly growing.
Observe — founded in 2017 by executives from Snowflake, Splunk, Wavefront and Roblox — solves this challenge by offering a unified Observability cloud that brings all the data to one place, allowing for faster troubleshooting, incident detection and resolution.
“Observe puts all data in a single, low-cost Data Lake (built on Snowflake) and eliminates silos for logs, metrics and traces. By storing all data in one place, Observe is able to compress data 10x and store it for 13 months, resulting in inexpensive long-term storage,” Jeremy Burton, the CEO of the company, told VentureBeat.
Once the information is ingested in the data lake, it is curated to form a “data graph” that enables analysis of the information and provides users with relevant context to quickly identify and resolve incidents.
Since its launch, Observe has netted around 60 paying customers, including TopGolf, Edgio, Linedata and Auditboard. Burton also noted that the company’s annual contract value has more than doubled every year since it started selling and the current year is expected to continue that trend.
Standing out with generative AI smarts
While Observe claims to solve a major issue for enterprises, it is not the only one in this space. Well-funded players like Datadog, Dynatrace, New Relic, Grafana and Splunk (recently acquired by Cisco) are also targeting the observability problem with their respective APM and log analytics solutions and introducing new features to gain share in the market.
On its part, Observe claims to be the only one that eliminates silos of logs, metrics and traces by storing everything in a single, low-cost data lake. To further stand out, the company is pushing out the Hubble update which revamps its Explorer interface for logs, metrics and traces and adds new generative AI features.
This includes an in-product chatbot assistant that responds to queries about Observe’s capabilities, ‘how-to’ tasks or error messages as well as a RegEx generation tool that parses data to add structure to logs on the fly.
O11Y GPT help in Observe
Beyond this, the interface will also include a co-pilot to generate the OPAL code – Observe’s query language – in response to natural language inputs, a dedicated assistant for troubleshooting via Slack and a new ‘live’ mode enabling data to be queried in 20 seconds or less from the time it was created.
“Hubble also features improved scalability and performance. With this launch, Observe is now capable of ingesting over one petabyte of data per day into a single instance,” Burton said. He added that the funding from this round will help the company grow its sales team to meet the accelerating demand for a modern approach to observability.

BOSTON & SAN FRANCISCO–(BUSINESS WIRE)–October 5, 2023–
Battery Ventures, the global, technology-focused investment firm that backs cloud companies, today revealed its sixth-ever rankings of the 25 Highest-Rated Public Cloud-Computing Companies and 25 Highest-Rated Private Cloud-Computing Companies to Work For, based on data specifically provided by Glassdoor*.
The lists recognize the U.S.-based cloud companies – spanning industries including security, cloud storage, financial software, customer experience, data governance, marketing and advertising technology and more – with the highest levels of employee satisfaction, as self-reported by employees on Glassdoor, an online provider of insights about jobs and companies. This year, Cribl, which creates observability and data-pipeline software, topped the private-company rankings while cybersecurity company SentinelOne took the #1 spot among public companies.
Receiving kudos from employees on culture and workplace dynamics was particularly notable for this year’s winners considering the still-challenging market environment for technology companies. Indeed, many tech companies have been tightening their belts and shifting away from “growth at all costs” business models in favor of more-disciplined growth plans, some of which have targeted employee perks.
“The companies on this year’s Highest-Rated Cloud-Computing Companies to Work For list have managed to create and preserve stellar corporate cultures during a very tumultuous time -and also as traditional workplace norms, like working in the office, have dramatically shifted post-Covid,” said Neeraj Agrawal, a cloud-computing investor and Battery general partner. “Cultivating employee happiness and satisfaction is more challenging than ever, so we commend this year’s winners for their efforts.”
According to the results of a Battery survey of the winning private companies, many companies said they prioritized the development of inclusive company cultures and open communication to employees, including through employee engagement surveys, regular town hall meetings and monthly ask me anything (AMA) format meetings with executive staff.
Many of these companies also offer highly competitive benefits packages and flexible working arrangements, along with regular opportunities to gather and collaborate with colleagues in person, according to employee comments in online Glassdoor reviews. Sixty-eight percent of the top public companies have their headquarters in California, compared to a whopping 76% of the top private companies.
In addition, employees at many of the highest-rated private companies enjoy ample support from their workplaces in areas including education and professional-development stipends, fertility assistance and even on-site childcare, in addition to generous paid time off, mental health and wellness/perk stipends, according to Battery’s survey of the top private companies.
“Company culture is pivotal for attracting elite talent and sustaining a competitive edge in the marketplace, and its significance becomes even more pronounced in challenging economic times. We hope that all companies featured on this list will take pride in this well-deserved recognition,” added Brandon Gleklen, a Battery principal.
At top-ranked company Cribl, employees reported on Glassdoor that they appreciate its transparent and accountable leadership culture.

https://venturebeat.com/ai/atropos-health-leverages-ai-to-democratize-access-to-real-world-evidence-in-healthcare/,Atropos Health leverages AI to democratize access to real-world evidence in healthcare,"VentureBeat presents: AI Unleashed - An exclusive executive event for enterprise data leaders. Network and learn with industry peers. Learn More
Atropos Health, the Palo Alto, Calif.-based healthcare startup, unveiled today a new artificial intelligence (AI) system that could revolutionize how evidence is produced to inform medical decisions and research.
The startup’s Geneva Operating System (OS) leverages natural language processing and generative AI to rapidly query real-world clinical data. This allows users without technical skills to get publication-quality results in minutes versus the traditional timeline of 8 weeks to 6 months.
The new system also includes a chatbot interface called ChatRWD where users simply type plain-language questions. The AI then suggests ways to refine the query, selects appropriate data sources from the company’s network of 160 million de-identified patient records, runs the analysis using rigorous statistical methods, and formats the results into an observational study report.
The company’s mission is extremely ambitious: “We want to inform every clinical treatment decision and research inquiry with personalized real world evidence globally,” said Brigham Hyde, Ph.D., co-founder and CEO of Atropos Health, in an interview with VentureBeat. The launch of both products is a significant step towards the personalization of healthcare, a field that has been increasingly relying on AI and machine learning solutions.

Hyde further explained that Geneva OS and ChatRWD are designed to provide healthcare professionals with quick, consistent, and reliable access to extensive real-world data. The platform currently includes 160 million patient records across various datasets, offering a rich repository of information.
“Healthcare is complicated, and hard [to navigate] in our country, let alone others. The way I see Geneva being used is as an important layer to the data ecosystem, ensuring consistency and speed out of the data layer,” Hyde said.
Informing every clinical decision with AI-powered real world evidence
Atropos Health’s new solutions are expected to significantly improve the user experience for physicians and researchers. The company has reported an impressive Net Promoter Score (NPS) in the 40s for the product suite. “People who order one from us go on to order dozens of these things,” Hyde said, emphasizing that the speed and ease of use are unmatched. He explained, “That’s because the user experience is great.”
Atropos Health also offers users ultimate control over their data usage. Partners can choose whether to offer their data on the network and receive compensation when their data is used. They retain control over who uses it and for what purposes, making it an attractive proposition for healthcare institutions and data partners.
The company’s integrative approach could significantly improve patient outcomes, reduce the cost of care, and enhance care delivery, as supported by a ROI study published earlier this year. Hyde points out, “We don’t have to wait years to get evidence for care — because we have all this data that’s emerged.”
The launch of Geneva OS and ChatRWD could mark a pivotal moment in the healthcare industry, offering a new paradigm of evidence-based, personalized patient care. As the demand for such solutions continues to grow, Atropos Health is well-positioned to become a leading player in the health tech sector.
However, as the company expands its evidence network and forms new partnerships, the challenges of managing and integrating vast amounts of data from various sources cannot be underestimated. The potential of these new technologies also raises important questions about data privacy and security, as well as the ethical implications of AI in healthcare.
Nonetheless, the future looks bright according to Hyde, who reaffirms, “There is not enough evidence being used for medical care. There’s reasons for that, good and bad. We want more clinical trials, for sure. But we don’t have enough, and most of them exclude most patients, and we shouldn’t have to wait years to get evidence for care.” His words underscore Atropos Health’s commitment to accelerating evidence generation in healthcare.
As Atropos Health continues its journey, the potential for AI to revolutionize healthcare has never been clearer. The company’s innovative approach to evidence generation could soon become an essential tool for medical professionals worldwide, making personalized, data-driven care a reality for millions of patients.",https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/nuneybits_Abstract_healthcare_icons_and_simple_geometric_shapes_893a6fb1-c9ee-4595-842d-3286cfc437ca-transformed.png?w=1200&strip=all,2023-10-05 13:00:00
