https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-vulnerability-virtual-reality.html,Vulnerability in virtual reality systems identified,"Virtual reality (VR) systems have become popular for their ability to transport users into immersive virtual worlds. However, a team of computer scientists from the University of Chicago has discovered a potential vulnerability in these systems that could be exploited by hackers. They have named this vulnerability an ""inception layer"" and have presented their findings in a paper on the arXiv preprint server.

The concept behind the inception layer involves inserting an additional layer between the user's VR Home Screen and their VR User/Server. This layer, when installed on a user's VR headset, can deceive users into unknowingly revealing sensitive information to hackers. The researchers envision a scenario where hackers could manipulate users into entering passcodes, alter financial information, or gain access to personal secrets by adding deceptive elements to the virtual reality experience.

The name ""inception layer"" is inspired by the movie Inception, where the main character experiences an altered reality. Similarly, this layer would create a modified version of the virtual world that users normally see, allowing hackers to monitor and manipulate various aspects of the user's interactions. This includes gestures, voice commands, browsing activities, and social or business interactions.

To demonstrate this vulnerability, the research team conducted an experiment using 28 volunteers who played a game on a demonstration VR headset. They downloaded an app onto the devices, simulating a hacking scenario, and asked the volunteers if they had noticed anything unusual. While only 10 of the volunteers noticed a slight flickering during the download and activation process, only one of them questioned the possibility of something malicious happening.

The team promptly informed Meta, the company behind the Meta Quest VR system used in the experiment, about their findings. Meta has expressed their intention to investigate and address the potential vulnerability if confirmed. The researchers emphasize that similar vulnerabilities may exist in other VR systems and applications that attempt to insert themselves between users and their VR devices.

In conclusion, this research sheds light on the potential risks associated with VR systems and the need for robust security measures. The concept of an inception layer highlights the importance of ensuring the integrity and safety of virtual reality experiences. As the popularity of VR continues to grow, it is crucial for developers and manufacturers to address and mitigate such vulnerabilities to protect users from potential exploitation.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/uzbekistan-unicorn-uzum-series-a-funding/,Meet Uzbekistan's first unicorn: e-commerce startup Uzum,"Uzum, a startup based in Uzbekistan, has recently secured $114 million in funding, making it the country's first unicorn with a valuation of $1.16 billion. The startup offers online shopping, fintech, and food delivery services to millions of customers in Uzbekistan. This success can be attributed to several factors, including the country's young population, high literacy rate, and widespread internet and smartphone usage. However, despite these favorable conditions, the e-commerce sector in Uzbekistan remains underdeveloped, accounting for only 2.2% of the total retail market.

Uzum's co-founder and CEO, Djasur Djumaev, recognized the potential for a company to fill this gap in the market and provide a comprehensive online shopping experience. Uzum started by setting up its logistics, establishing pickup points, and offering next-day deliveries. Since its launch in October 2022, the platform has gained over 8 million monthly active users and has more than 9,000 merchants selling over 600,000 products. In comparison, the largest street bazaar in the country offers around 70,000 products on any given day. Uzum recorded a gross merchandise value (GMV) of $150 million in its first year of operations and expects to reach at least $300 million in run-rate GMV this year.

In addition to its success in e-commerce, Uzum has also ventured into fintech with a buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) product. Approximately 45% to 50% of e-commerce transactions on the platform are done through the BNPL solution. Uzum has also entered the food delivery business and established a digital bank to support its growth. By attracting customers through e-commerce, Uzum aims to retain them through high-transaction businesses like daily banking and monetize them through lending and credit products.

To support its expansion plans, Uzum recently raised $114 million in a Series A funding round led by FinSight Ventures. The funding will be used to further develop its fintech business and e-commerce arm. Uzum plans to launch new products for unsecured lending to individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as invest in its IT and logistics infrastructure. The startup also intends to raise an additional $200 million in a Series B round this year.

By the end of the year, Uzum plans to consolidate all its businesses into two super apps: one for consumer-focused offerings and another for business-focused products. It also has plans to launch the country's largest logistics complex for e-commerce in June. This complex is initially planned to span 112,000 square meters and will be expanded to over 500,000 square meters in the coming years.

While Uzum faces some global competition from companies like Nubank in Latin America and Kaspi.kz in Kazakhstan, it currently enjoys a favorable position in the Uzbekistan market. The startup can leverage its different margins across products and offer combined e-commerce and fintech services to generate higher profits. With the necessary talent, resources, and products, Uzum aims to become a national tech leader in Uzbekistan.

Overall, Uzum's success as Uzbekistan's first unicorn highlights the untapped potential in the country's e-commerce market. With its comprehensive online shopping platform and expansion plans in fintech, Uzum is well-positioned to capitalize on this market opportunity and become a leading tech company in Uzbekistan.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/uzum-logistics.jpg?w=1200,2024-03-26 05:00:18,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/christianmiller/2024/03/25/getting-more-impatient-when-the-end-is-in-sight-taylor-swifts-new-album-covid-vaccines-and-the-2020-presidential-election/,Getting More Impatient When the End Is in Sight,"Are you eagerly anticipating the release of Taylor Swift's new album, The Tortured Poets Department? With the release date approaching, you may be wondering if your impatience is increasing, decreasing, or staying the same. While all three options make sense, a recent study by Annabelle Roberts and Ayelet Fishbach reveals an interesting finding.

According to their research, people tend to experience greater impatience as they near the end of their wait. However, this impatience is not solely due to the time and energy invested in waiting. Instead, it is driven by a desire for closure in that particular area of their lives.

Roberts and Fishbach conducted several studies to support their findings. One study focused on the COVID-19 pandemic and the release of vaccines in the United States. Participants were surveyed at three different times, and their impatience levels were measured regarding getting a coronavirus vaccine and the end of the pandemic. The results showed that impatience for the vaccine increased over time, while impatience for the pandemic to end remained relatively stable. This suggests that impatience rises as the end of the wait draws near, regardless of the duration of the wait itself.

Another study examined the impatience of participants leading up to the 2020 U.S. presidential election between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Participants were surveyed during the days preceding Election Day, and the results showed a consistent increase in impatience as the election drew closer. This finding applied to both Biden and Trump supporters, highlighting a shared desire for closure in the election.

Further studies conducted by Roberts and Fishbach explored impatience in various scenarios, including waiting for a bus, receiving a package, tracking a delivery truck, and waiting in a traffic delay. In each case, impatience increased as the remaining time decreased. The research suggests that the amount of time already waited is less relevant than the time remaining until the anticipated event.

These findings have practical implications for situations where delays are inevitable. Roberts and Fishbach suggest that those in charge, such as government officials, nurses, or customer service representatives, should inform people about delays earlier in the wait and overestimate, rather than underestimate, the wait time. This proactive approach can help manage people's impatience and dissatisfaction.

For Swifties eagerly awaiting the release of Taylor Swift's new album, you can expect your impatience to grow as the days pass until April 19th, the album's release date. Planning ahead with activities like reading or listening to podcasts can help alleviate the surge in impatience and make the wait more bearable.

So hang in there, Swifties! The wait will soon be over, and you will finally find closure with the arrival of The Tortured Poets Department.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65f253e5f8f81a9d16371132/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1350,759,x0,y0,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 20:53:11,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-household-robots-common.html,Engineering household robots to have a little common sense,"Robots are becoming increasingly skilled at performing household tasks, from cleaning up spills to serving food. Many of these robots learn through imitation, where they copy the motions of a human guiding them. However, robots often struggle to adapt to unexpected bumps or nudges unless explicitly programmed to do so. To address this issue, MIT engineers have developed a method that combines robot motion data with the ""common sense knowledge"" of large language models (LLMs). This approach allows robots to break down tasks into subtasks and adjust to disruptions within a subtask, enabling them to continue without starting from scratch. The researchers will present their findings at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024) in May.

Typically, engineers guide a robot through the motions of a task, such as scooping marbles from one bowl and pouring them into another, to teach it how to perform the task. However, the robot relies on one continuous trajectory, which can lead to errors accumulating and derailing the execution. The MIT team realized that tasks consist of sequences of subtasks. For example, in the case of scooping marbles, the robot must first reach into the bowl, then scoop up the marbles, and finally move to the empty bowl. If a mistake occurs during any of these subtasks, the robot must start from the beginning unless engineers explicitly label each subtask and program or collect new demonstrations for the robot to recover from the failure.

To automate this process, the researchers turned to LLMs, which are deep learning models that process large amounts of text to establish connections between words, sentences, and paragraphs. They found that LLMs can generate logical lists of subtasks based on the text they have learned. By querying an LLM about the actions involved in a task, it can produce a sequence of verbs that describe the subtasks. For example, when asked about scooping marbles, an LLM might generate the verbs ""reach,"" ""scoop,"" ""transport,"" and ""pour.""

The researchers developed an algorithm that connects the LLM's natural language labels for subtasks with the robot's physical position or an image that represents the robot's state. This process, known as ""grounding,"" allows the robot to understand its stage in a task and replan or recover on its own. By mapping the robot's physical coordinates or image to the natural language labels, the algorithm enables the robot to self-correct and improve overall task success.

This new approach has the potential to enhance the capabilities of household robots. Instead of relying solely on human demonstrations, robots can leverage the knowledge of LLMs to adapt to disruptions and errors. The method streamlines the process of teaching robots new tasks and reduces the need for explicit programming for every possible failure scenario. The researchers' work paves the way for more intelligent and adaptable robots that can handle real-world situations with greater ease.

In conclusion, MIT engineers have developed a method that combines robot motion data with the knowledge of large language models to enable robots to adapt to disruptions and errors during tasks. By breaking down tasks into subtasks and leveraging the capabilities of language models, robots can self-correct and improve overall task success. This approach enhances the capabilities of household robots and reduces the need for explicit programming for every possible failure scenario. The researchers' work represents a significant step towards more intelligent and adaptable robots that can handle real-world situations effectively.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/engineering-household.jpg,2024-03-25 09:48:20,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.zdnet.com/article/five-linux-file-and-folder-management-commands-you-need-to-know/,Five Linux file and folder management commands you need to know,"Linux Commands for File and Folder Management

Linux is a powerful operating system with a wide range of commands that can be used to perform various tasks. When it comes to file and folder management, there are several essential commands that every Linux user should know. In this article, we will explore five more commands that can help you navigate and manipulate files and folders in Linux.

1. mkdir - Make a Directory

The `mkdir` command is used to create a new directory, also known as a folder. To create a new directory, simply use the following command:

```
mkdir FOLDER
```

Replace `FOLDER` with the desired name of the directory. For example, if you want to create a directory named ""TEST"" in the current working directory, you can run the following command:

```
mkdir TEST
```

If you want to create a directory inside another directory that doesn't exist yet, you can use the `-p` option. For example, to create a directory named ""project1"" inside the ""TEST"" directory, you can run the following command:

```
mkdir -p TEST/project1
```

This command will create the ""TEST"" directory if it doesn't exist and then create the ""project1"" directory inside it.

2. less - View File Contents

The `less` command is used to view the contents of a file. It allows you to scroll through the file and view it line by line. To view the contents of a file, use the following command:

```
less FILENAME
```

Replace `FILENAME` with the path to the file you want to view. For example, to view the contents of the ""/etc/samba/smb.conf"" file, you can run the following command:

```
less /etc/samba/smb.conf
```

The `less` command is particularly useful when you don't need to edit the file and only want to view its contents.

3. cat - Concatenate Files

The `cat` command is used to concatenate files and display their contents in the terminal. It is also commonly used to create, view, and append file contents. To view the contents of a file, use the following command:

```
cat FILENAME
```

For example, to view the contents of the ""/etc/fstab"" file, you can run the following command:

```
cat /etc/fstab
```

If you want to append the contents of one file to another, you can use the following command:

```
cat FILE1 >> FILE2
```

Replace `FILE1` with the path to the file whose contents you want to append and `FILE2` with the path to the file where you want to append the contents. For example, to append the contents of ""file1.txt"" to the end of ""file2.txt"" in the ""TEST/project1"" directory, you can run the following command:

```
cat TEST/project1/file1.txt >> TEST/project1/file2.txt
```

4. touch - Create Empty Files

The `touch` command is used to create empty files or update file timestamps. To create an empty file, use the following command:

```
touch FILENAME
```

Replace `FILENAME` with the desired name of the file. For example, to create an empty file named ""test"" in your home directory, you can run the following command:

```
touch ~/test
```

By default, the `touch` command updates the timestamps of existing files. However, most users employ it to create empty files.

5. pwd - Print Working Directory

The `pwd` command is used to print the name of the current working directory. It is helpful when you need to know the directory you are currently in. To use the `pwd` command, simply run the following command:

```
pwd
```

This will display the full path of the current working directory. For example, if you are in the ""/var/www/html/site1"" directory, running the `pwd` command will output ""/var/www/html/site1"".

In conclusion, these five commands - `mkdir`, `less`, `cat`, `touch`, and `pwd` - are essential for managing files and folders in Linux. By mastering these commands, you will be able to create directories, view file contents, concatenate files, create empty files, and navigate through the Linux filesystem with ease. Combine these commands with the previously mentioned five commands, and you will have a solid foundation for working with files and folders in Linux.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/73a6f654a7f5dd5cfc8e3389ab98f6a3dc1aafce/2024/03/25/49237a5b-9c57-4f0a-b810-21a85165bfeb/5penguinsflyinggettyimages-520459992.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-semiconductors-scale-processor-remarkable-speedup.html,Semiconductors at scale: New processor achieves remarkable speedup in problem solving,"Annealing processors are a specialized type of technology designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems. These processors have important implications for various practical applications, including logistics, resource allocation, and drug and material discovery. In a recent study published in IEEE Access, Professor Takayuki Kawahara and his team from Tokyo University of Science developed a scalable annealing processor that divides calculations into multiple LSI chips.

The researchers aimed to achieve advanced information processing directly at the edge, rather than relying on cloud computing or performing preprocessing at the edge for the cloud. The team utilized a unique processing architecture introduced by Tokyo University of Science in 2020, which involved creating a fully coupled LSI on a single chip using 28nm CMOS technology. They also devised a scalable method using parallel-operating chips and demonstrated its feasibility using FPGAs in 2022.

To create the scalable annealing processor, the team utilized 36 22nm CMOS calculation LSI chips and one control FPGA. This technology enables the construction of large-scale, fully coupled semiconductor systems based on the Ising model, with 4096 spins. The processor incorporates two key technologies developed at Tokyo University of Science: the ""spin thread method,"" which enables 8 parallel solution searches, and a technique that reduces chip requirements by about half compared to conventional methods. The processor operates at 10MHz with a power consumption of 2.9W (1.3W for the core part) and has demonstrated superior power performance compared to simulating a fully coupled Ising system on a PC or using core CPUs and arithmetic chips.

The successful machine verification of this processor opens up possibilities for enhanced capacity. Professor Kawahara envisions the social implementation of this technology through initiatives like joint research, technology transfer, and even starting a business. The team aims to develop this technology further, targeting an LSI system with computing power equivalent to a 2050-level quantum computer for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Their goal is to achieve this without the need for air conditioning, large equipment, or cloud infrastructure, using current semiconductor processes. By 2030, they hope to achieve 2 million spins and explore the creation of new digital industries using this technology.

In conclusion, the researchers at Tokyo University of Science have made significant progress in the development of a scalable, fully coupled annealing processor. By incorporating innovative technologies, such as chip reduction and parallel operations for simultaneous solution searches, they have achieved a processor with 4096 spins on a single board using 36 CMOS chips.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/03/25/3-motivations-behind-cosplaying-according-to-a-psychologist/,"3 Motivations Behind ‘Cosplaying,’ According To A Psychologist","Cosplay: Embracing Self-Expression, Escaping Reality, and Building a Community

If you've ever donned a costume for Halloween, you know the thrill of becoming someone else, even if it's just for a night. But for some, dressing up goes far beyond an annual celebration. Welcome to the world of cosplay, a vibrant subculture where individuals transform themselves into beloved characters from various media forms, such as comic books, anime, movies, and video games. Cosplay, short for ""costume play,"" is not just a once-a-year event but a regular passion and art form.

Cosplayers immerse themselves in the worlds of their favorite franchises, meticulously recreating costumes, hairstyles, makeup, and accessories to achieve accuracy and authenticity. It's not just about the physical appearance, though. Cosplaying also involves embodying the personality, mannerisms, and unique traits of the character being portrayed.

Research has shed light on why people engage in cosplay, revealing three compelling reasons behind this phenomenon:

1. Creative Self-Expression: 
Studies have shown that authentic self-expression leads to greater life satisfaction. Cosplaying provides an outlet for creative expression, allowing individuals to celebrate their favorite fandoms and express their passion for fictional characters and stories. For many cosplayers, it's a way to explore different facets of their identity. By embodying different characters, they can experiment with personas and aspects of themselves that they may not feel comfortable expressing in their everyday lives.

A study published in the journal Fashion Theory in 2015 examined the cosplay subculture in Hong Kong and found that the ability to shift identities is a key motivator for cosplayers. It allows them to create an exciting, extraordinary, and contented self, even if only temporarily. Cosplaying offers a transformation from an ordinary person to a superhero, from a game player to a performer, and from adulthood to childhood. It's a chance to recapture a sense of innocent nostalgia.

2. Escaping Reality:
In a world filled with stress and uncertainty, stepping into the shoes of a beloved character offers a temporary escape from reality. Cosplayers transcend the confines of their everyday lives and relish the opportunity to become anyone or anything they desire. According to a 2018 study, one of the strongest motivations for engaging in cosplay is the desire to escape from the monotony of daily life. By immersing themselves in fantastical worlds, cosplayers experience adventure, excitement, wonder, and even popularity that might be lacking in their mundane routines.

Cosplay provides young people with dreams, pleasures, romances, and fantasies that cannot be fulfilled in their daily lives. It allows participants to feel like stars or celebrities, even if only for a short moment. Many cosplayers see it as more than just a hobby; it's a form of performance and exhibition. They crave recognition, photographs, and admiration, as it fulfills their need to be seen and appreciated.

3. A Sense of Community:
Apart from the desire to escape reality, a strong sense of belongingness is another significant motivator for cosplayers. Cosplay creates a community where like-minded individuals can come together, share their passion, and form lasting friendships. Conventions and gatherings serve as communal spaces where cosplayers can connect with others who understand their love for the art form.

Research from the same 2018 study mentioned earlier highlights the importance of this sense of community. Cosplayers find solace and fulfillment in being part of a group that embraces their shared interests. It satisfies their fundamental need to belong, fostering a supportive and accepting environment where they can freely express themselves.

In conclusion, cosplay offers a unique and fulfilling experience for those who engage in it. It allows individuals to express their creativity, escape from reality, and find a sense of belonging within a vibrant community. By transforming into beloved characters, cosplayers not only become the best version of themselves but also celebrate the art of storytelling and imagination. So, the next time you see someone in an elaborate costume, remember that cosplay is more than just dressing up—it's a way of life.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6601ac3a0b7231e5ced958f7/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2613,1224,x0,y80,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 19:30:41,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-method-quantum-mechanics-lithium-metal.html,New method that uses quantum mechanics can lead to improved lithium metal batteries,"In a recent study published in Nature Energy, Dr. Perla Balbuena and Dr. Jorge Seminario from Texas A&M University have made significant progress in understanding the effects of external pressure on lithium-metal batteries. By using quantum mechanics, they have developed a new method to explore the behavior of lithium ions under pressure, with the aim of improving battery fabrication processes and creating more efficient battery technologies.

The research conducted by Balbuena and Seminario falls under the Battery500 Consortium, a collaborative effort among national labs and academia to develop more reliable and high-performing vehicle batteries. Led by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, this consortium aims to achieve the goals set by the Department of Energy.

Lithium-ion batteries have played a pivotal role in revolutionizing the mobile electronics industry, allowing for the development of compact devices that can easily fit into our pockets. However, these batteries still face certain limitations, particularly in terms of energy density, which is restricted by the battery components.

According to Seminario, lithium-ion batteries rely on two essential electrodes to convert lithium ions into neutral species, thereby storing energy as chemical energy. The first electrode, known as the anode, contains lithium ions with maximum energy, while the second electrode, called the cathode, has lithium ions with minimum energy. This energy difference is what drives the migration of lithium ions from the anode to the cathode during discharge, allowing the flow of electrons to power external devices.

To overcome the limitations of current lithium-ion batteries, researchers are exploring alternative materials, such as lithium metal, as a replacement for the conventional graphite anode. Theoretically, this substitution could significantly enhance energy density within the anode.

However, lithium metal is highly reactive and requires innovative control measures. One such measure is the application of external pressure to the battery. While it is known that external pressure can have a profound effect on cell performance, there is a lack of research exploring the relationship between external pressure and the electroplating of lithium in large-format pouch cells to improve overall battery performance.

Furthermore, when the battery undergoes cycling, its components may experience volume changes, leading to cell swelling and affecting battery performance and cycle life.

Balbuena and Seminario's research aims to understand why pressure can help achieve a more uniform distribution of lithium ions on the anode, preventing the formation of dendrites that could potentially short-circuit the battery. By using theoretical-computational techniques, the researchers meticulously analyzed the effects of pressure on lithium-metal anodes.

Their key finding is that lithium ions tend to detour towards regions with higher pressure or a higher concentration of lithium atoms on the surface. This behavior is due to the electric field generated by the lithium-metal anode.

This discovery has significant implications for predicting the behavior of novel materials proposed for advanced applications. By understanding the behavior of ions under these conditions, researchers can develop lithium-metal batteries with longer battery life and increased functionality, using less expensive infrastructure and fabrication processes.

The research conducted by Balbuena and Seminario demonstrates the impact of first-principles ab initio analysis on the design of macroscopic processes. Similar methods can be applied to improve chemical and physical processes in fields such as chemical engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, materials science, and biology.

In conclusion, the study published in Nature Energy by Dr. Perla Balbuena and Dr. Jorge Seminario offers valuable insights into the effects of external pressure on lithium-metal batteries. Their research provides a deeper understanding of lithium-ion behavior and paves the way for the development of longer-lasting and more efficient battery technologies. By exploring alternative materials and utilizing innovative control measures, researchers can overcome the limitations of current lithium-ion batteries and create a brighter future for energy storage.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/new-discovery-can-lead.jpg,2024-03-25 17:06:08,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/london-regtech-gss-raises-47m-to-help-banks-screen-for-global-sanctions/,London regtech GSS raises $47M to help banks screen for global sanctions,"Global Screening Services (GSS), a London-based regulatory compliance platform, recently announced that it has raised $47 million in a funding round. This comes at a time when economic sanctions are on the rise, with the United States imposing trade restrictions and asset blocking against several countries, including Russia, China, and Iran.

GSS, led by co-founder and CEO Tom Scampion, is focused on helping financial institutions meet their global sanctions obligations. Scampion, who previously served as the head of financial crime for Deloitte's EMEA arm, left the company in 2020 to become a general partner at consulting firm AlixPartner. It was during his time at AlixPartner that GSS was initially incubated before being spun out as an independent entity in 2021.

Last year, GSS secured a similar amount of funding from prominent investors such as Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), one of the world's largest banks. For its latest funding round, GSS has attracted another major player in the financial industry: the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA). In addition to CBA, the funding round also included investments from Cynosure Group and AlixPartner.

Financial institutions often find themselves at the forefront of sanctions enforcement due to their role in facilitating global money transfers. However, identifying the parties involved in these transactions is not always straightforward. In 2019, Standard Chartered faced $1.1 billion in fines from regulators in the UK and the US for inadequate money-laundering controls, including violations of sanctions against countries like Iran. Similarly, BNP Paribas was fined a staggering $8.9 billion in 2014 for processing financial transactions for US-sanctioned countries.

Given the challenges faced by banks in complying with sanctions regulations, investors have shown a growing interest in regulatory compliance businesses. Last year, New York-based Droit raised $23 million in funding, while London's SteelEye secured $21 million.

GSS offers a sanctions-screening platform that enables financial institutions to comply with regulations. Institutions input transaction data into GSS's cloud-based platform, which then compares the data against a standardized set of sanctions lists from around the world. GSS also enhances these lists with additional data points, such as dates of birth and International Maritime Organization (IMO) numbers for ships. The company also provides enhanced screening lists that include companies with partial ownership by individuals, companies, or governments that have been sanctioned by regulatory bodies such as the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the European Union (EU), or the United Kingdom (UK).

With the recent funding, GSS is now transitioning from the development phase to becoming fully operational. The company is preparing to launch its services to its first customers, marking an important milestone in its journey.

In conclusion, GSS's recent funding round highlights the increasing importance of regulatory compliance in the financial industry. As economic sanctions become more prevalent, financial institutions require robust solutions to meet their obligations. GSS's innovative platform positions it well to address these needs, and its successful funding round is a testament to its potential for growth and success in the market.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1770041999-e1711386339681.jpg?resize=1200,677",2024-03-25 18:36:37,Innovation,Innovation

Can you believe it? March is almost over, and it has been quite an unusual month. Winter seems to be holding on tightly, not giving way to spring. Although the sun is shining today and the snow is melting, there is more snow in the forecast for Easter weekend. And to top it all off, the day after Easter is April Fool's Day, a day I dread. It's probably best to stay offline and avoid any pranks on that day.

Interestingly enough, it was on April Fool's Day that I managed to solve not just one, but two Wordles with a single guess. I chose ""march"" thinking that if someone were playing an April Fool's prank in the style of Wordle, they would pick the only other month with five letters that is not just a proper noun. (April itself is a proper noun and therefore cannot be a Wordle answer.)

Speaking of proper nouns, yesterday's Wordle really caught me off guard!

Now, let's get to solving today's Wordle.

The Hint: Politician.
The Clue: The word ends with a consonant.

Spoiler alert! The answer is:

Wordle Analysis

Every day, I eagerly check Wordle Bot to see how well I did. You can also check your Wordles with Wordle Bot right here.

I was so confident on my third guess, only to have my hopes crushed when the third box turned gray. Oh well, that's life! My initial guess was almost there, but not quite. I had 196 words remaining and only one yellow 'O'. Crane reduced it to 11 and gave me two more yellows to work with. I tried different combinations and settled on ""major"" because out of all the words I could think of, two of them had the letter 'M' in them. Unfortunately, it turned out to be ""mayor"" instead of ""major"" for today's Wordle.

Competitive Wordle Score

I lose 1 point because the Bot solved it in just three guesses (crane / tyros / mayor — tyros? Seriously?), and I get 0 points for guessing in four. So, overall, I'm at -1. Sigh.

Today's Wordle Etymology

The word ""mayor"" comes from the Old French ""maire,"" which means ""head of a city or town government."" This word has its roots in the Latin word ""maior,"" meaning ""greater"" or ""superior."" In Latin, it was used in the title ""maior domus"" or ""major domo,"" which referred to the ""chief steward"" of a noble house, indicating a position of authority and supervision. Over time, ""maior"" transformed into various forms in Romance languages, eventually giving rise to the English word ""mayor."" The role of a mayor as the leader of a city or municipal government reflects the historical sense of being a superior or chief official within a local jurisdiction.
