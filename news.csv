Here's the good, the bad, and the ugly","DevOps engineering is a highly sought-after job in today's economy. However, it requires a combination of technological expertise and business acumen. Moreover, staying relevant in this field necessitates a commitment to continuous learning, as popular approaches quickly become outdated.

The demand for DevOps engineers, who are responsible for automating and collaborating on both cloud and on-premises environments to ensure the seamless development and deployment of software, is soaring. In the US, for instance, the average salary for DevOps engineers is approximately $134,000 per year, according to estimates from Talent.com.

But being a DevOps engineer is not without its challenges, as seasoned practitioners will attest. To begin with, a solid understanding of foundational technology is crucial, as stated by Brad Morgan, an experienced DevOps engineer, in a recent YouTube presentation.

At the top of Morgan's skills list is Linux proficiency. Regardless of the specific role within DevOps, interfacing with Linux is a fundamental requirement. Having a strong background in Linux is essential, including a good understanding of its basics, familiarity with using the terminal, and knowledge of basic commands.

Additionally, DevOps engineers must possess bash scripting skills, which automate Linux commands. Bash scripting is widely used in the DevOps world, particularly in building pipelines. Morgan emphasizes the importance of becoming proficient in a mainstream cloud provider, such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure. Mastering one cloud vendor at a time is recommended rather than trying to become an expert in multiple platforms.

Becoming a DevOps engineer does not follow a specific course of study. Instead, self-learning is the most effective path to pursue a career in this field. Continuous learning, enjoying the process of acquiring new knowledge, and consistently challenging oneself are essential traits for success.

The need for constant learning and skill updating was also highlighted by ""Homebrew Henry,"" another seasoned DevOps engineer, in a recent YouTube presentation. DevOps engineering is an ever-evolving field, with tools and frameworks that were once popular being replaced by new alternatives. In addition to regular work responsibilities, DevOps engineers often need to dedicate their free time to studying and staying up to date.

Learning never stops, even as one gains more experience. This aspect of the job is often cited as one of the most enjoyable aspects of being a DevOps engineer. With the rapid pace of development and the introduction of AI tools like ChatGPT, the DevOps engineering of today will be different from the DevOps engineering of two or three years from now.

One aspect that distinguishes passionate DevOps engineers from their colleagues is their enthusiasm for infrastructure management. Henry cautions that if managing infrastructure is not appealing, one may struggle in this role. DevOps engineers spend a significant amount of time setting up, configuring, and maintaining cloud infrastructure. This involves dealing with servers, databases, networks, and security on a daily basis. If this excites you, then the world of DevOps engineering may be perfect for you.

However, if you are more inclined toward software engineering, tasks like writing Terraforms, CI/CD pipelines, and automation scripts may not satisfy your coding itch. It is not quite the same as building customer-facing applications, and you may not feel that your coding abilities are fully utilized.

The good news is that there are numerous examples of individuals transitioning from software engineering to DevOps and vice versa. So, if you decide to choose one path, remember that you are not locked into it forever.

Another crucial aspect to consider is the business side of DevOps. This starts with managing realistic expectations for the role. DevOps is currently in high demand, and businesses often expect that hiring a few engineers will magically solve all their problems. As a result, management may overlook the fact that implementing DevOps practices requires a comprehensive understanding of the organization's specific needs and challenges.

In conclusion, DevOps engineering is a dynamic field that offers exciting opportunities but also presents challenges. To excel in this role, one must possess a strong foundation in technology, including Linux proficiency and bash scripting skills. Additionally, becoming adept in a mainstream cloud provider is highly recommended. Continuous learning and a passion for staying up to date with the latest developments are essential traits for success. Infrastructure management is a significant aspect of the job, and individuals who enjoy this aspect will thrive in the field. Transitioning between software engineering and DevOps is possible, and the business side of DevOps should not be overlooked. By embracing these key considerations, aspiring DevOps engineers can pave the way for a rewarding and fulfilling career in this rapidly evolving field.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/e4d3d8d263eb00323161fcf2566ad35a3fe52282/2024/03/25/1b8b924e-2629-43c2-b416-1b990e262786/gettyimages-1319039490.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/can-you-hear-me-now-ai-coustics-to-fight-noisy-audio-with-generative-ai/,Can you hear me now? AI-coustics to fight noisy audio with generative AI,"Can you hear me now? AI-coustics to fight noisy audio with generative AI

Noisy audio recordings can be a headache for audio engineers. But a German startup called AI-coustics is hoping to solve this problem using generative AI technology to enhance the clarity of voices in videos. With â‚¬1.9 million in funding, AI-coustics aims to go beyond standard noise suppression by working across any device and speaker.

The co-founder and CEO of AI-coustics, Fabian Seipel, states that their mission is to make every digital interaction, whether it's a conference call or a casual social media video, as clear as a professional studio broadcast. Seipel, an audio engineer, teamed up with Corvin Jaedicke, a lecturer in machine learning at the Technical University of Berlin, to establish AI-coustics in 2021. They were motivated by the poor audio quality they experienced during online courses and tutorials.

AI-powered noise-suppressing and voice-enhancing software is already prevalent in the market. AI-coustics' competitors include Insoundz and Veed.io. However, AI-coustics claims to have a unique approach to developing AI mechanisms for noise reduction. They use a model trained on speech samples recorded in their studio in Berlin. People are paid to record these samples, which are then added to the training dataset.

AI-coustics also takes steps to address bias in their technology. They focus on recruiting diverse speech sample contributors and believe that size and diversity are crucial in eliminating bias and making the technology inclusive for all languages, speaker identities, ages, accents, and genders.

To test AI-coustics' performance, three video clips were uploaded to their platform: an interview with an 18th-century farmer, a car driving demo, and an Israel-Palestine conflict protest. The processed clips showcased improved clarity, with less ambient background noise overshadowing the speakers.

Seipel envisions AI-coustics' technology being used for real-time speech enhancement and embedded in devices like soundbars, smartphones, and headphones to automatically boost voice clarity. Currently, AI-coustics offers a web app and API for post-processing audio and video recordings.

The startup generates revenue through subscriptions, on-demand pricing, and licensing. They currently have five enterprise customers and 20,000 users. Their future plans include expanding their team and improving the underlying speech-enhancing model.

Despite some concerns about compensation for creators of training data and potential bias, AI-coustics shows promise in revolutionizing audio quality and making digital interactions clearer and more enjoyable for everyone.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1009979808.jpg?resize=1200,801",2024-03-25 18:43:01,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/timtreadgold/2024/03/25/us-and-australia-get-cosy-over-critical-metals/,U.S. And Australia Get Cosy Over Critical Metals,"The global demand for critical metals used in innovative technologies and renewable energy is bringing the U.S. and Australia closer together while creating a gap with China. Recent deals involving lithium and rare earths highlight these trends. Pilbara Minerals, an Australian lithium miner, is looking to strengthen ties with the U.S. and take advantage of investment incentives, even as it partners with a Chinese company for an expansion project. The company plans to build a lithium conversion plant outside of China and utilize the U.S. Government's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) to its advantage. The Australian Financial Review aptly captured Pilbara Minerals' strategy with the headline: ""Pilbara Minerals mulls building a lithium processing plant anywhere but China."" The details of how Pilbara will structure a joint venture with a Chinese partner while accessing the IRA incentives are yet to be determined.

The second deal between Australia and the U.S. involves finding a solution to a long-standing challenge of monetizing a unique geological structure abundant in rare earths and other critical minerals. The Export-Import Bank (EXIM), a trade finance arm of the U.S. Government, has provided a $600 million letter-of-interest to Australian Strategic Minerals (ASM) to support the final design and development of the Dubbo project in New South Wales, Australia. Following this announcement, ASM awarded Bechtel, a leading U.S. engineering and construction firm, a contract to provide ore processing and infrastructure technical services. The involvement of a government financing agency and a major engineering company solidifies U.S. support for the Dubbo project, which has undergone a 30-year evaluation process to find a profitable way to extract resources from a complex ore body.

Ailie MacAdam, the president of Bechtel Mining and Metals, emphasized the global strategic importance of the Dubbo project in the rare earths and critical minerals sector. The minerals targeted at Dubbo, such as neodymium, praseodymium, tantalum, niobium, hafnium, and zirconium, have various industrial applications. The challenge for ASM has been finding ways to separate these different metals and produce materials that meet customer requirements at a competitive price. The Australia-U.S. Taskforce on Critical Minerals has focused on the Dubbo project as part of its efforts to leverage Australia's geological resources for the benefit of U.S. industry. Rowena Smith, the chief executive of ASM, believes that the Dubbo project is well-positioned to support the joint objectives of Australia and the U.S.

In summary, the global search for critical metals has forged closer ties between the U.S. and Australia, while creating a gap with China. The deals involving lithium and rare earths demonstrate the efforts of Australian companies to expand their reach beyond China and leverage the incentives offered by the U.S. government. The collaboration between Australian Strategic Minerals and Bechtel in the Dubbo project highlights the strategic importance of rare earths and critical minerals for both countries. These partnerships reflect the shared objectives of Australia and the U.S. to secure a stable supply of critical metals for their respective industries.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660204347dcbbcbc0ad19587/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 21:27:14,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/large-language-models-can-help-home-robots-recover-from-errors-without-human-help/,Large language models can help home robots recover from errors without human help,"Home robots have faced numerous challenges that have hindered their success in the market. Factors such as pricing, practicality, form factor, and mapping have all contributed to their failure. Even when these issues are addressed, there is still the question of how a robot handles mistakes.

This issue is not limited to the consumer market; it is also a challenge on an industrial level. However, large companies have the resources to address problems as they arise. Consumers, on the other hand, cannot be expected to learn how to program or hire someone for assistance every time a robot makes a mistake. Fortunately, researchers from MIT have found a solution using large language models (LLMs) in the field of robotics.

A study presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) in May focuses on bringing ""common sense"" into the process of correcting mistakes. The researchers discovered that robots are excellent mimics, but unless they are programmed to adapt to unexpected situations, they struggle to handle mistakes without starting from scratch.

Traditionally, when a robot encounters an issue, it exhausts its pre-programmed options before requiring human intervention. This is particularly challenging in an unstructured environment like a home, where any changes can affect a robot's ability to function. Imitation learning, which involves learning tasks through observation, is popular in home robotics. However, it often fails to account for the small environmental variations that can disrupt regular operation, forcing the robot to start over. The new research tackles this problem by breaking demonstrations into smaller subsets instead of treating them as continuous actions.

This is where LLMs come into play. They eliminate the need for programmers to manually label and assign numerous subactions. LLMs provide natural language instructions for each step of a task, while a human's continuous demonstration embodies these steps in physical space. The goal of the research is to connect the two, allowing the robot to automatically know its progress in a task and enabling it to replan and recover on its own.

To demonstrate this approach, researchers trained a robot to scoop marbles and pour them into an empty bowl â€“ a simple task for humans but a combination of small tasks for robots. The LLMs can list and label these subtasks. In the demonstrations, researchers intentionally disrupted the activity by bumping the robot off course and knocking marbles out of its spoon. Instead of starting from scratch, the system self-corrected the small tasks.

""With our method, when the robot makes mistakes, we don't need to rely on humans to program or provide extra demonstrations on how to recover from failures,"" says Tsun-Hsuan Wang, a graduate student involved in the research.

This innovative approach allows robots to adapt and correct mistakes without human intervention. It provides a more efficient and automated way to handle variations in the environment, making home robots more practical and user-friendly. With further advancements in LLMs and robotics, the future of home automation looks promising. So, the next time a robot makes a mistake, remember that it has the ability to self-correct and continue its task without losing its marbles.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/CommonSense-01-press_0.jpg?w=900,2024-03-25 20:01:06,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/fisker-trading-suspended-by-nyse/,Fisker trading suspended by NYSE,"The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) made an announcement on Monday that it will suspend trading shares of electric vehicle (EV) startup Fisker and is taking steps to delist the company from its stock exchange. The NYSE stated that Fisker's stock is no longer suitable for listing due to its abnormally low price levels. This decision comes after the NYSE warned Fisker last month that its stock price had been trading below $1 for 30 consecutive days, which violates the exchange's rules.

Fisker has the option to review the NYSE's determination, but the company stated in a filing on Monday that it anticipates its stock will be moved to an over-the-counter market, such as OTC Pink. The delisting also triggered repayment clauses in two outstanding loans that Fisker is currently unable to afford, which could have a significant negative impact on the business.

This suspension marks a challenging day for Fisker, with shares falling over 28% before trading was halted. Earlier in the day, Fisker revealed that it had lost a potential deal with a major automaker, rumored to be Nissan. This development puts a recently announced attempt to secure emergency funding in jeopardy as well. Fisker did not provide an explanation for why the automaker terminated the negotiations, which was a critical condition for a potential $150 million convertible note announced the previous week. Fisker stated in the filing that it will request the unnamed investor to waive the closing condition.

Fisker has been facing various issues for several months, including customer complaints, lawsuits, and federal investigations. The struggling EV startup has encountered difficulties in selling its Ocean SUV, falling short of its own sales goals. It initially adopted a direct sales model but later shifted towards using dealerships to boost sales. Additionally, Fisker has struggled with quality problems that it has found challenging to resolve, according to internal documents.

In February, Fisker laid off around 200 employees, which accounted for 15% of its staff. As of last week, the company reported having only $121 million in cash reserves. Fisker has halted production and cautioned investors that it would not survive a year without a fresh injection of funds.

Please note that this story has been updated to include information from Fisker's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday afternoon.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fisker-GettyImages.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-25 21:06:18,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/profluent-spurred-by-salesforce-research-and-backed-by-jeff-dean-uses-ai-to-discover-medicines/,"Profluent, spurred by Salesforce research and backed by Jeff Dean, uses AI to discover medicines","Last year, Salesforce, the well-known company behind cloud sales support software and Slack, embarked on a project called ProGen, which aimed to design proteins using generative AI. The researchers behind ProGen claimed that if brought to market, this project could help uncover medical treatments more cost-effectively than traditional methods. In a January 2023 blog post, they shared their excitement about the potential impact of this research moonshot.

ProGen reached a significant milestone when research was published in the journal Nature Biotech, demonstrating that the AI technology could successfully create the 3D structures of artificial proteins. However, beyond this publication, the project didn't progress much commercially at Salesforce or elsewhere.

But recently, there has been a new development. Ali Madani, one of the researchers involved in ProGen, has founded a company called Profluent. His goal is to bring protein-generating technology similar to ProGen out of the lab and into the hands of pharmaceutical companies. In an interview with TechCrunch, Madani described Profluent's mission as ""reversing the drug development paradigm."" The company aims to start with patient and therapeutic needs and work backward to create customized treatments.

Madani realized the parallels between natural language, such as English, and the ""language"" of proteins while working at Salesforce's research division. He discovered that proteins, which are chains of bonded-together amino acids used by the body for various purposes, can be treated like words in a paragraph. By feeding protein data into a generative AI model, entirely new proteins with novel functions can be predicted.

With Profluent, Madani and co-founder Alexander Meeske, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Washington, want to take this concept further and apply it to gene editing. Madani explained that many genetic diseases can't be fixed by directly using proteins or enzymes from nature. Current gene editing systems face limitations due to functional tradeoffs, preventing them from reaching their full potential. In contrast, Profluent aims to optimize multiple attributes simultaneously to create a custom-designed gene editor for each patient.

This idea is not out of the blue. Other companies and research groups have demonstrated the potential of generative AI in predicting proteins. For example, Nvidia released a generative AI model called MegaMolBART, which was trained on a dataset of millions of molecules to search for potential drug targets and forecast chemical reactions. Meta trained a model called ESM-2 on protein sequences, enabling the prediction of sequences for over 600 million proteins in just two weeks. DeepMind, Google's AI research lab, developed AlphaFold, a system that predicts complete protein structures with unprecedented speed and accuracy.

Profluent is training its AI models on massive datasets containing over 40 billion protein sequences. The aim is to create new gene-editing and protein-producing systems and fine-tune existing ones. Instead of developing treatments itself, the startup plans to collaborate with external partners to produce ""genetic medicines"" with the most promising paths to regulatory approval.

Madani believes that this approach could significantly reduce the time and capital typically required to develop a treatment. According to industry group PhRMA, it takes an average of 10-15 years to develop one new medicine from initial discovery to regulatory approval. The cost of developing a new drug is estimated to be several hundred million to $2.8 billion. Madani sees Profluent's capability as an opportunity to intentionally design much-needed solutions in biology, moving away from accidental discoveries.

Profluent, based in Berkeley and consisting of 20 employees, has received backing from prominent venture capitalists, including Spark Capital, which led the company's recent $35 million funding round. Insight Partners, Air Street Capital, AIX Ventures, and Convergent Ventures are also among the investors. The support of Google chief scientist Jeff Dean adds further credibility to the platform.

In the coming months, Profluent will focus on upgrading its AI models by expanding the training datasets. Madani also emphasized the importance of customer and partner acquisition. The company faces competition from rivals like EvolutionaryScale and Basecamp Research, who are rapidly developing their own protein-generating models and securing significant amounts of venture capital.

Madani expressed confidence in Profluent's initial platform and scientific breakthroughs in gene editing. He believes that now is the time to scale up and collaborate with partners who share the company's ambitious vision for the future.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1288172035.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-25 22:08:51,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/bankrupt-ev-startup-arrival-sold-its-assets-to-canoo/,Bankrupt EV startup Arrival sold its assets to Canoo,"Bankrupt electric vehicle (EV) startup, Arrival, has recently sold some of its assets, including advanced manufacturing equipment, to struggling startup Canoo. Canoo aims to build and sell electric vehicles and this acquisition is seen as a cost-saving measure, expected to reduce capital expenditures by 20%. The assets purchased by Canoo will be transported to its facility in Oklahoma. It remains unclear whether Canoo also acquired any of Arrival's intellectual property (IP).

Arrival had previously announced its plans to sell off assets and IP from its U.K. division after filing for bankruptcy protection in the U.K. The company, once valued at over $13 billion and backed by Hyundai and UPS, had ambitious plans to revolutionize EV production by building compact ""microfactories"" in city centers. These plans included the production of electric buses, vans, and even a purpose-built car for Uber. However, Arrival faced financial difficulties, burnt through cash, and experienced executive departures. The company restructured multiple times, resulting in layoffs, and shifted its focus from the U.K. to the United States to preserve capital. Arrival never achieved large-scale production of commercial vehicles, and its market valuation currently stands at around $7.7 million. After a period of volatility and a significant decline in share price, the company ultimately filed for bankruptcy.

Canoo has also faced its own challenges. After going public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, the company struggled to produce its EV, which featured an eye-catching design based on a ""skateboard"" architecture. This architecture houses the batteries and electric drivetrain in a chassis located beneath the vehicle's cabin. Canoo previously reported having over $1 billion in its sales pipeline, primarily due to a deal with Walmart to purchase 4,500 units, with an option to buy up to 10,000 units. However, the company has faced difficulties in translating these sales into actual deliveries. Canoo is currently a pre-revenue company that is burning through cash and has had to resort to stock splits and issuing more shares to stay afloat. In the past, the company's stock price fell below $1, triggering a delisting notice, which resulted in a move to a different tier on the Nasdaq Exchange.

Despite the challenges faced by both Arrival and Canoo, the acquisition of assets from Arrival by Canoo presents an opportunity for the struggling startup to strengthen its position and overcome its production hurdles. By incorporating Arrival's advanced manufacturing equipment into its operations, Canoo aims to accelerate its progress towards commercial production. The cost-saving benefits of this acquisition may help Canoo improve its financial situation and enhance its ability to deliver on its sales pipeline.

As the EV industry continues to evolve, partnerships and acquisitions among startups are becoming more common. These collaborations enable companies to leverage each other's strengths, share resources, and overcome obstacles. While Arrival and Canoo have faced significant challenges individually, their partnership through this asset acquisition highlights the potential for collaboration and consolidation within the EV sector.

In conclusion, Arrival's sale of assets to Canoo represents a cost-saving measure for both companies. Canoo, which has been struggling to move past the prototype stage, can benefit from Arrival's advanced manufacturing equipment to accelerate its progress towards commercial production. Despite the challenges faced by both companies, partnerships and acquisitions within the EV industry offer opportunities for growth and consolidation. As the market continues to evolve, it is crucial for startups to adapt, collaborate, and innovate to thrive in the competitive landscape of electric vehicles.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/canoo-walmart-arkansas.jpg?resize=1200,670",2024-03-25 22:15:20,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/charliefink/2024/03/25/sxsw-2024-xr-that-makes-you-go-wow/,"SXSW 2024: XR That Makes You Go ""Wow""","The Golden Key, winner of the XR Jury Award at SXSW, is an awe-inspiring creation that leaves you in awe. Originally designed as a four-walled projection to completely immerse the audience, it was presented on three big screens instead. Powered by Stable Diffusion, a local version of the text to image generator, the installation automatically generated themed images based on unrelated short fairy tales.

Charlie Fink, the creator of The Golden Key's triptych, had to bring in extra power and air conditioning to accommodate the servers. Guests were given the opportunity to contribute their own prompts and witness how they manifested in the real-time generated stories projected on the screens. Even with just three screens, the experience was immersive, but one can only imagine the incredible impact of the original four-walled concept. The lightning-fast Stable Diffusion generated images from fairy tales, and guests could even add their own twists to the evolving narrative.

The Golden Key felt like a completely new medium unfolding before our eyes. Directed by Marc Da Costa and Matthew Niederhauser, it was a revelation, offering an entirely new experience and medium. Discovering something like this is the reason many of us return to SXSW year after year.

Da Costa and Niederhauser also presented Tulpamancer, which was previously featured at the Venice Film Festival. In this interactive experience, participants sat down at retro computer terminals and engaged with a tulpa, a thoughtform or imaginary companion. They answered questions about their own lives and typed out their responses. They were then invited to enter a world uniquely prepared for them, wearing VR headsets and embarking on a journey guided by their tulpa. The journey involved a series of virtual scenes that invoked and questioned the participants' memories and potential fates.

Another notable project in the XR experience area was Soul Paint, which received a Special XR Jury Award. Written and directed by Sarah Ticho, and produced by Anna Firbank, the piece left a lasting impression. Additionally, Eliza McKnitt's Astra, set in space like her previous award-winning XR experience, Spheres, was captivating. Impulse, a work-in-progress that shared the stories of individuals living with ADHD, also stood out. Both experiences utilized Mixed Reality, blending outward-facing HD cameras with digital elements to create immersive and engaging narratives.

Reimagined Volume III: Young Thang, created by a female-led team in partnership with Meta, brought a fresh perspective to VR animation. This anthology series showcased lesser-known fables, mythology, and folklore, taking viewers on a unique journey into a new kind of storybook. Shadowtime, another selection from the Venice Film Festival, offered a poetic contemplation of escapism and the real-world threats posed by climate change.

Detachment, a satirical VR experience by Ristband, known for their multidimensional mixed reality concerts, was also noteworthy. The cinematic journey follows a voice-over actor as they navigate the programming of a script.

Ristband made a strong impact at SXSW 2024 with their Official Future x Music event. The event featured an ambisonic A/V installation, a critically acclaimed mixed reality concert by the band Pivots, and performances from international artists Glasser, Pivots, Moritz Simon Geist, Minimal Schlager, and Kikuo. Blending game design, cinema, virtual reality, live performance, and generative AI visuals with ambisonic audio, Ristband showcased the ways artists are leveraging technology to tap into new potentials presented by merging music, video, and gaming.

Chris Madsen, Senior Sales Engineer for VR Metaverse Engage, described the event as a transformative and immersive journey between the physical and digital realms. Attendees experienced this journey through Pico Neo 4E mixed reality headsets, provided by MACE Virtual Labs, which transported them between physical reality and fully immersive virtual dreamscapes, shifting their consciousness to the fantastical.

Overall, the XR experiences at SXSW 2024 left a lasting impression, showcasing the incredible potential of technology to create immersive and transformative experiences. These innovative projects pushed the boundaries of storytelling, offering new mediums and perspectives to captivate audiences.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660200d15ac92b36fd540aa5/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=937,527,x48,y0,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 18:57:26,Innovation,Innovation
