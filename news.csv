https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-liquid-iron-battery-grid-energy.html,New all-liquid iron flow battery for grid energy storage,"A Revolutionary Battery Design for Large-Scale Energy Storage

In a groundbreaking development, researchers at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have repurposed a commonplace chemical used in water treatment facilities to create a new battery design for large-scale energy storage. This innovative design offers a safe, economical, water-based, flow battery made with Earth-abundant materials. It presents a promising solution for integrating intermittent energy sources like wind and solar energy into the nation's electric grid.

The researchers, as reported in Nature Communications, conducted experiments on a lab-scale, iron-based battery and were astounded by its remarkable cycling stability. Over one thousand consecutive charging cycles, the battery maintained an impressive 98.7% of its maximum capacity. This is in stark contrast to previous studies that found degradation of charge capacity two orders of magnitude higher over fewer charging cycles in similar iron-based batteries.

Iron-based flow batteries have been in existence since the 1980s, with some even being commercially available now. However, what sets this battery apart is its unique liquid chemical formula for energy storage. It combines charged iron with a neutral-pH phosphate-based liquid electrolyte, or energy carrier. The key ingredient, called nitrogenous triphosphonate or NTMPA, is commercially available in industrial quantities due to its use in inhibiting corrosion in water treatment plants.

NTMPA is part of a broad chemical family known as phosphonates, which are based on the element phosphorus. Many phosphonates, including NTMPA, dissolve well in water and are non-toxic chemicals used in fertilizers and detergents, among other applications.

The development of new flow battery technologies is crucial to modernize the U.S. electric grid and provide a means of storing energy from renewable sources such as wind and solar power. The researchers were specifically looking for an electrolyte that could bind and store charged iron in a liquid complex at room temperature and mild operating conditions with a neutral pH. Their goal was to develop battery materials that are abundant on Earth and can be sourced domestically.

So, what exactly is a flow battery? As the name suggests, flow batteries consist of two chambers, each containing a different liquid. These batteries charge through an electrochemical reaction and store energy in chemical bonds. When connected to an external circuit, they release the stored energy, which can power electrical devices. Unlike conventional batteries, flow batteries have two external supply tanks of liquid that constantly circulate through them, providing the electrolyte—essentially acting as the battery system's ""blood supply."" The larger the electrolyte supply tank, the more energy the flow battery can store.

In this case, the aqueous iron (Fe) redox flow battery captures energy from renewable sources in the form of electrons (e-) and stores it by changing the charge of iron in the flowing liquid electrolyte. When the stored energy is needed, the iron can release the charge to supply energy (electrons) to the electric grid.

Flow batteries have the potential to serve as backup generators for the electric grid, making them a key component of decarbonization strategies aimed at storing energy from renewable resources. One of their advantages is their scalability, from lab-bench scale, as demonstrated in the PNNL study, to the size of a city block.

In the short term, grid operators are considering locating battery energy storage systems (BESS) in urban or suburban areas near energy consumers. However, safety concerns are often raised by city planners. The type of aqueous flow battery developed in this study could help address these concerns.

""A BESS facility using the chemistry similar to what we have developed here would have the advantage of operating in water at neutral pH,"" explained Aaron Hollas, a study author and team leader in PNNL's Battery Materials and Systems Group. ""In addition, our system uses commercially available reagents that haven't been previously investigated for use in flow batteries.""

While the initial design of the iron-based flow battery can achieve an energy density of up to 9 watt-hours per liter (Wh/L), it falls short of the energy density of commercialized vanadium-based systems, which exceed 25 Wh/L. Higher energy density batteries can store more energy in a smaller space. However, a system built with Earth-abundant materials could be scaled up to provide the same energy output.

The future development of this iron-based flow battery holds great promise for revolutionizing large-scale energy storage. Its utilization of a commonplace chemical and its ability to store energy safely and economically make it an attractive option for integrating renewable energy into the electric grid. As this technology advances, we can expect to see significant advancements in the quest for a sustainable and efficient energy future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/new-all-liquid-iron-fl.jpg,2024-03-25 07:22:25,Innovation,Innovation

He successfully led a strike against major automakers, including General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis. The union achieved significant gains from these strikes, but Fain isn't stopping there. He has set his sights on new goals and challenges.

One of Fain's recent accomplishments was securing commitments from President Joseph Biden to support the unionizing efforts at Volkswagen AG's factory complex in Tennessee. This move followed previous unsuccessful attempts by the UAW to unionize the Tennessee VW plant. While the outcome of this latest organizing try remains uncertain, Fain is determined to fight for the rights of autoworkers.

In addition to his work in the auto industry, Fain is advocating for a four-day workweek without any reduction in pay. In a joint opinion piece with Senator Bernie Sanders published in The Washington Post, Fain highlighted the increasing productivity of American workers compared to the 1940s. Despite this, many workers are putting in longer hours for lower wages. Fain and Sanders argue that it's time for a change and that Americans deserve better working conditions.

The UAW has a long history of addressing social issues beyond the auto industry. Former union leaders like Walter Reuther, Leonard Woodcock, and Douglas Fraser were vocal advocates for civil rights and other important causes. However, in recent decades, the union has faced financial difficulties and scandals, leading to a more cautious approach to social issues.

With Fain at the helm, it seems that the UAW is once again expanding its reach and influence. Fain's ambitions go beyond mere union talks with automakers. He is determined to fight for the rights and well-being of autoworkers and make a lasting impact on the labor landscape.

It remains to be seen where Fain's ambitions will lead him and the UAW. However, his dedication to the cause and his willingness to take on new challenges are clear. As the president of one of the most influential labor unions in the country, Fain is poised to make a significant difference in the lives of autoworkers and workers across various industries.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600bf00c2acfb8ee845a3b1/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 07:30:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-deep-geothermal-renewable-powerhouse.html,Dig deep: US bets on geothermal to become renewable powerhouse,"Geothermal energy is gaining attention as a potential solution for clean and reliable power. Despite currently contributing only a small fraction of US energy production, businesses and the Biden administration are optimistic about its future. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm believes that geothermal energy has the potential to surpass hydroelectric and solar power in the country by 2050.

Geothermal energy harnesses the heat beneath the Earth's surface to generate electricity and heat buildings. In 2022, it accounted for just 1.6 percent of US energy consumption. To increase geothermal production, the US government has invested over $200 million since 2018 in an experimental site in Utah. This site employs Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), a technology that involves injecting water into hot rocks deep underground, eliminating the need for nearby hot springs or reservoirs.

According to Francesco d'Avack, an analyst with S&P Global Commodity Insights, geothermal energy has the potential to be developed anywhere, reducing the upfront risk associated with drilling and finding nothing. Additionally, the US government has streamlined the conversion of permits for oil or gas exploration into geothermal licenses, simplifying the process for companies interested in transitioning to geothermal energy.

Compared to hydraulic fracturing or fracking, geothermal drilling requires fewer chemical additives and does not release hydrocarbons. Furthermore, geothermal energy provides a consistent flow of energy regardless of weather conditions or time of day. The cost of geothermal energy is also expected to decrease from $70 to $100 per megawatt hour (MWh) to $45 by 2035, making it an increasingly affordable option. Leveraging existing drilling technology makes geothermal development faster and more cost-effective.

The US has been at the forefront of geothermal technology, with several companies and start-ups securing significant investments. While experimental EGS sites exist in other countries, the US has taken the lead in developing this new technology. However, one potential risk associated with geothermal drilling is the potential for induced seismic activity. The US Energy Department ensures that all funded projects follow a mitigation protocol to address this concern and is actively funding research on the issue.

As the geothermal industry grows, companies like Fervo Energy are already connecting their sites to the electric grid. Fervo Energy collaborated with Google to develop a geothermal project in Nevada, which currently generates 3.5 megawatts of electricity. Major corporations like Google, Microsoft, and Nucor are also showing interest in purchasing geothermal energy, demonstrating a growing demand for clean power.

The geothermal market is still in its early stages, with ample opportunities for new players to enter. Once a successful commercial facility is established, it is expected that other companies will follow suit. According to Cindy Taff, CEO of Sage Geosystems, the industry's primary objective is responsible and sustainable growth.

In conclusion, geothermal energy offers a promising solution for clean and reliable power. With technological advancements and government support, the geothermal industry is poised for growth in the coming years. As more companies and investors recognize the potential of geothermal energy, it is likely to play a significant role in the green transition and diversification of the US energy mix.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/a-worker-operates-a-dr.jpg,2024-03-25 04:59:03,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/dma-first-formal-probes/,"Apple, Google and Meta face first formal investigations under EU's DMA","The European Union has recently announced a series of investigations on major tech companies, including Alphabet/Google, Apple, and Meta. These investigations are being conducted under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which designates these companies as gatekeepers. The EU is particularly interested in examining various aspects of these companies' operations to determine if they are in compliance with the DMA.

Alphabet/Google is under scrutiny for its rules on steering in Google Play and its approach to self-preferencing in search results. Apple's rules on steering in the App Store and the design of choice screens for alternatives to its Safari web browser are also being investigated. Additionally, Meta's ""pay or consent"" model will be subject to scrutiny by the European Commission.

These three gatekeepers were designated under the pan-EU regulation last fall, and the formal investigations will determine whether they are breaching the rulebook. Violations of the DMA can result in fines of up to 10% of global annual turnover, or even 20% for repeat offenses. The EU has up to 12 months to conclude the investigations, with a preliminary report possible within six months.

This enforcement action by the EU comes as antitrust scrutiny on these three US companies continues to increase, even on their home turf. Since unveiling their DMA compliance plans, the companies have faced criticism that their proposals do not fully comply with the new EU law.

Google has faced accusations of attempting to bypass the regulation's ban on self-preferencing by launching new rich features in search results that unfairly compete with rivals. Apple's use of notifications to warn users of risks outside its walled garden has been criticized by developers as ""scare screens."" Meta's ""pay or be tracked"" tactic has also been condemned by privacy and consumer rights groups.

The European Commission has opened proceedings to assess whether Alphabet and Apple's measures in relation to their app stores violate the DMA. The Commission is concerned that these companies' steering measures may not be fully compliant, as they impose restrictions and limitations that hinder developers' ability to freely communicate and promote offers.

Regarding Google's self-preferencing, the investigation will focus on its vertical search services, such as Google Shopping, Flights, and Hotels, and the impact these actions may have on rival services.

The EU will also examine whether Apple is complying with user choice obligations on iOS, including enabling easy uninstallation of apps, changing default settings, and providing choice screens for alternative default services.

In the case of Meta, the proceedings will investigate whether its ""pay or consent"" model for EU users complies with the DMA, which requires gatekeepers to obtain consent from users when combining or cross-using their personal data across different core platform services.

Margrethe Vestager, the Commission EVP in charge of competition policy, expressed concerns that the proposed solutions put forward by these companies do not fully comply with the DMA. The investigations will ensure open and contestable digital markets in Europe.

The Digital Markets Act became applicable on March 7, and discussions have been ongoing with gatekeepers to help them adapt. While changes are already being observed in the market, the EU remains unconvinced that the solutions provided by Alphabet, Apple, and Meta meet the requirements of the DMA.

In conclusion, the European Union has launched investigations into major tech companies to assess their compliance with the Digital Markets Act. These investigations will focus on various aspects of these companies' operations and their adherence to the rules and regulations set forth by the EU. With potential fines of up to 10% of global annual turnover, these investigations highlight the EU's commitment to ensuring fair and competitive digital markets.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1031626648.jpg?resize=1200,799",2024-03-25 12:10:10,Innovation,Innovation
