If you're looking for hints, clues, and the answer to today's Wordle puzzle, you've come to the right place. Lazy Sunday is here, and Easter is just around the corner. Have you ever considered making rabbit pot pies for Easter dinner? The irony would add a delightful twist to the savory dish.

But for now, let's focus on solving today's Wordle puzzle. The hint for today is ""Useful when dry, useless when wet,"" and the clue is that the word starts with a consonant. Spoiler alert: the answer is revealed below!

Analyzing Today's Wordle

After a rocky start with the guess ""chain,"" which resulted in a whopping 681 words, I managed to narrow it down to 19 with the word ""slope."" Eventually, I landed on the word ""below,"" a fitting guess for the puzzle. It's amazing how sometimes a random guess like ""towel"" can surprisingly work out. Is it just a coincidence or something more?

Competitive Wordle Score

Unfortunately, today's Wordle attempt resulted in a total wash with zero points for guessing in four attempts and zero for tying the Wordle Bot. It's zeroes all around this time!

The Etymology of the Word ""Towel""

The word ""towel"" has its roots in the Old French term ""touaille,"" which made its way into English around the 13th century. This Old French word likely originated from the Medieval Latin term ""tovaglia,"" which itself may have derived from the Latin ""tubicula,"" a diminutive form of ""tuba,"" meaning ""tube"" or ""cloth."" The evolution of this word reflects the item's practical use for drying or wiping.

The transition from ""touaille"" in Old French to ""towel"" in English showcases the linguistic blend of Norman French influences on the English language post the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. Despite changes in pronunciation and spelling over time, towels have remained a household essential for centuries, adapting in material and function while maintaining their core purpose of drying or wiping.

While Google is often seen as following Apple's lead, it has recently introduced a groundbreaking feature that surpasses anything Apple has offered before. This exciting new update is coming to Android first and is set to revolutionize the way we use our smartphones.

Google has been making significant efforts to make Android more like iPhone. Recent enhancements include improved security measures, the addition of WhatsApp calls to the phone dialer, and the integration of Apple passes into its wallet. Now, with this latest update, Google not only matches an existing iPhone feature but goes above and beyond, surpassing Apple in its own game.

One notable feature that Google has added is an emergency satellite service, which allows Android users to access the same satellite SOS functionality that iPhone users have had for years. However, Google's offering goes even further by incorporating a ready-made Garmin rescue service into its plan. This is a significant step forward in ensuring the safety and security of Android users.

Apple's emergency SOS feature is limited to emergencies, which means that it is only useful for those engaging in extreme activities like mountain climbing or sailing. However, with the latest Android 15 developer preview, Google is bridging this gap. It is now possible for users to expand their cellular accounts to include a satellite add-on, enabling core messaging apps to utilize the satellite network. This eliminates the issue of cellular black spots and ensures that users remain connected even in areas with poor coverage.

According to Mishaal Rahman, Android 15 DP2 introduces UI elements that create a consistent user experience for devices that support satellite connectivity. Additionally, a new API has been added to the update, allowing apps to detect when a device is connected to a satellite. Android 15 also enables SMS/MMS/RCS apps to use satellite connectivity for sending and receiving messages.

The ability for messaging apps to utilize satellite connectivity is the most exciting aspect of this update. Some networks are already planning to offer LEO satellite connectivity as an account option. This is a significant improvement from what was initially expected when Google prematurely updated Pixel phones with a ""Satellite SOS"" feature. Apple's satellite connectivity is more limited, only allowing users to text emergency services, request roadside assistance, and share their location while off the grid with no mobile or Wi-Fi coverage.

There were hopes that Android would go even further with satellite messaging, as previous beta code suggested a partnership with T-Mobile for this purpose. The potential of direct satellite connectivity to smartphones was further highlighted when Elon Musk announced that SpaceX achieved download speeds of 17mbps to an unmodified Galaxy S21 Ultra. This suggests that smartphones could connect directly to satellites without requiring any special hardware, allowing users to make calls and send messages even in areas with no cellular network coverage. While this future may not be here yet, the integration of messaging apps with satellite connectivity is a significant step forward.

It is now confirmed that Android 15 will include satellite messaging capabilities, barring any major changes. As Android and iPhone continue to converge, this development serves as an example of Google taking the lead, with Apple likely to follow suit. This news comes shortly after the revelation that Gemini, a powerful AI technology, might be coming to iPhone. Apple's claim that the DOJ lawsuit could turn iPhone into Android has made this an interesting week for smartphone enthusiasts.

In an update on March 23, it was revealed that Google's plans for satellite messaging coincided with the news that Gemini might be coming to Apple's iPhone. This is significant because it signifies a further closing of the gap between Android and iPhone and enhances Google's role within the iPhone ecosystem.

Overall, this update showcases Google's commitment to improving Android and providing users with innovative features. As Android and iPhone become more similar, users can expect even more exciting developments in the future. The integration of satellite messaging is just the beginning, and we can't wait to see what else Google has in store.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65d79ec3dadcd6b682668331/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-23 19:17:25,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianmazique/2024/03/23/ufcs-dana-white-cuts-fighter-immediately-after-he-bit-an-opponent/,UFC’s Dana White Cuts Fighter Immediately After He Bit An Opponent,"LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - MARCH 23: A bite mark on the arm of Andre Lima of Brazil is visible after his flyweight fight against Igor Severino of Brazil during the UFC Fight Night event at UFC APEX on March 23, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Severino was disqualified for biting Lima in the second round. 

Pressure and competition in sports can lead individuals to behave unexpectedly. This was evident on Saturday night at UFC Fight Night: Ribas vs. Namajunas when Igor Severino, in his UFC debut, bit his fellow Brazilian opponent, Andre Lima, during the second round of their preliminary match. The bite, resulting in a disqualification, was clearly captured in images showing bite marks and occurred while Severino was in a standing grappling position behind Lima.

Despite being a 20-year-old fighter with potential, Severino's actions have jeopardized his future in the UFC. The disqualification marked the first loss of Severino's career, bringing his record to 9-1, while Lima maintained his undefeated status at 8-0.

Following the incident, UFC CEO Dana White swiftly announced Severino's release from the promotion. White expressed disappointment, stating, ""Those were two up-and-coming undefeated fighters.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/23/explained-the-difference-between-a-solar-eclipse-and-a-lunar-eclipse/,Explained: The Difference Between A Solar Eclipse And A Lunar Eclipse,"Have you ever wondered about the difference between a solar eclipse and a lunar eclipse? Two fascinating celestial events are on the horizon—a lunar eclipse on March 25 and a solar eclipse on April 8. Despite their distinct characteristics, both are triggered by the same cosmic alignment.

A lunar eclipse occurs when Earth's shadow falls on the moon, while a solar eclipse takes place when the moon obstructs the sun's light, casting a shadow on Earth. These occurrences are uncommon due to the slight disparity in the orbital planes of Earth and the moon around the sun.

The Mechanics of a Lunar Eclipse
A lunar eclipse occurs exclusively during a full moon, when Earth stands between the sun and the moon, projecting a shadow into space. Although full moons occur every 29 days, a lunar eclipse is a rare phenomenon when the moon traverses Earth's shadow.

The Mechanics of a Solar Eclipse
Conversely, a solar eclipse can only happen during a new moon, when the moon is positioned between the sun and Earth, casting a shadow on our planet. While new moons occur every 29 days, it is infrequent for the moon to obscure the sun's light as observed from Earth, resulting in a solar eclipse.

The Enigma of a Total Lunar Eclipse
During a total lunar eclipse, a flawless alignment of the sun, Earth, and moon occurs. Earth possesses two shadows—the outer penumbral shadow and the central umbral shadow. When a full moon enters Earth's umbra, it receives no direct sunlight, causing its surface to be illuminated by sunlight refracted through Earth's atmosphere. This phenomenon results in a mesmerizing pinkish-red hue on the lunar surface, known as the ""Blood Moon.""

The upcoming March 25 event will be a penumbral lunar eclipse, as the full ""Worm Moon"" passes through Earth's penumbra.

The Mystery of a Total Solar Eclipse
A total solar eclipse is the result of a precise alignment of the sun, moon, and Earth, combined with a celestial anomaly. During a new moon, the moon's umbra is projected onto Earth when it perfectly obstructs the sun, a feat possible due to the moon's size and proximity to Earth. The umbral shadow moves across Earth's surface as the moon orbits from west to east, creating a path of totality where a total solar eclipse can be witnessed.

On April 8, a total solar eclipse will occur as the new ""Pink Moon"" perfectly blocks the sun, casting an umbral shadow over North America.

The Rarity of Lunar and Solar Eclipses
Eclipses are relatively rare due to the moon's tilted orbit around Earth, intersecting the sun's path at a slight angle. This intersection occurs twice monthly, but for an eclipse to transpire, the moon must be at its new or full phase. This scenario unfolds twice a year, leading to two ""eclipse seasons"" where solar and lunar eclipses occur. However, most solar eclipses are partial or annular, while lunar eclipses are typically penumbral or partial.

Mark Your Calendar for 2024 and 2025
In 2024, two eclipse seasons will occur on March 25 and September 17, featuring a penumbral lunar eclipse and a total solar eclipse visible in North America. Similarly, in 2025, eclipse seasons will commence on March 13 and September 7, showcasing a total lunar eclipse and a partial solar eclipse in various regions.

Have you ever thought you saw a total solar eclipse? Chances are, you actually witnessed a partial solar eclipse. The distinction is crucial, as the awe-inspiring moment of totality is something you never forget. It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience that leaves a lasting imprint on your memory.

The ""Great American Eclipse"" of 2017 brought this celestial wonder to 12 U.S. states, captivating millions with the stunning sight of the sun's corona shining in all its glory. If you were lucky enough to be in the path of totality, you know the feeling of being surrounded by darkness in the middle of the day, with the moon blocking the sun and revealing its majestic silhouette.

If you're unsure about whether you've truly witnessed a total solar eclipse, there are ways to verify your experience. By checking the Solar Eclipses Visibility Database and comparing your memory with the interactive maps provided, you can confirm whether you were indeed within the path of totality during a past eclipse event.

Looking ahead to April 8, 2024, another rare opportunity awaits North American skygazers. A total solar eclipse will sweep across a narrow path, offering a chance for millions to witness the magic of totality. This time, the path of totality will span parts of Mexico, the U.S., and Canada, creating a shared experience for millions of eager spectators.

As the date approaches, keep an eye on updates for travel and lodging options to ensure you don't miss out on this extraordinary event.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2024/03/24/epa-didnt-ban-gas-cars-it-cut-air-pollution-so-we-can-breathe-easier/,EPA Didn’t Ban Gas Cars. It Cut Air Pollution So We Can Breathe Easier.,"On days when the air quality turns red, the taste of pollution lingers in the air, leaving a harsh sensation in your nose and lungs. People are cautioned to stay indoors and avoid outdoor activities during these times, especially vulnerable groups like the elderly, children, pregnant women, and those with respiratory issues.

The primary culprit behind toxic air in many places is the exhaust from internal combustion engines running on gas or diesel. With over two-thirds of Americans relying on personal vehicles for their daily commute, transportation has become the leading source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. Light-duty vehicles alone contribute to nearly 60% of the pollution in this sector, exacerbating climate change.

To address the pervasive air pollution problem, we need to reduce tailpipe emissions from our vehicles. The good news is that we have a proven solution to make our cars cleaner and the air we breathe fresher: tailpipe emissions standards.

Recently, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency took a significant step by implementing new rules for light-duty and smaller medium-duty vehicles to limit tailpipe pollution. These updated standards push automakers to embrace cutting-edge clean technologies, ensuring that future vehicles will be more environmentally friendly than ever before.

It's crucial for everyone to have the option to choose a clean car for their next purchase. Individuals who prioritize reducing pollution should have the opportunity to drive electric vehicles.

Despite the benefits of cleaner air and consumer choice, some entities are pushing back against these pollution limits. Corporations profiting from selling polluting vehicles and petroleum are framing these standards as a threat to American freedoms and consumer options.

In reality, these updated pollution restrictions are long overdue and will benefit all Americans by improving air quality and offering consumers an alternative to costly fossil fuels. Any claims suggesting that the standards ban gas cars are simply misinformation. The EPA's standards are technology-neutral, performance-based, and grounded in scientific research.

The Clean Air Act, enacted in 1970, empowers the EPA to establish National Ambient Air Quality Standards to safeguard public health and regulate hazardous air pollutants. The Act also mandates the EPA to regulate vehicle emissions and adapt standards over time.

Early standards for light-duty vehicles mandated a significant reduction in emissions, driving innovation in engine and emission control technologies like catalytic converters and unleaded fuel. Prior to the Clean Air Act, cities like New York and Los Angeles were plagued with thick smog, leading to health issues and poor air quality.

Today, we have the opportunity to build on past progress and continue improving air quality for all Americans. By embracing cleaner technologies and supporting updated emissions standards, we can create a healthier environment for current and future generations. Let's prioritize clean air and sustainable transportation choices for a brighter, healthier future.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fe401fc35aefb76700b52e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 07:45:00,Innovation,Innovation

The cerebral areas located in the frontal lobe, responsible for attention, organizational skills, and emotional responses are abnormally active or have a specific anatomy. There is also an imbalance in levels of some chemical messengers in the brain, such as dopamine and noradrenaline.

A recent study involving 221,714 individuals with ADHD revealed that those prescribed ADHD stimulant medications had a lower risk of suicide attempts and psychiatric hospitalizations. Heidi Taipale and her team from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden found that specific ADHD medications, including amphetamine, lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate, were associated with decreased psychiatric hospitalizations.

Furthermore, lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate were linked to a reduced risk of suicidal behavior. Psychiatric comorbidities, such as major depressive disorder and substance abuse, were prevalent among individuals with ADHD, increasing the risk of mortality, especially when combined with substance use disorder.

While atomoxetine did not lower the risk of psychiatric hospitalizations or suicidal behavior, it was associated with fewer hospitalizations for non-psychiatric comorbidities. The study highlighted the importance of ADHD medications in improving overall functioning and quality of life, despite some potential adverse effects like psychosis and cardiovascular concerns.

The research, published in JAMA Network Open on March 20, 2024, emphasized the need for further investigation into the long-term effectiveness and safety of ADHD pharmacotherapies. The study followed individuals aged 16 to 65 in Sweden who were diagnosed with ADHD between 2006 and 2021, analyzing their healthcare data from the Swedish National Patient Register.

Overall, the study indicated positive outcomes associated with ADHD medication use, particularly in reducing psychiatric hospitalizations and suicidal behavior. Different medications showed varying effectiveness across age groups and genders, with lisdexamphetamine being more beneficial for certain demographics.
