https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-vulnerability-virtual-reality.html,Vulnerability in virtual reality systems identified,"Virtual reality (VR) systems have opened up a whole new world of possibilities, allowing users to immerse themselves in virtual environments. However, a team of computer scientists from the University of Chicago has recently discovered a potential vulnerability in these systems. They have identified a way for hackers to insert an ""inception layer"" between a user's VR Home Screen and their VR User/Server, which could lead to serious security breaches. The team has published their findings in a paper on the arXiv preprint server, shedding light on this alarming issue.

To better understand the implications of this vulnerability, let's delve into the details. Imagine a scenario where hackers are able to add an app to a user's VR headset. This app would deceive users into behaving in ways that could compromise their sensitive information. The researchers describe this app as an ""inception layer,"" drawing inspiration from the movie ""Inception,"" where a character's reality is manipulated through downloaded information.

Essentially, this inception layer acts as a barrier between the user and the virtual world they see through their VR device. With this layer in place, hackers could record information, such as passcodes entered into a virtual ATM. They could also intercept and alter transaction details, rerouting funds to their own bank accounts. Furthermore, they could introduce virtual characters representing friends or family, exploiting trust to gain access to personal secrets. In essence, this app has the potential to monitor and manipulate various aspects of a user's VR experience, including gestures, voice interactions, browsing activity, and social or business interactions.

The implications of such an app are significant, and the researchers warn that it could be installed on a user's VR device if the hacker gains access to their WiFi network or has physical access to the device. Once installed, the app could operate unnoticed by the user. To demonstrate this, the researchers conducted an experiment involving 28 volunteers who used a demonstration VR headset to play a game. The researchers downloaded the app onto the devices, simulating a hacking scenario, and then asked the volunteers if they had noticed anything unusual. Only 10 of the volunteers noticed a slight flickering during the download and activation process, and just one of them questioned whether something malicious was happening.

Upon discovering this vulnerability, the research team promptly notified Meta, the company behind the Meta Quest VR system used in the experiment. Meta has assured the researchers that they will investigate the issue and take necessary steps to address it if confirmed. The researchers emphasize that similar vulnerabilities are likely to exist in other VR systems and apps that attempt to insert themselves between users and their VR devices.

This revelation raises concerns about the security of VR systems and the potential for unauthorized access to personal and sensitive information. As VR technology continues to evolve and gain popularity, it is crucial for developers and manufacturers to prioritize security measures and address vulnerabilities promptly.

In conclusion, the University of Chicago research team has identified a potential vulnerability in VR systems that could allow hackers to insert an ""inception layer"" between a user's VR Home Screen and their VR User/Server. This layer could be used to manipulate and exploit users, compromising their sensitive information and altering their VR experiences. The researchers have brought this issue to the attention of Meta, the company behind the Meta Quest VR system, and have urged for further investigation and action. As the popularity of VR systems grows, it is imperative that security remains a top priority to protect users from potential threats and breaches.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/vulnerability-in-virtu.jpg,2024-03-25 10:20:02,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have many similarities in their growth trajectories. Both companies stumbled upon their core businesses by accident. AWS discovered that it could sell its internal services, such as storage and computing power, to external customers. Similarly, Nvidia found that its gaming GPU was well-suited for AI workloads.

This realization led to explosive revenue growth for both companies. Nvidia's revenue has been growing at triple digits, reaching $22.1 billion in Q4 2024 from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024. The majority of this growth was in Nvidia's data center business. While AWS did not experience such rapid growth, it has consistently been a major revenue driver for Amazon.

Both companies were in the right place at the right time. As web apps and mobile usage increased, the cloud provided on-demand resources for enterprises. Similarly, the rise of AI and large language models coincided with the increased use of GPUs for processing these workloads.

Although AWS has become a highly profitable business, its growth has started to slow down. On the other hand, Nvidia's growth is taking off. However, it's important to consider the law of large numbers, which will eventually affect Nvidia's growth as well. The question is whether Nvidia can sustain its growth and become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS.

Nvidia does have other businesses to rely on if the GPU market tightens. However, these businesses are smaller and growing at a slower pace compared to the data center business. 

In the short term, Nvidia's revenue growth has been astronomical, and it is expected to continue. In its recent earnings report, Nvidia projected $24 billion in revenue for the current quarter, representing a 234% growth compared to the year-ago first quarter. Analysts expect Nvidia to generate $110.5 billion in revenue in the current fiscal year, an 81% increase from the previous year.

While the growth rate is expected to decline, Nvidia is still anticipated to scale its revenue past the $100 billion annual run rate mark for the next several quarters. The company has significant growth potential, even if the growth figures may slow down in the future.

Looking ahead, AI presents a promising opportunity for Nvidia. Despite emerging competition from companies like AMD and Intel, Nvidia currently dominates the market. However, it is expected to face stiffer competition in the future. Nevertheless, Nvidia's strong position in the market allows it to withstand some competition.

In conclusion, Nvidia's growth trajectory resembles that of AWS. Both companies stumbled upon their core businesses and experienced significant revenue growth. While AWS's growth has slowed down, Nvidia's growth is still going strong. The future looks promising for Nvidia, especially in the AI space, although it will face increasing competition.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.zdnet.com/article/saving-hours-of-work-with-ai-how-chatgpt-became-my-virtual-assistant-for-a-data-project/,Saving hours of work with AI: How ChatGPT became my virtual assistant for a data project,"There has been a lot of hype surrounding generative artificial intelligence (AI) recently, with tools like ChatGPT gaining attention. While they are powerful tools, it's important to remember that they are just that – tools. They can assist with projects, much like other productivity software.

In this article, I'll share a project where ChatGPT saved me a significant amount of time. Although you might not have the same project, I hope it will inspire you to consider ChatGPT as a valuable tool for your own projects.

Let's dive into the project itself. I will be posting what I call a ""stunt article"" in a month or so. These articles are fun and interesting for readers. The article I'm working on is about how much computer gear I can buy from Temu for under $100. I managed to come in at a budget of $99.77.

To put this article together, I had to search the Temu site for items to feature. For example, I found an iPad keyboard and mouse that cost about $6. However, staying within my budget required me to add all the Temu links to a spreadsheet, find each product's price, and rearrange things until I reached my desired budget.

The challenge was converting the Temu links into usable data. That's where ChatGPT came in.

Phase 1 involved gathering all the links. I copied each link from Temu and pasted it into a Notion page. Notion allows you to create bookmark blocks that not only contain links but also crucially include product names. Here's a snapshot of the page:

[Insert screenshot of Notion page]

As you can see, I selected the blocks and copied them. I then pasted the entire set into a text editor. It might look messy, but it proved to be useful.

Phase 2 was about identifying the data within the blocks. Let's take a closer look at one of the data blocks:

[Insert screenshot of data block]

Within each block, there are three key elements. The gold text represents the product name, surrounded by braces. The green text is the base URL of the product, surrounded by parentheses. I only needed the main URL, so I disregarded everything after the question mark. The purple sections highlight the delimiters – this is the data we'll feed into ChatGPT.

Phase 3 involved teaching ChatGPT to recognize the data. I started by prompting ChatGPT to accept the data and await further instructions. Then I copied all the information from the text editor and pasted it into ChatGPT. At this point, ChatGPT knew to wait for more details.

The next step was crucial. I wanted ChatGPT to extract the titles and links, leaving the rest behind. Here's the prompt I used:

[Insert prompt for extracting titles and links]

This prompt achieved two things. Firstly, it allowed me to name the data for later reference. Secondly, it tested whether ChatGPT understood the task.

ChatGPT successfully completed the assignment but stopped about two-thirds of the way through due to its buffer running out. I instructed the bot to continue, and it provided the rest of the data. Doing this process manually would have involved tedious cutting and pasting, but ChatGPT finished the work in under a minute.

Phase 4 involved cleaning up Temu's complex titles. For my project, the titles were too long and unnecessary. Instead of using titles like ""10 Inch LCD Writing Tablet, Electronis Memo With Leather Protective Case, Electronic Drawing Board For Digital Handwriting Pad Doodle Board, Gifts For,"" I wanted something simpler like ""LCD writing tablet with case."" I assigned this task to ChatGPT as well, reminding it that it had already parsed and identified the data. I find that reminding ChatGPT about previous steps helps it more reliably incorporate the information.

In conclusion, ChatGPT proved to be a valuable tool for this project. It saved me significant time and effort, allowing me to gather and organize data efficiently. While this specific project might not be relevant to you, I hope it inspires you to explore how ChatGPT can assist with your own projects.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/70d8814af33b190ff84b8faa5f9bafe13d3586e2/2024/03/25/7d1cb1ff-3bb7-4972-a6cd-33d04da76bc1/cover.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-deep-geothermal-renewable-powerhouse.html,Dig deep: US bets on geothermal to become renewable powerhouse,"Geothermal energy is gaining attention as a potential solution for the transition to green energy. While it currently accounts for a small percentage of US energy production, businesses and the Biden administration are investing in advancements to make geothermal power a reliable and scalable source of clean energy.

Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm believes that harnessing the heat beneath our feet can provide clean and consistent power for industries and households. The Department of Energy predicts that geothermal energy could surpass hydroelectric and solar power in the US by 2050.

Geothermal energy utilizes the high temperatures underground to generate electricity and heat buildings. However, in 2022, it only accounted for 1.6% of US energy consumption. To increase production, the US government has invested over $200 million since 2018 in an experimental site in Utah. This site employs Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), which involve injecting water into very hot rocks deep underground.

One advantage of EGS is that it can be implemented anywhere, reducing the upfront risk associated with drilling. Granholm also highlighted that the government is simplifying the permit process by allowing companies to convert oil or gas exploration permits into geothermal licenses. Furthermore, geothermal drilling requires fewer chemical additives compared to traditional fracking methods and does not release hydrocarbons.

Geothermal energy offers a continuous flow of power regardless of weather conditions or time of day. It is also becoming more cost-effective, with estimates suggesting that the cost per megawatt hour (MWh) will decrease from $70-$100 to $45 by 2035. The use of existing drilling technology has made geothermal development quicker and more affordable.

The United States has been at the forefront of geothermal technology, but other countries, such as France, have also begun exploring geothermal energy. However, there is a potential risk of induced seismicity associated with geothermal drilling, similar to fracking. The US Energy Department requires funded projects to follow a mitigation protocol to address this issue.

Several start-ups in the US and Canada are competing in the geothermal market and have attracted significant investments. For example, Fervo Energy, in collaboration with Google, has connected its Nevada site to the electric grid. As the supply of geothermal energy grows, demand is also increasing, with companies like Google, Microsoft, and Nucor purchasing geothermal energy.

The geothermal energy market is still in its early stages, but the potential for growth is significant. Once a company successfully demonstrates the viability of geothermal energy, others are likely to follow suit. The primary objective for the sector is to ensure responsible and sustainable growth.

In conclusion, geothermal energy has the potential to become a prominent source of clean and reliable power. Investments in technological advancements and government support are driving the development of geothermal projects. As the industry grows, it will contribute to the green transition and provide an alternative to traditional energy sources.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/a-worker-operates-a-dr.jpg,2024-03-25 04:59:03,Innovation,Innovation

Mustafa Suleyman will now lead Microsoft AI's consumer-facing unit, while Karén Simonyan assumes the role of EVP and CEO of the same group. This move comes after Inflection raised $1.3 billion, with Microsoft being the largest investor.

Nvidia's GTC event was also a significant event this week. CEO Jensen Huang made some surprising announcements, including a prediction that artificial general intelligence is just five years away. Additionally, Nvidia unveiled a new AI platform called GR00T, designed specifically for humanoid robots.

In a surprising development, Google and Apple are reportedly in talks about deploying Google's AI model to power several upcoming iOS updates. This raises questions about whether this collaboration is temporary or could lead to a long-term partnership.

Moving on to hacking and privacy news, the Biden administration is forming an international coalition to combat commercial spyware. Interestingly, some investors who are now part of this coalition were previously involved in the very business they are fighting against.

In the gaming world, a hack disrupted a $5 million Apex Legends tournament. The hackers claimed it was done for fun and to expose a vulnerability to the developers.

Glassdoor users have reported a concerning issue where their real names are being added to their profiles without consent. The only solution provided to them is to delete their accounts entirely, which raises concerns about privacy and data protection.

Now, let's shift our focus to funding and IPOs.

Reddit's IPO had a strong start, with its stock jumping 48% on the first day. Astera Labs, a company specializing in connectivity hardware for cloud computing data centers, also saw a successful debut, with its stock closing at a high on day one.

In other funding news, The Browser Company raised $50 million at a valuation of $550 million. This startup, behind the Arc browser, aims to supplant PCs with browsers but faces challenges in terms of monetization.

And now, for a bonus round of interesting tech news.

AI has proven to be bad at spelling, and one reason for this is the image generators used in AI models. Despite its potential, AI still struggles with basic spelling, as seen in AI-generated images.

Fisker, an electric vehicle manufacturer, has paused production due to financial difficulties. If the company fails to raise more capital, it could face the possibility of ceasing operations.

Lastly, while AI systems like ChatGPT and Gemini are difficult to review comprehensively, it is crucial to put them to the test. As AI continues to advance, it becomes increasingly important to evaluate its capabilities and limitations.
