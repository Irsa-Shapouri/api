https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/24/meet-the-apps-that-tell-you-when-to-take-your-eclipse-glasses-off/,Meet The Apps That Tell You When To Take Your Eclipse Glasses Off,"When it comes to watching a solar eclipse, knowing when to remove your eclipse glasses can be a bit confusing. There are a few key factors to consider in order to fully enjoy this dynamic event. First, you need to be within the path of totality, which is only 115 miles wide. Secondly, you must have a clear sky wherever you are. And finally, you need to know the right time to remove your glasses to witness the sun's majestic corona.

For many people, it's this last point that causes some panic and uncertainty. But the answer is actually quite simple: you remove your eclipse glasses when it gets dark. If you are lucky enough to be in the path of totality, the darkness will come suddenly as the moon's shadow passes over you. It's a moment you won't easily miss. However, if you are not in the path of totality, it will not get dark, so you should continue using your glasses.

Fortunately, there are now smartphone apps available that can enhance your eclipse-viewing experience. These apps provide an immersive audio guide that instructs you on when to remove your glasses as totality begins. They can also help you identify and observe other phenomena, such as shadow bands, Baily's beads, and the diamond ring effect. These apps rely heavily on audio instructions, so it's best to use them with headphones. Instead of earbuds that block out the people around you, consider using bone conduction earphones for a more comfortable experience.

One such app is the ""Pro"" version from The Eclipse Company. This app offers real-time weather updates, cloud forecasts for totality, a countdown timer with a vibration alert to safely remove your glasses, and detailed information about local eclipse events. It also alerts you to look for eclipse phenomena, creating an immersive audio experience. However, the Pro version may cost extra, so be sure to check the pricing details.

Another option is the Solar Eclipse Timer App, which is available for both iOS and Android devices. This app uses your location to confirm whether you are within the path of totality or not. It then guides you through the contact times and helps you observe the various eclipse phenomena. Developed by eclipse chaser and educator Gordon Telepun, this app is particularly popular among photographers and even has a special ""Photographer's Mode"" that was developed with the help of ex-NASA eclipse calculator and photographer Fred Espenak.

For iOS users, there is also the One Eclipse app, created by the non-profit organization Astronomers Without Borders and Simulation Curriculum. This app not only allows you to simulate the eclipse from your location or anywhere on Earth, but it also supports a recycling program for eclipse glasses in underserved communities worldwide. It features an interactive map with precise eclipse event times and a dynamic Eclipse Countdown clock that includes a simple audio timer for each phase of the eclipse.

In conclusion, knowing when to remove your solar eclipse glasses is crucial for experiencing this awe-inspiring event. While the darkness during totality is a clear indicator, smartphone apps can provide additional guidance and enhance your overall eclipse-viewing experience. Whether you choose The Eclipse Company's app, the Solar Eclipse Timer App, or the One Eclipse app, these tools can help you make the most of this rare celestial event. Just remember to always prioritize your safety and protect your eyes when observing the sun.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have surprising similarities in their growth trajectories. Both companies stumbled upon their core businesses by accident. AWS realized it could sell its internal services, while Nvidia discovered that its gaming GPU was well-suited for processing AI workloads. As a result, both companies experienced explosive revenue growth.

Nvidia's revenue has been growing at triple digits, increasing from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024 to $22.1 billion in Q4 2024. The majority of this growth came from the company's data center business. Although Amazon did not experience the same rapid growth, AWS has consistently been a major revenue driver for the e-commerce giant. However, as Microsoft and Google entered the market, the cloud landscape became more competitive. Other chipmakers are also expected to gain market share in the future.

Both Nvidia and AWS were in the right place at the right time. As web apps and mobile usage increased in the early 2010s, the cloud became a valuable resource for on-demand computing power. Similarly, the rise of AI and large language models coincided with the use of GPUs for processing these workloads.

AWS has become a highly successful and profitable business, currently on track for a $100 billion run rate. However, its growth has started to slow down, while Nvidia's growth continues to accelerate. This slowdown is partly due to the law of large numbers, which will eventually affect Nvidia as well. The question is whether Nvidia can sustain its growth and become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS.

Nvidia does have other businesses to fall back on if the GPU market tightens, but these are smaller revenue generators growing at a slower rate than the data center business. Despite this, Nvidia's short-term financial outlook remains impressive. The company expects to generate $24 billion in revenue in its current quarter, representing a growth rate of 234% compared to the year-ago quarter.

Analysts predict that Nvidia will generate $110.5 billion in revenue in its current fiscal year, an 81% increase from the previous year. While this growth rate is lower than the previous year's 126% gain, it is still significant. In the next few quarters, Nvidia is expected to continue scaling its revenue past the $100 billion annual run rate mark.

AI is likely to be a major driver of growth for Nvidia in the coming years, even as competition from AMD, Intel, and other chipmakers increases. Nvidia currently has a strong hold on the market, but it will face tougher competition in the future. However, it has enough market control to withstand some competition.

In terms of market share, Nvidia remains dominant at the chip level. However, AMD is gaining ground at the board level. Despite this, Nvidia's market position is still strong.

In conclusion, Nvidia and AWS have experienced remarkable growth due to their core businesses and market advantages. While AWS's growth has slowed down, Nvidia's growth continues to accelerate. With AI as a driving force, Nvidia is poised for further growth in the coming years, even as competition increases.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/krisholt/2024/03/24/nyt-connections-hints-and-answers-for-monday-march-25/,"NYT ‘Connections’ Hints And Answers For Monday, March 25","Welcome to today's game of Connections! Get ready to test your skills and make some interesting links between words. If you're new to the game, don't worry, I'll explain how it works.

In Connections, you're presented with a grid of 16 words. Your task is to group them into four categories of four words each by finding the connections between them. These groups can be anything from horror movie franchises to types of verbs or even rappers.

Remember, there's only one correct solution for each puzzle, so choose your groups wisely. Be careful with words that could fit into multiple categories. If you're stuck, you can shuffle the words to get a fresh perspective and maybe spot some connections.

Each group is color-coded, with yellow being the easiest and purple the most challenging. The purple group often involves wordplay, so keep that in mind. And don't worry, I'll provide hints to help you along the way.

Now, let's dive into today's puzzle. Here are the 16 words you'll be working with:

1. PACE
2. CLIPPER
3. MOVE
4. MEDICINE
5. FASTER
6. PROMPTER
7. ROCKET
8. SPEED
9. GO
10. SPUR
11. COMMUTE
12. HURRY
13. RATE
14. VISION
15. CLIP
16. PACER

And here are the hints for each group:

Yellow group: something's swiftness
Green group: speed up!
Blue group: NBA team player
Purple group: linked by a term meaning ""over a long distance""

Take your time to think about the connections. If you need extra help, keep scrolling for the answers, but be careful not to spoil the fun.

And now, the moment you've been waiting for. Here are today's Connections answers:

Yellow group: how fast something is going (CLIP, PACE, RATE, SPEED)
Green group: ""step on it!"" (FASTER, GO, HURRY, MOVE)
Blue group: NBA team player (CLIPPER, PACER, ROCKET, SPUR)
Purple group: tele____ (COMMUTE, MEDICINE, PROMPTER, VISION)

Unfortunately, there's no perfect game today, but my overall streak is now up to five games in a row. It was interesting to see how the yellows and greens were like noun and verb versions of the same concept.

I quickly figured out the blues, although I suspected they might be a red herring. After correcting my mistake of including COMMUTE with the greens instead of FASTER, I focused on the purples and found the connection for a victory.

That's all for today's Connections clues and answers. If you need hints or the solution for Tuesday's game, be sure to check out my blog. And before I go, here's a life tip: treat yourself to a meal at the best restaurant in your area, even if you have to save up for it. It's an experience worth having.

Wordle Analysis
Like many of you, I eagerly check Wordle Bot to evaluate my performance. If you haven't tried it yet, I highly recommend giving it a go!

Today's puzzle had me scratching my head, I must confess. It didn't start off well, leaving me with a burdensome 195 possible solutions after my first attempt. Even after a slight breakthrough with ""boink,"" I was still far from solving the puzzle, as it only narrowed down the options to 40.

However, my fortunes changed when I stumbled upon ""allay."" This word proved to be a pivotal guess, revealing the presence of more than one ""L"" and leaving me with just a single word left to crack. I almost fell into the trap of choosing ""palsy"" before realizing I needed that second ""L."" After some brainstorming, I finally settled on ""sally,"" which, although often associated with a name, also denotes an obsolete battle tactic.

Competitive Wordle Score
Yet again, my efforts yielded no points. No reward for guessing in four tries or tying with the Bot. It's a humbling experience, but the thrill of the chase keeps me going.

The Etymology of Today's Wordle
Let's delve into the origins of ""sally"" outside its usual role as a proper noun. In this context, ""sally"" signifies a sudden rush or attack from a defensive position, or the act of embarking on a journey or new venture. The etymology of ""sally"" is a fascinating journey through various languages before finding its way into English.

The word traces its roots to Middle French, where ""sallie"" serves as the noun form of ""sallir,"" meaning ""to rush out, leap forth."" ""Sallir"" itself has its origins in Latin, specifically ""salire,"" which translates to ""to leap."" This Latin root has given birth to several related words in English, such as ""salient"" (prominently projecting) and ""assail"" (to attack), all encompassing the concept of movement or leaping forth.

Hence, the etymology of ""sally"" encapsulates the notion of sudden and unexpected movement, be it in a physical assault from a fortified stronghold or the commencement of a new adventure.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewwight/2024/03/24/helping-patients-access-sickle-cell-disease-treatments-in-west-africa/,Helping Patients Access Sickle Cell Disease Treatments In West Africa,"A happy patient from NaYa network recently shared her experience of obtaining medicine through NaYa's network. The patient, along with NaYa's agent and the pharmacist, posed for a photo in front of the pharmacy. This moment captured the positive impact NaYa has had on patients' lives. 

One dedicated researcher from Cameroon is on a mission to help patients in low-income countries in West Africa access affordable medicine for sickle cell disease. With over 4 million people worldwide affected by sickle cell disease, it is alarming to know that about 80% of these cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa. Furthermore, a staggering 89% of women in central and west Africa lack access to universal medical coverage. Dr. Marthe-Sandrine Eiymo Mwa Mpollo, a scientist and co-founder of NaYa Health, discovered that having a drug for sickle cell disease is not enough. Affordability is crucial for patients to benefit from these breakthroughs. 

Mpollo explains that the lack of access to medication inspired her to establish NaYa Health, a digital patient assistance platform. The platform aims to help underserved patients without insurance by providing them with timely access to medication through community savings, deferred payments, and a portable health-only savings account. NaYa Health conducted a pilot implementation in Cameroon's capital, which proved successful in empowering informal workers, increasing income for local medical providers, and ensuring access to critical services.

The efforts of NaYa Health have not gone unnoticed, as they were selected for the financial inclusion challenge by MIT Solve. Mpollo is proud to deliver on the promise of research findings by enabling patients with sickle cell disease in Cameroon to access the medicines they need without delay, even when facing financial constraints. 

Mpollo's passion for medicine stems from her upbringing in Cameroon. She vividly remembers watching shows about ""doctors without borders"" in the late 1980s. These shows exposed her to the devastating impact of sickle cell disease on individuals and their families, beyond just the financial burden. Witnessing the possibility of delivering impactful healthcare in resource-limited settings ignited her desire to bring healthcare to challenged communities. Although she initially set out to become a medical doctor, her journey led her to life science research in Canada and the US, where she obtained a doctorate from the Faculty of Medicine at Cincinnati. Her focus was on developing therapies for sickle cell disease, the first genetic disease discovered in people of African descent.

Through her research and scientific publications, Mpollo realized that access to medication is crucial for research to have a life-saving impact. This realization prompted her to launch NaYa Health. She emphasizes that scientists from the Global South have a unique perspective on the limitations and challenges faced in their own communities, particularly regarding affordability, access, and cultural acceptance of research findings. By tailoring their research to address these specific needs, scientists from the Global South can make a greater impact on their communities. Mpollo believes that end-to-end solutions, from the lab to the end users, are necessary to address healthcare issues in the Global South. Collaboration with local actors is also essential in defining or adapting distribution models for scientific findings.

In another part of Africa, a team of entrepreneurs, researchers, and health professionals in Zambia is utilizing artificial intelligence to improve care for pregnant women. Despite a significant decrease in Zambia's death rate for pregnant mothers between 2000 and 2017, there is still a 1% risk of maternal mortality. Tafadzwa Kalisto Munzwa, the founder and CEO of Dawa Health, based in Lusaka, Zambia, leads the DawaMom project. This initiative leverages AI tools, last-mile health workers, mobile clinics, and digital platforms to enhance maternal and child health. Currently, there are more than 60 community health workers supporting in-community healthcare through DawaMom, and over 800 mothers have signed up on the mobile platform.

The DawaMom project incorporates generative AI models that directly interact with patients, offering them personalized support and guidance throughout their pregnancy journey. This innovative approach ensures that pregnant women receive the necessary care and attention, reducing the risk of maternal mortality. By combining technology with the dedication of health professionals, Dawa Health is making significant strides in improving healthcare for pregnant women in Zambia.

These inspiring initiatives in Cameroon and Zambia demonstrate the power of innovation and collaboration in addressing healthcare challenges in low-income countries. By prioritizing affordability, accessibility, and community engagement, NaYa Health and Dawa Health are making a tangible difference in the lives of patients and their families. Through their dedication and creativity, they are proving that healthcare solutions can be tailored to specific contexts, ultimately saving lives and improving overall well-being.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66009a73668df974c31e0a4f/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=579,579,x127,y431,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 17:54:08,Innovation,Innovation
