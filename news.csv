Key Facts
A new study published in JAMA on Friday found long Covid was associated with a greater risk for autoimmune and autoinflammatory connective tissue disorders. The researchers recommend that because this link was found, doctors should monitor and test patients who previously had Covid for these diseases. The study included 354,527 participants with Covid and 6,134,940 control participants without Covid and found the risks of alopecia areata, alopecia totalis, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody associated vasculitis, Crohn's disease and sarcoidosis were higher in the Covid group. The more severe the Covid infection, the higher the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, vitiligo, alopecia totalis, vasculitis, ulcerative colitis, sarcoidosis, Sjögren syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis and adult-onset Still disease were. Long Covid is lingering symptoms—like loss of smell or taste, chest pain, shortness of breath or brain fog—following recovery from a Covid infection that can last for weeks or even years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report. The people most commonly affected by long Covid include those with underlying conditions, people who suffered from severe Covid symptoms, the unvaccinated and people who had multisystem inflammatory syndrome—a rare condition associated with Covid in which body parts like the kidneys and brain become inflamed—during or after Covid, the National Library of Medicine reports.
Big Number
23 million. That’s how many Americans are estimated to have symptoms of long Covid, according to data from the National Institute of Health.
Key Background
Long Covid has been linked to other disorders and issues. A study published in Science Translational Medicine in August affirmed the presence of long Covid and found organs like the liver, heart and kidneys may still be affected by Covid well after patients get over the virus. The lungs are the first organ affected by Covid infection, but the study also found that even if mitochondrial gene expression recovered in the lungs, it can still negatively impact other organs. Long Covid is also associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular issues, according to research from the American College of Cardiology published in February. Having long Covid more than doubled the participants’ chances of developing heart issues. A separate study published in the journal of International Urology and Nephrology found patients with long Covid face an increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease and have worse kidney outcomes in the post-acute phase of the disease. Long Covid has also been found to have negative effects on mental health as it’s been linked to fatigue, sleep disturbances, depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment and post-traumatic stress disorder, among other conditions, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reports.
Tangent
Research published in the Lancet suggests that Covid vaccines reduce the risks of long Covid, with data suggesting two doses is more effective at protection than one. According to MedlinePlus, an arm of the National Institutes of Health’s National Library of Medicine, post-Covid symptoms may present in one of three ways: Patients may develop new health issues months after a Covid infection; they seem to recover from Covid, but their symptoms come back; or they have symptoms that can linger for a span of days to years. Though they look different for everyone, long Covid symptoms can include heart palpitations, chest pain, diarrhea, stomach pain, coughing, shortness of breath or neurologic symptoms—like brain fog, headaches or sleep problems. Because there’s not a specific test for long Covid, a physician will ask about a patient's medical history, conduct a physical exam and then potentially order blood work and imaging tests in order to diagnose it.

Epic Games has revealed that with Fortnite revenue declining, the rest of the company is not in the best of shape. So, one way to combat that? Get Fortnite to do more brand deals but with…increasingly questionable companies.
Behold, the new “Shell Ultimate Road Trips” island in Fortnite, where the oil industry giant has made its own Fortnite creative island that players can explore and celebrate…the joys of gasoline, I guess. Here’s the Shell-written description:
“Explore our new island in Fortnite. Get ready for an adventure that is all about speed, acceleration, and performance, powered by Shell V-Power® NiTRO+ Premium Gasoline.”
The actual map in question is something of a car-based stunt course where Shell hired an actual Fortnite creator to design it (I won’t name them here, lest they get roasted). The island does in fact feature a full Shell gas station where you can fuel up your car, and Shell logo-emblazoned ramps.
Fortnite has done deals with many random companies over the years, and of course they are always ready to promote the newest Star Wars/Marvel/DC projects with a bunch of new skins in their shop. But uh, Shell is certainly a choice, and it makes you wonder at this point what sort of deals Fortnite is still rejecting. I’m picturing a Lockheed Martin island where fly jets through rings. A Pfizer island where you collect Zoloft pills to increase your health and shields.
You can watch the trailer for the new Shell island here to see just what you’re missing if you don’t visit:
The code is 0314 - 6322 – 8548! Have fun!
This comes in the wake of a brutal week/month/quarter for Epic, which shed 900 jobs and defiant CEO Tim Sweeney said he would continue pursuing projects like the metaverse, Epic Game store and lawsuits against Apple and Google, all of which have been burning through Fortnite cash, That stockpile has been reduced overall with the BR’s popularity falling and more players heading to the less profitable Creative side of the game. The one with Shell Oil Island.
I would expect to see even more brand deals than we’ve seen to date as Epic looks to squeeze cash from Fortnite whenever it can. It used to be much easier. The game was so massive that skin and battle pass sales alone were generating billions. Now? They have to get creative, especially if Sweeney remains on his warpath indefinitely. And now that Fortnite’s overseer Donald Mustard has left the company, it’s unclear what monetization doors may open in his absence. If this is a sign of what’s to come, this should be pretty painful to watch.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/forrester/2023/10/06/hollywood-strikes-set-the-stage-for-ai-negotiations-in-each-creative-industry/,Hollywood Strikes Sparking AI Negotiations In Every Creative Industry,"Advertising, design, fashion, journalism, publishing. These are just a few of the industries that will be completely changed by the inclusion of artificial intelligence.
On September 27, after 148 days, Writers Guild of America (WGA) leadership the writers’ strike. Union members will vote on the tentative deal — which covers a minimum pay increase, streaming residuals, and guardrails for the use of AI in writers’ rooms — between October 2 and October 9. SAG-AFTRA leaders also head into talks with the big Hollywood studios this week.
These strikes thrust technology — historically a in labor disputes — into the spotlight. The outcome sets a new precedent in the tension between workforce automation and workforce augmentation. A tentative WGA deal outlines several provisions to keep its members at the writers’ table if and when AI is used. For example, studios must hire at least three writer-producers for a guaranteed 10 consecutive weeks of work during the development of a series, and once projects are greenlighted, the minimum of writers increases. Writers are allowed to use AI to help with their work if the studio allows it, but the studios cannot require a writer to use AI software. This agreement also benefits the studios in that it conforms to the “human authorship” standard recently reaffirmed by the US Copyright Office.
Though the agreement marks the end of the 2023 writers’ strike, it’s only the beginning of workplace negotiations aimed to establish controls on the use of technology. Forrester has written extensively about the ways in which AI is revolutionizing work across functions and industries. In all of them, human governance is required to harness AI success. But like any technical revolution, fear is the first response.
According to Forrester, generative AI will reshape 4.5 times more jobs than it replaces, with significant impacts to white-collar jobs. In addition, Forrester predicts that from 2022 to 2030, agencies will replace 7.5% of jobs with automation — but that’s mostly limited to process-oriented roles that are easier to automate, not necessarily conceptual-oriented roles that leverage originality and human ingenuity.
Like advertising, Hollywood has a business model challenge that’s manifesting in labor disruption. The question of whether the WGA should limit the use of generative AI isn’t the real question; it’s whether it is done in the name of cost efficiency or creative effectiveness. Forrester believes in the latter. There is magic in combining AI and creativity.
Creative industries should consider these points:
Protection of human creativity. You can argue that limiting the use of generative AI is necessary to protect the integrity of human creativity and that AI-generated content lacks the originality and emotional resonance that comes from human experiences and perspectives. AI does not replace or devalue human creativity; it’s a tool to augment and unlock more potential for human creativity, even for more humans who may not have the innate talent to create but do have the mind to ideate.

Preservation of creative jobs. The concern that the widespread use of generative AI in content creation could lead to job losses is real but not absolute. The problem of strictly limiting its use may protect some jobs in the short term, but it won’t ensure that skills, expertise, or craft are forever preserved. Hollywood has been one of the strongest drivers of computational innovation for decades — AI is the next chapter, not the last.

Generative AI has the potential to enhance creative processes rather than replace them. It can be used as a tool to assist writers, generate ideas, or remove repetitive tasks, freeing up more time for writers and artists to focus on the aspects that require an intense human touch, such as storytelling, character development, and emotional depth. More creative opportunities, not fewer, are being produced.

There are plenty of ethical concerns around the use of AI-generated content, including issues of consent, ownership, and attribution. Limiting its use could be seen as an answer to these concerns and ensure that AI-generated content is used responsibly and ethically, but as any moviegoer knows, evil strikes first. Creative industries need to band together so that good governance and better business models prevail.
This labor battle waged over technological threats to the integrity of human creativity is the first of many. Generative AI will impact people’s livelihoods, and we must embrace the disruption to own it. Rather than imposing strict limitations, we should advocate for regulations and guidelines that promote responsible and ethical use of AI in every creative industry.

It's understandable during times of uncertainty that we tend to worry. As human beings, we're innately programmed and, equally, we react differently—and not always positively—when leaders call on us to demonstrate resilience.
However, there's no denying that organizational resilience is ultimately dependent on how we as individuals react to adversity. At a very personal level, what should such resilience mean to us? What's expected of us in a work setting when we’re asked to be resilient and how does that benefit us individually? These are some of the questions that CEOs should be asking to help their teams understand.
The good news is that the concept of needing to work on being more resilient isn't new to most of us. The pandemic underlined how adaptable and creative we can be in the face of uncertainty. One definition of individual resilience is: “the capacity of employees to utilize resources to continually adapt and flourish at work, even when faced with challenging circumstances.”
It's worth discussing what resilience means to each of us on a personal level to shift this topic to a more positive footing. The key is to move away from the perception that resilience is only a defensive measure. We must understand that resilience is about creating a working environment that's more agile, collaborative, creative and fun.
If we get the approach right, we'll feel empowered to take risks, which will create opportunities and make the workplace more rewarding. This is good for us individually, but also good for the organization—if employees are more engaged, a Gallup study suggests it can lead to 21% higher profitability.
There are barriers to overcome to enable each of us to become more resilient. They include:
• Imperfect Information And Difficulty Finding Information: If it's difficult to know what's going on or to find evidence to support decision-making, employees will lack the confidence to make crucial decisions.
• Organizational Silos: These are often the source of imperfect information. If you don't have a single view of all the information in your organization, you'll make flawed decisions. A key aspect of resilience is giving employees access to the right information at the right time.
• The Lack Of Broader Skills: In the past, jobs could be clearly defined but now, with the fast pace of change, the lines between roles are more blurred and the demand for generalists with a range of skills is increasing. If you can't compete for that talent, how are you building up those skills internally?
• No Clear Direction: It's the responsibility of senior leadership to outline the vision, mission and strategy. Within this framework, we should have permission to make decisions and act, but without such clarity, it only increases uncertainty and confusion.
There's another factor to building resilience in individuals within organizations, which is reliant on an unspoken contract between employer and employee. It reflects how most human relationships work, which some academics call the psychological contract, or ""a set of unwritten expectations that exist between individual employees and their employers.""
It sounds intangible but our emotional connection to anything evokes both a rational and an emotional response. There's also a direct correlation between the health of this contract and the resilience of an individual employee. If a company is perceived to break the contract, it can have a negative impact.
It's incumbent on organizations to foster the right conditions to encourage resilience among employees. Key factors include:
• Being A Diverse Organization: Encourage diverse opinions. If we feel we're represented, it encourages us to participate. How you work also enables diversity; flexible work arrangements create more opportunities to bring people into the workforce.
• Encouraging Communication: This isn't just about ensuring we all have a voice but about encouraging collaboration. If we share problems, we create connections and networks of expertise that can help us be more robust when the unexpected comes up.
• Empowering Your Teams: Possibly the most obvious, but organizational citizenship empowers employees to act on the company’s behalf. We fostered this during lockdowns with various programs run by employees and that culture continues now.
• Providing Clarity: It's critical to give everyone clear parameters for decision-making. Resilient organizations enable employees to make decisions quickly by being clear on policies and responsibilities.
These are some of the ways organizational leaders can help employees become more resilient as individuals, but the question then becomes: How do you know when you've succeeded in encouraging this culture? Aside from the academic research that points to a direct correlation between financial performance and resilience, there should be equal emphasis on the social contract that an organization is building with employees. If employees buy into the approach, they're more likely to be emotionally invested in the vision and strategy, which means they're more likely to volunteer to take on responsibilities.
A good measure of resilience is ensuring individuals have the stamina (or motivation) to keep going. Let’s face it: The challenges are going to keep coming, so it's crucial we reward and recognize commitment and do everything possible to equip individuals with the skills to be more resilient. After all, resilience isn't just for the next crisis—it should be the foundation of how you build a strong, agile and healthy organization.

IGN has published a lengthy look at a new lawsuit that’s been filed against Destiny 2 developer Bungie, one where a former HR manager says that first, her recommendations about potential racial issues at the company were ignored and then she was ultimately let go a short while after raising those concerns.
The lawsuit is over wrongful termination and retaliation, the plaintiff Ingrid Alm being hired in May of 2022 as an HR manager.
The alleged course of events she lays out is as follows:
Alm was told to investigate the performance of a specific employee, called “James Smith” to protect anonymity. Smith told Alm that he was the only black employee on a team of 50, and felt he was being singled out by a supervisor.
Alm recommended Smith’s supervisor receive sensitivity training, a request met with “hostility and denial” citing the supervisor’s length of tenure and reputation at the company.
Then, Bungie allegedly said that Smith should be terminated, Alm argued this would be racial bias.
Alm’s supervisor was allegedly extremely angry that she had reached out to Bungie’s DEI, Dr. Courtney Benjamin, for advice on the issue, and then in September, Alm found herself abruptly fired.
In short, the story she alleges is that she perceived potential racial bias on a team, recommended its leader for sensitivity training, was reprimanded for the suggestion and ultimately fired. Hence the lawsuit.
The Seattle-based Bungie is very public about being a progressive, inclusive company, though IGN published a previous report citing issues within the workplace, including toxic culture producing sexism and inequality.
Bungie routinely announces diversity and inclusion initiatives, including a number of groups within Bungie meant to support its diverse employees, Black at Bungie, Trans at Bungie, etc. Though this same week, Bungie came under fire for announcing Latin at Bungie while employing the word “Latinx,” a controversial term that much of the Hispanic population does not like, viewing it as an outside modification of their language meant to serve supposedly progressive ends. Bungie left the tweet up, never addressing its thousands of angry replies and quote tweets, often hiding complaints about the Latinx term being used. There was a mix of real anger, but also some right-wing agitators celebrating that the openly progressive Bungie had found itself in this mess.
The HR lawsuit arrived a few days later. The allegations within are serious, and run counter to Bungie’s public-facing statements of inclusion. Even if that is indeed the overall goal of the company, it appears there may be many internal issues that remain within the company, and this one escalated to the point of an actual lawsuit.
I’ve reached out to Bungie for comment and will update if I hear back. It’s not known when and how this case will progress forward, but I will be following updates as they come.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurabegleybloom/2023/10/06/monsoon-journey-a-wellness-retreat-in-india/,Monsoon Journey: A Wellness Retreat In India,"I woke up to see the sun shining, and my heart dropped. Normally, during a vacation, sun is a good thing. But when you’ve come all the way to India to experience the monsoon, all you want is rain.
On my first visit to India 23 years ago, I stayed at an Ayurvedic spa in the Himalayas. One of the things that the Ayurvedic doctor told me was that going to a spa is better during the annual monsoon. Something about the heavy rains helps calm the soul and allows the body to be most receptive to the benefits of treatments. I added it to my bucket list.
Finally, the time had come to experience India during the monsoon. My destination: Six Senses Vana, a wellness retreat set in the foothills of the Himalayas. My motivation: to take my mom on a mother-daughter trip of a lifetime to celebrate her 80th birthday. It was a remarkable milestone that held even more significance considering the recent passing of my father. In the wake of my dad’s death, my mother channeled her grief into a mission of transformation, focusing on improving her overall health and well-being. So bringing her on a bucket-list wellness journey seemed like the perfect way to celebrate 80 years on earth and help set her up for many more years fueled by health and well-being.

We chose Six Senses Vana because the program has an array of activities designed to engage all the senses: yoga, meditation, fitness, sound therapy, wellness talks, the list goes on. I had heard from friends that it was truly transformative but not too radical for an 80-year-old. Included in the rate is a daily spa treatment that taps into healing modalities from around the world—from Ayurveda to Tibetan medicine to acupuncture—as well as healthy cuisine and clothing to wear during your stay. Plus, it’s not far from Rishikesh, which is one of the world’s holiest cities as well as the birthplace of yoga.
Getting here was quite an odyssey: We took connecting flights from New York through London to Delhi, then had a five-hour drive to Dehradun, where the property is located. We could have saved time if we had flown directly to Delhi and taken a connecting flight to the Rishikesh airport, but the flights through London were considerably cheaper (and an Indian friend of mine also advised that doing the connecting flight would help break up the long trip). I loved the drive—we were able to see the vastness of the Indian countryside and passed through vibrant small towns along the way.

The moment we arrived at Six Senses Vana, I felt an immediate sense of tranquility. Named after the surrounding forest, Vana offers not just physical nourishment and holistic rejuvenation but also a spiritual connection to nature. Taking refuge in the forest is an important part of Indian culture, and for many years, Vana had been a privately owned sanctuary for rebalancing and healing. In January 2023, the pioneering global wellness brand Six Senses took over the management, infusing their expertise into every aspect of the retreat.
The staff’s warm approach made us feel instantly at home. They explained the philosophy and the rules (no cellphones in any public spaces, for instance). We were given a blessing and presented with a wooden bracelet made from sandalwood, which is believed to bring emotional balance.

In our room, we changed into loose-fitting white kurta pajamas that the property provides, along with an optional light-colored shawl and a sustainably produced linen tote. Every guest wears this outfit throughout the stay, and while I initially felt a bit awkward (I’m a New Yorker who always wears black), there was something calming about seeing all the other guests wearing the same clothing. It puts everyone on a level playing field and helps shift the focus inward. I was also surprised by how much I appreciated not having to decide what to wear every day.
Immediately, we were whisked off to the wellness center, where I had a Tibetan “ku nye” massage that uses an ancient blend of therapeutic oils. The aim: to reduce mental stress and ease lethargy. My mother had a Swedish massage that is said to improve circulation and soothe the nervous system. They were deeply relaxing—the perfect introduction to our journey.

At dinner that night at Salana restaurant, the dining team talked us through Vana’s approach to balanced eating. Meals are meticulously crafted to balance your doshas, but guests also have the freedom to choose—within limits. I wanted to order the chicken tikka with roasted pepper appetizer, followed by the stir-fried prawns with beans, carrots, bok choy and coriander. But this was discouraged: Mixing seafood and protein isn’t great for gut health. And while the property allows you to order wine, mom and I had decided to embrace healthy living and abstain. But the watermelon, mint and parsley juice? Cold drinks aren’t recommended in the evening. Instead, the staff suggested a glass of warm water to prepare for sleep.
“Our cuisine is an extension of wellness and the basic objective is to create balance and nourishment,” Rajesh Sharma, the executive chef, told us. “The menus stay with the season. We use hyper-local ingredients. And we cook from scratch—we even make our own apple cider vinegar.” According to Sharma, it’s rare that you’ll ever sample the same dish twice. Sharma and his team have created a vast library of more than 1,738 dishes, with vegetarian, vegan and meat-based options. The cuisine is mostly centered around Indian flavors but there are also influences and options from around the world, from China to Italy.

But back to the monsoon—one of the major reasons we were here. When we woke up the next day, I was expecting to see rain, heavy rain—but there was the sun, peeking through the clouds and casting a shadow of doubt on my dream of experiencing the monsoon. We started the day with wellness consultations and screenings with Ayurvedic doctors, who mapped out each of our individual plans, combining detox, sleep, weight management and more, all customized to our needs.
During lunch at Anayu, the thali restaurant, we enjoyed a tasting meal tailored to our doshas. And then, the sky began to change. Dark clouds gathered, and the first raindrop hit the ground, followed by another and another. The monsoon had arrived, and as we stepped outside, the rain felt like a gentle embrace, almost as if nature herself was welcoming us.
A yoga session. Laura Begley Bloom
As the monsoon showers continued over the next few days, so did our transformational journey. Reflexology guided by a master practitioner left us feeling grounded and balanced. Sound therapy led by skilled musicians with bells and flutes transported us to a state of deep relaxation. The private spa treatments—from an Ayurvedic massage done with two masseuses to a facial infused with 24-karat gold—pampered us in ways we hadn’t imagined.
Every yoga session, meditation hour and cooking lesson felt like stepping stones toward renewal. As my mother and I participated in the retreat’s activities together, I could feel our spirits rekindling, our skin literally glowing with newfound vitality. On top of that, the raindrops from the monsoon seemed to cleanse not only the earth but also our souls, washing away the weight of grief and loss.
“The monsoon season at Six Senses Vana is a time of profound transformation—when your body is more receptive. It’s a time to clear out the old and bring in the new,” Dr. Jitendra Varshney, the wellness director, told me. He explained that during this season, herbs penetrate the body in a deeper way, purification improves and it’s more detoxifying. “You can achieve any health goal and feel more balanced.”

We met other guests, each with their own unique stories. There was Preeti, a 60-year-old Indian woman from Delhi, who had embarked on her own journey of self-discovery—her first-ever solo trip. She shared how the monsoon was a time of personal renewal and how she had come here to find herself.
A father and son duo from Italy were back for their second trip to Six Senses Vana, and they spoke about the retreat as a place where generational bonds strengthened amid the monsoon’s healing embrace. “It’s good for the body—and the mind,” the dad told me.
A group of young women from Uzbekistan on a girlfriend getaway found solace in the shared experience of rejuvenation and self-care. They laughed (quietly), they meditated and they found a deeper connection with one another as they navigated their individual wellness journeys.
An Australian woman who lives in London was here to mend after the end of a long relationship. It was part of a bigger Eat, Pray, Love-style expedition; before coming to Vana, she had been in Bali.

Six Senses Vana’s commitment to sustainability is also woven throughout the experience. This was the first retreat in India to be LEEDS certified back in 2015. On sustainability tours, guests can explore the property’s green initiatives, from water-saving technologies to waste reduction practices. Vana has planted more than 10,000 trees in the area. There are also upcycling workshops where guests can make paper out of recycled materials, for instance. It was inspiring to witness a wellness retreat so committed to preserving the natural beauty that surrounds it. “If you take care of nature, nature will take care of you,” explained Dr. Varshney.

Another highlight was visiting Rishikesh, where we had a puja (a blessing) with a Hindu priest along the shores of the sacred Ganges river. We lit candles and prayed and made offerings to the river and asked for a blessing over my mother in honor of her 80th birthday and the soul of my father. It was deeply moving. Later, we watched the nightly Aarti, a fire offering to the river that’s held at sunset. As monks from the local temple held up elaborate flaming candelabras and the crowd sang devotional songs, the rain came down in heavy sheets. We were soaked to the bone, but we didn’t mind at all—it was a beautiful experience.

When it came time to leave Six Senses Vana, the staff said their goodbyes and tied a red string around each of our wrists to symbolize long life. I reflected on the journey we had shared. The monsoon had done its magic, but the retreat had been the catalyst for something even more profound—a reconnection of body and spirit, a bond between a mother and daughter and a celebration of life’s precious moments. As we left the retreat, I knew that this experience would forever hold a special place in our hearts, a reminder of transformation and strength and the enduring power of love.

The state of our economy presents a lot of challenges for both businesses and consumers, and many small businesses are looking for ways to drive more operational efficiencies to offset the impact of inflation and continue to grow. Artificial intelligence (AI) is one solution that both businesses and consumers are leveraging every day, yet the debate remains around adoption, understanding, and value of it.
Awareness of AI and machine learning is growing. A recent Prosper Insights & Analytics survey shows that the majority of U.S. business owners and Adults 18+ surveyed have heard of ChatGPT, and that business owners are actually most excited to use it in comparison to the consumer audience surveyed.
Prosper - Heard of ChatGBT Prosper Insights & Analytics
How can small businesses capitalize on advanced technologies to catapult growth? AI can help businesses perform a variety of functions, such as automated tasks, create predictive insights, and personalize experiences. Most importantly, these can help tackle some of the biggest small business challenges - like cash flow.
To better understand how small business owners plan to leverage AI to tackle these challenges, we spoke with Kelly Vincent, vice-president & mid-market segment leader at Intuit where she focuses on helping drive small business success through the QuickBooks platform. Today, the platform focuses on providing small businesses with the connected tools, expert services, and insights businesses need at every stage of growth.
Gary Drenik: What are the top macroeconomic headwinds that small businesses are facing?
Kelly Vincent: Inflation continues to be the top external challenge small businesses currently face. A recent Prosper Insights & Analytics survey found 57% of U.S. business owners and 62.5% of U.S. adults surveyed think inflation is negatively impacting the overall economy. Inflation has a big impact on small business cash flow, which also remains a key reason they fail.

Despite today’s challenging macroeconomic landscape, a recent QuickBooks survey revealed the majority of businesses (73%) are prioritizing AI, financial technologies, and expanding e-commerce solutions with an average investment of $45,000 to $142,000 in technology tools to help drive growth and success - up an average of $10,000 from 2022.
There is a massive opportunity for small businesses to benefit from AI, especially as they need to do more with less in today’s economy.
Drenik: How should small businesses address the challenges associated with growing and managing their businesses?
Vincent: Our customer research shows that as businesses grow or adapt to a new environment, they face several challenges. Top challenges include managing finances and accounting in a scalable, automated way that doesn’t “time sink” the team given time is their most precious resource, managing quote to cash, and finding more time to engage with customers. For the 35% of small business owners surveyed who identified a lack of time as a top challenge, AI can be a game-changer.
But growth can mean different things to different business owners. For some, growth means increasing sales and revenue, for others it means reaching new customers or expanding their team. The first step is to identify and prioritize what area to address first.
Customer acquisition is a primary concern for many business owners impacted by today’s economy and as a result, the majority are turning to e-commerce technology to expand their reach and drive sales. In 2022, more than half of businesses that experienced growth say they invested in e-commerce technology (54%) and nearly 9 in 10 business owners (89%) say they are selling or plan to sell on at least one e-commerce platform this year. Investing in e-commerce technology is not only important but will help small businesses drive growth.
Drenik: What are the top investments small and midsized businesses should consider to ensure their success and catapult their growth?
Vincent: Small and midsized business owners should focus on simplifying financial operations, automating low-level tasks, and streamlining communications. Investing in technologies that can help with these three things will help put them on the right path.
Another consideration for a small business is where, when, and how much to invest in technology. More than 7 in 10 small business owners say they invested in technology last year, spending over $35,000 on digital tools on average. And it paid off. 95% of these business owners claim those investments increased operational efficiency, increased sales, and provided better financial and employee management. Meanwhile, other business owners invested in tools this past year that they didn’t understand or use properly, and some reported overspending or even scrapping the technology entirely. Business owners should invest in tools that serve them at their current stage of growth but can also grow with them.
Drenik: How can AI help small businesses manage their growth?
Vincent: AI cannot replace the strategic and creative work that business owners and employees contribute, but it can play a central role in streamlining operations and performing low-level, time-consuming tasks to free up time for more demanding, critical work like developing customer relationships and creating more products and services. Luckily, there are many established and reliable ways businesses can use AI for both long- and short-term business benefits.
Business owners can leverage AI to manage their growth by automating business operations and gaining better visibility into financial performance. The QuickBooks survey shows 51% of business owners want to automate payroll. Similarly, a recent Prosper Insights & Analytics survey shows a 3 percentage point increase year-over-year of business owners planning to purchase payroll services. Payroll tools powered by AI can help business owners as they grow their workforce.
Prosper - Company Planning on Purchasing Payroll Services Prosper Insights & Analytics
AI can also be used to help with marketing and content creation, analyzing customer trends and behaviors, and customer service support, which our survey shows are the most common AI-based tools business owners plan to adopt. AI can rapidly learn about the customer and create a personalized machine learning model for a business with very little work needed from the user.
On another note, at QuickBooks we often see small business owners start to explore AI-based tools and not give them enough time or input to produce quality results. Good data creates good results from AI, and if a business isn’t able to input proper data and requests, the model won’t be able to give them the results they’re looking for, which can lead to frustration and owners quickly deciding AI isn’t for them before giving it a true chance. AI depends on accurate information and proper data and small businesses that recognize this detail will benefit from the innovative capabilities AI has to offer.
Drenik: What are the most common functions that small business owners should seek to automate?
Vincent: Automation is a gift that keeps on giving to small businesses. When starting a business, many entrepreneurs manually track and monitor day-to-day operations. As specific tasks become more complex as a business grows, it’s important to start automating them.
Many small business owners use or plan to adopt AI tools for automating low-level tasks and financial workstreams like managing cash flow. Other tasks like expense management (69%), invoicing (68%), and running financial health reports (47%) are a few of the most common functions business owners wish to automate with the help of AI-powered tools.
When planning to implement AI to streamline workflows, small business owners should look closely at their processes and identify specific functions that AI can manage.
Gary Drenik: Thank you, Kelly, for your insights on how AI can play a significant role in the growth of small businesses and how technology solutions like QuickBooks can help foster this growth. I’m looking forward to seeing how AI will impact the success of small businesses, and our broader economy.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/651c5199abc84b329b315541/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=1200,2023-10-06 10:00:00

Don’t worry—this article will only take a few minutes to read. Why the caveat? Because it seems we’ve never been more obsessed with our apparent lack of time and how to make the most of it. While tl,dr—“too long, didn’t read”—has become a stock response on the internet, there’s no shortage of tips for using our time better, from the Pomodoro technique to Inbox Zero.
Meanwhile, a quick look at the bestsellers on Amazon suggests we’re living through a golden age of time management. There’s Time Management Magic, Time Management for the Overwhelmed, Time Management From the Inside Out, The Time Management Solution and—if none of that’s to your taste—Calling Bullsh*t on Busy: A Practical Guide to the Time Management Myth and Quickly Achieving Your Goals.
My advice? Skip them all and pick up the latest version of a technology that first rolled off factory floors about two hundred years ago. I’m talking, of course, about the humble bicycle. Now, you probably know that the bicycle is great for physical and mental health, that commuting by bike instead of by car once a day slashes your transport-related carbon footprint by 67%, and that switching from cars to bicycles cuts emissions much faster than switching to electric cars.
Car-Clogged Cities
But time is short, so I’ll cut to the chase. Nothing beats a bicycle when it comes to saving time. First of all, there’s commuting time. Simply put, when we sit in traffic, we lose time. The longer we sit in traffic, the more time we lose. And, as Benjamin Franklin put it, time is money. In other words, tailbacks and traffic jams literally make us poorer. In fact, cities in Southeast Asia lose between two and five percent of their annual GDP to congestion, with Manila, the capital of the Philippines, losing $67 million per day.
Yet if there’s one point that often gets lost in the “bikes v. cars” debate, it’s that bikes are faster than cars in city centres and save us time. According to a report by New York City’s Department of Transportation, people using the city’s bike-sharing scheme travel about 30% faster than those in automobiles, while New York state legislators are proposing making e-bikes more affordable, on the grounds that they reduce traffic by 30 minutes—a lifetime in New York City.
Likewise, a study reported by Scientific American found that driving speeds during peak commuting hours in Austin, Cincinnati and Los Angeles were 6, 9 and 8 mph respectively. In car-clogged cities like New Delhi, the average driving speed is 3 mph. By comparison, the average cycling speed in a city like Copenhagen is 10 mph, while in cities with relatively little bike traffic, it’s around 11-12 mph.
What’s more, in our ever-more populated cities, bikes can be more economically efficient than other vehicles. A recent study in the UK found that electric cargo bikes deliver about 60% faster than vans in city centres. In fact, bikes had a higher average speed and dropped off 10 parcels an hour, compared with six for vans.
Time Hygiene
Here’s the thing, though. Bicycles are even faster than cars when we consider not just the actual travel time but the amount of time we spend working to afford each vehicle. Though it might take a car 20 minutes to cover a 10 km commute, compared to 33 minutes on a bike, the average cost of the car, including the initial cost and maintenance, is equal to 40 minutes of work for every 10 kilometers covered, compared to just six minutes for the bike.
In other words, cars are not as “time hygienic” as bikes. Time hygiene is the idea that at every stage of its existence in its owner’s life—from the moment she started working to earn money to buy it, to the time it shaves off her commute, to its maintenance—the bicycle optimizes her time more than any other form of transport.
How we choose to get around the cities of the future, then, isn’t just a matter of health and the environment. Time hygiene should be a part of the argument for making our cities more liveable and our planet more inhabitable, too. As Steve Jobs put it: “The most precious resource we all have is time.” Indeed, wasting time is nothing less than an existential tragedy. Life would be better if we could spend less time in traffic and more time doing things we enjoy—or thinking, working and generating more wealth.
Tech On Track
In that light, technology has a major role to play—and an incentive to do so. From bike racks at Google to in-house mechanics at Etsy, the tech world has a long legacy of leading from the front. And with good reason. Companies like Foursquare discovered long ago that having a bike-friendly culture can spur innovation. In other words, encouraging more cycling is a win-win.
So, what could tech firms and CTOs do today? Simple. They could help develop technology that improves cycling and encourages more people to do it—such as easier-to-use bike-sharing schemes, more energy-efficient e-bikes, or bicycles and cycling infrastructure that better embraces or incorporates AI, IT and the Internet of Things.
Tech wizards could also turn their skills and experience to making cities safer and better for bicycles—like developing “smart” bike lanes that track the flow of commuting cyclists and change the traffic lights from red to green to keep the peloton moving. And decision-makers in the C-suite could introduce financial incentives to encourage more employees to cycle to work.
More imaginatively still, it means designing ways to move more and more cyclists around our ever-more vertical cities. Think airport-style travelators, Hong Kong-style escalators or “bike lanes in the sky.” Sound far-fetched? Maybe. Still, the only thing we have to lose is time.

[+] the US Capitol in Washington, DC, on September 13, 2023. (Photo by Stefani Reynolds / AFP) (Photo by STEFANI REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images
Elon Musk has a new vision for Twitter (X), a “cleaner” looking timeline, one with less stuff on it, even if that means sacrificing basic functionality or usability in the process. First, it was headlines, now it’s deleting all visible frontpage feed data for replies, retweets and likes.
This past week, Musk followed through on a promise to delete embedded headlines and lede copy from posted article links, leaving behind only an image with a little URL in the bottom corner. One benefit, he said, was a cleaner look, another, his acolytes touted, was less clickbait headlines.
Of course in practice, the opposite is true. You can now write anything at all in the text of a post and link to a story that says something else entirely, because that context is not embedded in the tweet anymore, at least on the app itself (embeds may still not have caught up)
And when you’re not trolling, outside of authors manually writing (real) headlines themselves in tweets, really no one who shares that link is going to take the time to do that, so it makes links close to pointless now, decreasing already bad clickthrough rates on Twitter. This reflects a previously stated desire to get people to stay on Twitter rather than click away to outside sources. Musk says instead, articles should be written directly on Twitter, something no news outlet or website will actually do.
In case that wasn’t enough, Musk has now said in a subscriber-only post that he plans to also delete the numbers of replies, retweets and likes on posts shown in the timeline, leaving only “view count,” the pointless metric he himself added, instead. His quote, including the recent URL change:
“Those ugly URL cards with repetitive text were making my eyes bleed. So much better now!”
“Next, we’ll remove all the action buttons with their superfluous interaction counts from the main timeline. Just view count will show, unless you tap into a post. This will greatly improve readability.”
It’s not clear if he’s saying just the numbers will be removed, or the numbers and the literal buttons, but either case makes the site worse. You will have no clue if a tweet you’re seeing has gone mega-viral or has three likes on it. I also firmly believe this is another attempt to hide people who get “ratioed,” ie. tweets with far more replies or quote tweets than likes, many of which are…Twitter Blue-having Musk fanboys, or often conservative commentators on the more liberal-skewing site. He already hid quote tweets between two or three clicks, and this is just the next step.
It is also likely that a goal of this is to increase interaction and “engagement” on the site, however artificially. When this change is made, to see the larger context of a tweet and its actual reply/retweet/like data, you’ll have to click into it. So that’s now two impressions plus an actual interaction, as opposed to just one impression previously. That will goose Twitter’s numbers, and Musk’s beloved “view count” he frequently touts. Maybe he does believe all this is helping “readability” but it’s also altering UI elements to serve Twitter’s own ends, whether it’s causing less click-outs via links, or artificially generating more interactions by hiding data.
At this point, it’s impossible to predict what Musk does next with the site. Tweets now scroll sideways. Only Twitter Blue subscribers can use punctuation marks. You never know at this point.

A team of New York University computer scientists has created a neural network that can explain how it reaches its predictions. The work reveals what accounts for the functionality of neural networks—the engines that drive artificial intelligence and machine learning—thereby illuminating a process that has largely been concealed from users.
The breakthrough centers on a specific usage of neural networks that has become popular in recent years—tackling challenging biological questions. Among these are examinations of the intricacies of RNA splicing—the focal point of the study—which plays a role in transferring information from DNA to functional RNA and protein products.
""Many neural networks are black boxes—these algorithms cannot explain how they work, raising concerns about their trustworthiness and stifling progress into understanding the underlying biological processes of genome encoding,"" says Oded Regev, a computer science professor at NYU's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences and the senior author of the paper, which was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
""By harnessing a new approach that improves both the quantity and the quality of the data for machine-learning training, we designed an interpretable neural network that can accurately predict complex outcomes and explain how it arrives at its predictions.""
Regev and the paper's other authors, Susan Liao, a faculty fellow at the Courant Institute, and Mukund Sudarshan, a Courant doctoral student at the time of the study, created a neural network based on what is already known about RNA splicing.
Specifically, they developed a model—the data-driven equivalent of a high-powered microscope—that allows scientists to trace and quantify the RNA splicing process, from input sequence to output splicing prediction.
""Using an 'interpretable-by-design' approach, we've developed a neural network model that provides insights into RNA splicing—a fundamental process in the transfer of genomic information,"" notes Regev. ""Our model revealed that a small, hairpin-like structure in RNA can decrease splicing.""
The researchers confirmed the insights their model provides through a series of experiments. These results showed a match with the model's discovery: Whenever the RNA molecule folded into a hairpin configuration, splicing was halted, and the moment the researchers disrupted this hairpin structure, splicing was restored.

As an integral part of its technological agenda, Russia is developing its own production of lithium-ion batteries. Despite the vast lithium reserves, battery production volumes fall short of the demand. Of special relevance is the development of high-energy-density batteries for electric cars. This challenge is addressed by both industry and science.
In their new paper, researchers from Skoltech, in collaboration with colleagues from France, China, and other countries, are the first to reveal the roles of cobalt and nickel in the electrochemical properties of cathode materials. The research is published in the journal Nature Materials.
Today's lithium-ion batteries use layered oxides of lithium, nickel, manganese, and cobalt as the active materials of the positive electrode (cathode). As nickel, manganese, and cobalt belong to the same category of 3D transition metals, their electronic structure and chemical properties are similar. They are homogeneously distributed within the crystal structure of layered oxides, which makes it very difficult to distinguish between their roles in the electrochemical properties of the cathode material.
To distinguish between the roles of nickel and cobalt, the researchers obtained two model compounds—a lithium-nickel-manganese oxide and a lithium-cobalt-manganese oxide—and closely examined their structure, composition, and electrochemical properties. A comprehensive investigation of these systems using various kinds of spectroscopy, electrochemical tests, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy has enabled the team to compare the two layered oxides in terms of their local atomic structure, its evolution over the course of battery operation, and the interplay between the observable characteristics and mechanical stress, lithium intercalation and deintercalation, redox kinetics, etc.

""We conducted the study using the unique equipment of Skoltech's Advanced Imaging Core Facility. It enabled us to examine the atomic structure of the materials for lithium-ion batteries. The goal was to collect data on how the local crystal structure of the materials evolves during battery operation. Such an investigation requires ultimate precision and rigor in preparing the sample, operating the equipment, and interpreting the data,"" said Anatolii Morozov, a co-author of the study and a junior research scientist at the Skoltech Center for Energy Science and Technology.
""We examined our findings with our colleagues from College de France, analyzing not just transmission electron microscopy data, but also X-ray diffraction and spectroscopy data, as well as electrochemical measurements. Finally, we came up with a table summarizing the results and highlighting the advantages and the drawbacks of the cobalt- and nickel-based cathode materials. These data will be used to optimize cathode material compositions for high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries for electric cars,"" said a co-author of the study, Professor Artem Abakumov, who heads the Center for Energy Science and Technology at Skoltech.
The study is part of a project concerned with the creation of promising electrochemical energy storage systems by means of directional design of the local structure and microstructure of electrode materials. Led by Professor Artem Abakumov, the scientists working on this project are developing the fundamentals for the design of high-capacity electrode materials and solid electrolytes to create the next generation of high-energy-density electrochemical energy storage systems.
The results of the project will contribute to implementing a national roadmap concerned with furthering the production and use of electric vehicles in Russia, which spans the period until 2030 and envisions the development of a domestic EV production.

Gripper behavior and performance. Credit: Korea Institute of Science and Technology
Utilizing soft, flexible materials such as cloth, paper, and silicone, soft robotic grippers act like a robot's hand to perform functions such as safely grasping and releasing objects. Unlike conventional rigid material grippers, they are more flexible and safe, and are being researched for household robots that handle fragile objects such as eggs, or for logistics robots that need to carry various types of objects. However, its low load capacity makes it difficult to lift heavy objects, and its poor grasping stability makes it easy to lose the object even under mild external impact.
Dr. Song, Kahye of the Intelligent Robotics Research Center at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), along with Professor Lee, Dae-Young of the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), have jointly developed a soft gripper with a woven structure that can grip objects weighing more than 100 kg with 130 grams of material.
The results of the study were published on August 2 in Nature Communications .
To increase the loading capacity of the soft robot gripper, the research team applied a new structure inspired by textiles, as opposed to the conventional method of developing new materials or reinforcing the structure.
The weaving technique they focused on involves tightly intertwining individual threads to create a strong fabric, which can reliably support heavy objects and has been used for centuries in clothing, bags, and industrial textiles. The team used thin PET plastic. The grippers were designed to allow the strips to intertwine and unwind into a woven structure.

The resulting woven gripper weighs 130 grams and can grip an object weighing 100 kilograms. Conventional grippers of the same weight can lift no more than 20 kilograms at most, and considering that a gripper that can lift the same weight weighs 100 kilograms, the team succeeded in increasing the load capacity relative to its own weight.
Also, the soft robot gripper developed by the research team uses plastic, which costs only a few thousand won (approx. $2) per unit of material, and can be used as a universal gripper that can grip objects of various shapes and weights, making it highly competitive in price. In addition, since the soft robot gripper can be manufactured by simply fastening a plastic strip, the manufacturing process can be completed in less than 10 minutes, and it is easy to replace and maintain, so the process efficiency is excellent.
In addition to PET, which is the main material used by the research team, the gripper can also be made of various materials such as rubber and compounds that possess elasticity, allowing the team to customize and utilize grippers suitable for industrial and logistics sites that require strong gripping performance or various environments that need to withstand extreme conditions.

""The woven structure gripper developed by KIST and KAIST has the strengths of a soft robot but can grasp heavy objects at the level of a rigid gripper,"" said Dr. Song.

At issue is RISC-V, pronounced “risk five,” an open-source technology that competes with costly proprietary technology from British semiconductor and software design company Arm Holdings. RISC-V can be used as a key ingredient for anything from a smartphone chip to advanced processors for artificial intelligence.
Some lawmakers - including two Republican House of Representatives committee chairmen, Republican Senator Marco Rubio and Democratic Senator Mark Warner - are urging Biden’s administration to take action regarding RISC-V, citing national security grounds.
The lawmakers expressed concerns that Beijing is exploiting a culture of open collaboration among American companies to advance its own semiconductor industry, which could erode the current U.S. lead in the chip field and help China modernize its military. Their comments represent the first major effort to put constraints on work by U.S. companies on RISC-V.
Representative Mike Gallagher, chairman of the House select committee on China, said in a statement to Reuters that the Commerce Department needs to “require any American person or company to receive an export license prior to engaging with PRC (People’s Republic of China) entities on RISC-V technology.”
Such calls to regulate RISC-V are the latest in the U.S.-China battle over chip technology that escalated last year with sweeping export restrictions that the Biden administration has told China it will update this month.
“The CCP (Chinese Communist Party) is abusing RISC-V to get around U.S. dominance of the intellectual property needed to design chips. U.S. persons should not be supporting a PRC tech transfer strategy that serves to degrade U.S. export control laws,” Representative Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement to Reuters.
McCaul said he wants action from the Bureau of Industry and Security, the part of the Commerce Department that oversees export-control regulations, and would pursue legislation if that does not materialize.
The bureau “is constantly reviewing the technology landscape and threat environment, and continually assessing how best to apply our export control policies to protect national security and safeguard core technologies,” a Commerce Department spokesperson said in a statement.
“Communist China is developing open-source chip architecture to dodge our sanctions and grow its chip industry,” Rubio said in a statement to Reuters. “If we don’t broaden our export controls to include this threat, China will one day surpass us as the global leader in chip design.”
“I fear that our export-control laws are not equipped to deal with the challenge of open-source software - whether in advanced semiconductor designs like RISC-V or in the area of AI - and a dramatic paradigm shift is needed,” Warner said in a statement to Reuters.
RISC-V is overseen by a Swiss-based nonprofit foundation that coordinates efforts among for-profit companies to develop the technology.
The RISC-V technology came from labs at the University of California, Berkeley, and later benefited from funding by the Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Its creators have compared it to Ethernet, USB and even the internet, which are freely available and draw on contributions from around the world to make innovation faster and cheaper.
HUAWEI TECHNOLOGIES
Executives from China’s Huawei Technologies have embraced RISC-V as a pillar of that nation’s progress in developing its own chips. But the United States and its allies also have jumped on the technology, with chip giant Qualcomm working with a group of European automotive firms on RISC-V chips and Alphabet’s Google saying it will make Android, the world’s most popular mobile operating system, work on RISC-V chips.
Qualcomm declined to comment. Its executives said in August they believe RISC-V will speed up chip innovation and transform the tech industry.
Google did not respond to a request for comment.
If Biden’s administration were to regulate U.S. companies’ participation in the Swiss-based foundation in the manner lawmakers are seeking, the move could complicate how American and Chinese companies work together on open technical standards. It also could create hurdles for China’s pursuit of chip self-sufficiency, as well as for U.S. and European efforts to create cheaper and more versatile chips.
Jack Kang, vice president of business development at SiFive, a Santa Clara, California-based startup using RISC-V, said potential U.S. government restrictions on American companies regarding RISC-V would be a “tremendous tragedy.”
“It would be like banning us from working on the internet,” Kang said. “It would be a huge mistake in terms of technology, leadership, innovation and companies and jobs that are being created.”
Regulating the open discussion of technologies is rarer than regulating physical products, but not impossible, said Kevin Wolf, an export-control attorney at law firm Akin Gump who served in the Commerce Department under former President Barack Obama. Existing rules on chip exports could help provide a legal framework for such a proposal, Wolf said.",https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20231006&t=2&i=1646885122&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEJ950D2,2023-10-06 10:50:41

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A former executive at Samsung Electronics’ venture capital arm who proposed that mobile app developer Branch Metrics’ software offering be expanded in Samsung smartphones faced pushback due to pressure from Google, he said on Thursday in a landmark antitrust trial against the Alphabet unit.
Patrick Chang, who worked at Samsung Next to invest in innovative companies, had urged the parent company to expand the offerings of Branch, which can search within apps, to its Android smartphones.
Branch Metrics founder and former CEO Alexander Austin testified in late September that his company eliminated some of its software’s functions to fend off Google’s complaints as it sought to make deals with wireless carriers and smartphone makers. Branch had to ensure that its searches remained within apps and never linked to the web, Austin noted.
Chang testified that Samsung also faced pushback from wireless carries, like AT&T, which sell Android phones.
Google is accused of paying $10 billion a year based on revenue share agreements to smartphone makers like Samsung Electronics, wireless carriers and others who agree to make its software the default and maintain its monopoly in search.
In its questioning, the Justice Department showed an August 2020 email by Samsung executive David Eun, who complained that “Google is clearly buying its way to squelch competitors.”
Under cross examination by an attorney for Google, Chang was asked about another possible explanation for Samsung’s disinterest in Branch, which is that the software was clunky and few users clicked on links that Branch offered.
Chang testified during the fourth week of a more than two-month trial in which the U.S. Justice Department is seeking to show that Google abused its monopoly of search and some search advertising. Google has said that its business practices were legal.

https://www.reuters.com/innovation/article/britain-tech-regulation/uk-to-examine-amazon-and-microsofts-cloud-dominance-idUSKBN3150A7,UK to examine Amazon and Microsoft's cloud dominance,"LONDON (Reuters) -Britain’s media regulator on Thursday asked the country’s antitrust authority to investigate U.S. tech giants Amazon and Microsoft’s dominance of the UK cloud market.
Ofcom said it had identified features that made it more difficult for UK businesses to use multiple cloud suppliers.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft had a combined 70-80% share of Britain’s public cloud infrastructure services market in 2022, Ofcom said. Google was their closest competitor with 5-10%.
Britain is not the only country looking into cloud computing; the U.S. Federal Trade Commission asked for information about the market in March, citing similar interest in the UK, France, Japan, The Netherlands and South Korea.
“The CMA (Competition and Markets Authority) will now conduct an independent investigation to decide whether there is an adverse effect on competition, and if so, whether it should take action or recommend others to take action,” it said.
Amazon said it disagreed with Ofcom, whose findings were based on “a fundamental misconception of how the IT sector functions, and the services and discounts on offer”.
“Any unwarranted intervention could lead to unintended harm to IT customers and competition,” a spokesperson said.
But it said it would work constructively with the CMA.
Microsoft said it was committed to ensuring the UK cloud industry remained innovative and highly competitive. “We will engage constructively with the CMA,” a Microsoft spokesperson said.
Dan Ridsdale, TMT director at research company Edison, said the dominance of AWS, Microsoft and to a lesser extent Google was replicated across every major economy other than China.
But Britain was the most advanced in addressing the issue, he said, and was now on a path to potentially taking action.

“Other jurisdictions are likely to follow suit and regulatory action of one form or another looks inevitable,” he said.
The French antitrust authority said in June that practices in the sector could potentially restrict competition, while the EU regulator is scrutinising Microsoft’s cloud practices following a complaint by trade group Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe (CISPE) whose members include Amazon.
MICROSOFT-CMA HISTORY
The CMA and Microsoft have already clashed this year when the regulator blocked the company’s $69 billion acquisition of games company Activision Blizzard.
A restructured deal found favour but the episode made clear the CMA’s willingness to take on big tech.
Ofcom said in April it was worried about the practices of AWS and Microsoft because of their market positions in the cloud market, and planned to ask the competition regulator to investigate.
Reuters reported on Tuesday that Ofcom was expected to push for an antitrust investigation.
UK businesses told Ofcom they were concerned it was too difficult to switch or mix and match cloud providers.
“So, we’re referring the market to the CMA for further scrutiny,” Ofcom Director Fergal Farragher said.
The CMA welcomed the move, saying effective competition in the 7.5 billion pound ($9.1 billion) UK market was essential.
Google Vice President Amit Zavery said Ofcom’s referral demonstrated the need to create an open cloud market with no vendor lock-in.

“UK government agencies, businesses, and consumers want to move easily across cloud platforms and choose which services best meet their needs,” he said, adding Google would continue to allow its products to run on any cloud without penalty.
The CMA will complete its investigation by April 2025.

BlackBerry joins a number of companies that have split their units in recent years, favoring a leaner corporate structure to help investors better evaluate their separate businesses.
Earlier this week, the packaged food giant formerly known as Kellogg Co completed its spinoff. Healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson and industrial conglomerate General Electric have also spun off some of their units.
“Both the IoT and Cyber businesses ... address large and growing market opportunities. This new proposed structure will further increase both their operational agility and ability to focus on delivering exceptional solutions,” said BlackBerry CEO John Chen.
U.S.-listed shares of Waterloo, Ontario-based BlackBerry rose more than 4% in trading after the bell. The shares have fallen more than 18% since Reuters reported in August that private equity firm Veritas Capital had made an offer to buy the company.
BlackBerry said in May it would consider strategic options for its portfolio of businesses that could include the possible separation of one or more of its businesses.
Last year, it pulled the plug on its smartphones business and has since been trying to sell its legacy patents related to its mobile devices.
The company went public in 1997 and soon became popular for its ubiquitous business smartphones, which were toted by executives, politicians and legions of fans in the early 2000s.
Last week, the company reported its second-quarter results and posted total revenue of $132 million, down from $168 million a year earlier.

The FT had previously reported Yaccarino was planning to meet with the seven banks that had helped to finance Elon Musk’s takeover of the social network — an acquisition that’s now under SEC investigation, as Musk allegedly violated securities laws by scooping up Twitter shares ahead of the acquisition.
In the time since his takeover, his controversial changes have spooked advertisers, as major brands pulled their ads after seeing their posts appear beside hate speech and pro-Nazi content. Reuters this week reported that X’s U.S. ad revenue has declined every month since Musk’s acquisition, with the latest figures showing a 60% year-over-year decline as of August.
In June, Yaccarino joined X (then Twiter) from NBCUniversal where she served as chairman of its advertising and partnerships group, with the goal of getting X’s ads business back on track. Those efforts are still underway, as Bloomberg’s report notes she also told the bankers that advertisers were returning to X, but with smaller budgets than before. She additionally noted the company would be cash-flow positive if not for the debt owed — a figure that’s now $13 billion. Bloomberg estimated that X also owes around $1.2 billion in interest payments on that debt per year.
It’s not clear if the three-tier approach to subscriptions Yaccarino spoke of would include the plan Musk recently introduced when he said that X would be moving to a model where everyone would need to pay a small fee for use of the platform. The X owner explained that charging everyone on the service was the only way to combat the “vast army of bots” X faces. In fact, Yaccarino seemed caught off guard by a question about that plan at the Code Conference last week, when asked how many users X might lose with such a change. Confused, the CEO asked the interviewer to repeat the question and then responded by asking if Musk had actually said that X was doing that, or was he “just thinking about it?”
The odd answer raised questions about how much Yaccarino was in charge of X’s business goals and objectives, while others showcased she didn’t have a solid grip on X’s numbers. For example, at one point during the interview, she said X had “200 to 250 [million]” daily active users, “something like that.” (X clarified to The Information after the fact that X had 245 million.) The two execs often seemed to not be in alignment on their figures, as Musk spoke of X’s 100-200 million posts per day just weeks ago, with Yaccarino this week saying the figure was 500 million. As it turns out, Yaccarino was referring to a combination of original posts, replies, quote posts, and reposts while Musk was only referencing original posts.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/twitter-x-logo-musk-2.jpg?resize=1200,675",2023-10-06 14:03:32

A person using generative AI — models that generate text, images, music and more given a prompt — could infringe on someone else’s copyright through no fault of their own. But who’s on the hook for the legal fees and damages if — or rather, when — that happens?
It depends.
In the fast-changing landscape of generative AI, companies monetizing the tech — from startups to big tech companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft — are approaching IP risks from very different angles.
Some vendors have pledged to defend, financially and otherwise, customers using their generative AI tools who end up on the wrong side of copyright litigation. Others have published policies to shield themselves from liability, leaving customers to foot the legal bills.
While the terms of service agreements for most generative AI tools are public, they’re written in legalese. Seeking some clarity, I reached out to vendors about their policies on protecting customers who might violate copyright with their AI-generated text, images, videos and music.
The responses — and non-responses — were enlightening.
Regurgitating data
Generative AI models “learn” from examples to craft essays and code, create artwork and compose music — and even write lyrics to accompany that music. They’re trained on millions to billions of ebooks, art pieces, emails, songs, audio clips, voice recordings and more, most of which came from public websites.
Some of these examples are in the public domain — at least in the case of vendors that trawl the web for training data. Others aren’t, or come under a restrictive license that requires citation or a specific forms of compensation.
The legality of vendors training on data without permission is another matter that’s being hashed out in the courts. But what might possibly land generative AI users in trouble is regurgitation, or when a generative model spits out a mirror copy of a training example.
Microsoft, GitHub and OpenAI are currently being sued in a class action motion that accuses them of violating copyright law by allowing Copilot, a code-generating AI, to regurgitate licensed code snippets without providing credit. Elsewhere, thousands of writers have signed an open letter decrying generative AI technologies that “mimic and regurgitate” their “language, stories, style and ideas.”
The cases keep coming.
Authors in California and New York have sued OpenAI for alleged IP theft of their works. Image-generating tool vendors including Stability AI and Midjourney are the subject of lawsuits brought by artists and stock image sites like Getty Images. And Universal Music Group is seeking to ban AI-generated music mimicking the style of musicians it represents from streaming platforms, sending takedown notices to have the songs removed.
Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that in a recent survey of Fortune 500 companies by Acrolinx, nearly a third said that intellectual property was their biggest concern about the use of generative AI.
The threat of running afoul of copyright with a generative AI tool hasn’t stopped investors from pouring billions into the startups creating those tools. One wonders, however, whether the situation will remain tenable for much longer.
A question of indemnity
In the midst of the uncertainty, you might think that generative AI vendors would stand behind their customers in the strongest terms — if for no other reason than to their allay their fears of IP-related legal challenges.
But you’d be wrong.
From the language in some terms of service agreements — specifically the indemnity clauses, or the clauses that specify in which cases customers can expect to be reimbursed for damages from third-party claims — it’s clear that not every vendor’s willing to chance a court decision forcing them to rethink their approach to generative model training, or in the worst case their business model.
Anthropic, for instance, which recently inked a deal with Amazon to raise as much as $4 billion and is reportedly seeking another $2 billion investment from Google and others, reserves the right to “hold harmless” itself and partners from damages arising from the use of its generative AI — including those related to IP.
Point blank, I asked Anthropic, which offers strictly text-generating models, whether it would legally or financially support a customer implicated in a copyright lawsuit over its models’ outputs. The company declined to say.
AI21 Labs, another well-funded generative AI startup building a suite of text editing tools, also declined to give an answer. So I looked at its policy.
A21 Labs says that it might “assume exclusive defense and control” of a lawsuit against a customer if the customer chooses not to defend or settle it themselves. But it won’t pay for the privilege; it’ll be at the customer’s own expense.
OpenAI — arguably the most successful generative AI vendor today, with over $10 billion in venture capital and revenue approaching $1 billion — pointed me to its terms of use, which limit the company’s liability to “the amount [a customer] paid for [an OpenAI] service that gave rise to [a] claim during the 12 months before the the liability arose or $100.” That’s the best-case scenario for customers; OpenAI’s policy makes it clear that the company, in many if not most cases, won’t be a party to or defend against copyright lawsuits targeting its users.
Vendors building image- and video-generating AI, where the potential copyright violations tend to be a bit more obvious, aren’t much more supportive contractually their text-first rivals.
Stability AI, which develops music-generating models in addition to image- and text-generating ones, referred me to the terms for its API. The company leaves it to customers to defend themselves against copyright claims and — unlike some other generative AI vendors — has no payout carve-out in the event that it’s found liable.
Midjourney and Runway.ai didn’t respond to my emails — but I found their terms. Midjourney’s policy releases the company from liability for third party IP damages. Runway.ai’s does as well.
Fine print
Now, some vendors — perhaps becoming more attuned to the concerns of enterprise customers considering adopting generative AI, or looking to position themselves as a “safer” alternative — aren’t shying away from committing to protecting customers in the event that they’re sued for copyright infringement. To a point.
Amazon, which recently launched a platform for running and fine-tuning generative AI models, called Bedrock, says that it’ll indemnify (i.e. defend) customers against claims alleging model outputs infringe on a third party’s IP rights. But Amazon’s indemnification policy only applies to the company’s in-house family of text-analyzing models, Titan, as well as Amazon’s code-generating service, CodeWhisperer.
The CodeWhisperer indemnity is broader and applies to all IP claims, including trademarks. However, it requires at least a CodeWhisperer Professional subscription with copyright-defending filtering features enabled. Free users of CodeWhisper aren’t afforded the same protections. And customers must agree to let AWS control their defense and settle “as AWS deems appropriate.”
IBM also provides IP indemnity for its generative AI models, Slate and Granite, available through its Watsonx generative AI service.
“Consistent with IBM’s approach to its indemnification obligation, IBM doesn’t cap its indemnification liability for IBM-developed models,” an IBM spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. “This applies to current [and] future IBM-developed Watsonx models.”
Google wouldn’t respond to my emails. But from the company’s terms, it’d appear that Google offers some defense for customers against third-party allegations of IP infringement arising from its text- and image-generating models. However, Google says that it might suspend a customer’s use of the allegedly infringing model if it can’t find “commercially reasonable” remedies.
Google-backed Cohere, too, has a provision in its terms suggesting that it’ll “defend, indemnify and hold harmless” customers facing third-party claims alleging that Cohere’s models infringe on IP. Given Cohere’s heavy enterprise focus, that’s not surprising.
Microsoft recently made a splashy announcement that it’ll pay legal damages on behalf of customers using its AI products if they’re sued for copyright infringement — so long as those customers use “guardrails and content filters” built into its products.
Which products does it pertain to? That’s where it gets tricky.
Microsoft says its indemnity policy covers paid versions of its portfolio of AI-powered “Copilot” services (including the Microsoft 365 Copilot for Word, Excel and PowerPoint) and Bing Chat Enterprise, the enterprise version of its chatbot on Bing. It also extends to GitHub Copilot, Microsoft’s code-generating service co-developed with OpenAI.
But in its Azure policy, Microsoft clarifies that customers using “previews” of generative AI features powered by its Azure OpenAI Service are responsible for responding to third-party claims of copyright infringement.
Kate Downing, an IP lawyer based in Santa Cruz, takes issue specifically with the Copilot indemnity provision, arguing that — given the vagueness of the provision and its exclusions — the upfront costs of enforcing might be too high for a business to swallow.
By contrast, Adobe claims to offer “full indemnity” protection for users of Firefly, its generative AI art platform, asserting its models are trained on stock images for which Adobe already holds the rights. Users must be enterprise customers, however, and are subject to Adobe’s same liability cap that applies to other tech-based IP claims.
Adobe sometime rival Shutterstock also provides indemnity to all enterprise clients, a policy the company introduced late this summer. So does Getty Images. (Getty Images and Shutterstock, like Adobe, train their models on licensed images.)
The road ahead
It seems likely that, as generative AI vendors, particularly startups, face investor pressure to acquire enterprise customers, indemnification protections will become commonplace. Those customers want the assurance that they won’t be sued over copyright claims, after all.
But if the current state of things is any indication, the policies won’t look similar. And some will have exceptions that’ll make them more attractive in theory than in practice — in other words, more marketing ploy than a legitimate protection.
As a recent article from U.K. law firm Ferrer & Co puts it, indemnities don’t offer a “get out of jail free card” — nor are the a panacea.
“Our key message is, don’t see the offering of provider indemnities as a complete answer to the risk of third-party infringement claims,” the firm writes on its blog. “Instead, weigh the offering of such indemnities in the balance when determining whether to use that provider’s generative AI tool for a project.”

https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/06/spotify-spotted-prepping-a-19-99-mo-superpremium-service-with-lossless-audio-ai-playlists-and-more/,"Spotify spotted prepping a $19.99/mo 'Superpremium' service with lossless audio, AI playlists and more","It looks like Spotify’s rumored “Superpremium” offering is gearing up for a launch. According to references discovered in the Spotify app’s code by Chris Messina, the Superpremium service now has a flashy logo and a longer list of features beyond the 24-bit lossless audio we’ve been anticipating. In fact, the broader feature set appears to be set to include the recently discovered AI playlist generation tools, advanced mixing tools, additional hours of audiobook listening, and a personalized offering called “Your Sound Capsule.”
Messina had also uncovered Spotify’s development of AI playlists earlier this week, which would allow users to create unique playlists using prompts. Spotify declined to confirm the development at the time, noting it wouldn’t comment on possible new features.
However, the references to the Superpremium brand have been found in the code before today.
A couple of weeks ago, Reddit user Hypixely noted that the new, more expensive tier would be priced at $19.99 per month, citing screenshots of Spotify’s code, and would include AI playlists and lossless audio. The latter is no longer referenced as “HiFi,” the premium service Spotify introduced years ago but then failed to launch.
Questioned on the delay in Spotify’s Q2 earnings, CEO Daniel Ek said, “What I will say of course, is that Hi-Fi remains something that we think has value, but it’s something that has value to probably and more aficionados in the streaming market and we’re interested in, obviously, how we could use that as one tool to, in the future, increase our value even further, but we don’t have anything to announce at this point.” Reading between the lines, it sounds like he could be suggesting using HiFi as one way to raise prices in the future, but that the service had been retooled to reach a broader audience.
In addition to the lossless audio and other findings, the Redditor had noted Superpremium users would be able to filter their library by mood, activity, or genre, which Messina also confirms, adding that options like vibe and beats per minute were other filtering options now appearing. Plus, Superpremium includes 20-30 hours of audiobook listening, Messina says — a bit higher than the recently announced 15 free hours that now ship with the Premium subscription.
Meanwhile, the Reddit user had also uncovered a Superpremium feature called Soundcheck that tells you about your listening habits and lets you discover what mix of sounds is “uniquely yours.” However, Messina is seeing this feature now labeled as “Your Sound Capsule.” He suspects could be related to Spotify’s “playlist in a bottle” — a musical time capsule experience launched earlier this year. Plus, Messina found references to something called Highlights, which appears to be Last.fm-like listening stats.
Reached for comment, Spotify declined to share anything more on the new findings.
“At Spotify, we are constantly iterating and ideating to improve our product offering and offer value to users. But we don’t comment on speculation around possible new features and do not have anything new to share at this time,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/06/how-founders-should-approach-tam-when-venture-capital-is-scarce/,How founders should approach TAM when venture capital is scarce,"How founders should approach TAM when venture capital is scarce For entrepreneurs eager to build and scale, VC is *always* scarce
Autumn on planet Earth didn’t start until the equinox a few weeks ago, but the axis shifted months ago in Startupworld, where VC winter has desperate founders smashing up the furniture for firewood.
Metaphorically speaking, of course.
We’re definitely in a down market, but for entrepreneurs who are eager to build and scale, venture capital is always scarce.
At TechCrunch Disrupt, I spoke with three investors to hear how they’re advising founders (especially first-timers) on how to calculate total addressable market, how it differs by sector, and how the TAM slide often reveals whether a founder is even ready to start raising capital:
Jomayra Herrera, partner, Reach Capital
Helen Min, co-founder and managing partner, Phenomenal Ventures
Monique Woodard, founder and managing director, Cake Ventures
This was a jargon-heavy conversation, so before we get into the recap, let’s define terms:
TAM: Total addressable market
SAM: Serviceable addressable market
SOM: Serviceable obtainable market
If we use the example of a startup that makes and sells plant-based dog treats:
TAM: everyone who visits a store that sells dog food
SAM: people who specifically want healthy dog snacks
SOM: how much you think you can sell (go-to-market strategy)
Investors use TAM to get an idea of your company’s upside potential, while SAM and SOM help them offset their risk, regardless of macroeconomic conditions.
Does calculating TAM change during a downturn? Nope
“As an investor, the TAM calculation doesn’t really change whether we are in a more flush environment or a less flush environment,” said Woodard. “You’re still going to be looking for companies that are addressing large markets and trying to figure out the biggest TAM they can get to.”
“The truth is, there is no right or wrong, like, ‘here’s the exact number!’ It’s more about whether we have overlap and agreement in the assumptions around your driver.” Jomayra Herrera, partner, Reach Capital
Hererra agreed: “What hasn’t changed even with a down market is the size of our funds and the exits that we need to realize in order to return those funds,” she said. As a result, “the calculation essentially stays the same.”
Founders should strive to offer more than just eye-popping TAM numbers, said Min. “I think most investors would also say they want to see a small initial market, a market that is just your customer base that’s just obsessed with your product.”
To avoid spinning out in a hype cycle, she encouraged teams to concentrate on building “something that stays evergreen, regardless of what the market looks like.”
Before setting up a meeting, Min said founders should ensure that the TAM they’re pitching aligns with the size of an investors’ fund: “Having a 10x or 100x return on their investment in you, if that doesn’t return their fund, it probably doesn’t make sense for them to invest.”","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/53217986950_59b66a5134_k.jpg?resize=1200,800",2023-10-06 15:00:09
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/06/sample-series-a-pitch-deck-lupiya/,Sample Series A pitch deck: Lupiya's $8.3M deck,"There haven’t been many neobanks cropping up lately, so I was a little surprised to learn that Lupiya recently raised a $8.3 million Series A. The company claims it is trying to make the world better “by creating a landscape that promotes an economically empowered Zambia.”
For the 69th installment (nice!) of the Pitch Deck Teardown series, let’s take a peek at how Lupiya told its story to close this round.
We’re looking for more unique pitch decks to tear down, so if you want to submit your own, here’s how you can do that.
Slides in this deck
Lupiya’s deck is impressively compact at just 10 slides. A compact deck makes for a great way to tell the story quickly, but it also means you risk missing a couple of things.
The company said it has edited its traction slide to protect some sensitive details, but it did share some of the numbers with me in confidence. Suffice it to say the company has some pretty impressive metrics to back up its progress since it was founded in 2016.
Here are the slides in the deck:
Cover slide Problem slide Solution slide Market size slide Business model slide Competition slide Traction slide Team slide Ask and use of funds slide Closing slide
Three things to love
There are always going to be some pieces missing in a 10-slide deck, but overall, I’m extremely impressed by what’s there. Here are three highlights:
A clear, metrics-forward problem statement
A lot of startups give in to the temptation to only state the problem (“Financial services in Africa are inefficient”) and forget to bring the receipts.
Well, take a leaf out of Lupiya’s book: Bring the numbers to show the scope and severity of the problem. It’s almost like a sneaky preview of the market size rolled in with the problem statement. Very well done.
Clear and clean business model
I don’t know about you, but I found it pretty interesting to see the numbers Lupiya has baked into its business model, especially when compared to the numbers I’m used to from banking services elsewhere in the world:
As an investor who’s not from the region, I’d be curious to know what the average deal offering is across the area. Is a 10% service fee and 8% interest common? Is that market rate or a competitive edge?
In any case, I like a good, clean, simple business model, and this ticks that box.
Solution brevity
I often argue that startups spend way too much time on their product slides , so I was impressed with Lupiya’s execution on this front. It shies away from the desire to include pages upon pages of details about its product, instead summarizing the whole thing with three screenshots and three bullet points. In the vast majority of cases, that’s enough for the first pitch; you can always demo the product in a later meeting. Very well done.
In the rest of this teardown, we’ll take a look at three things Lupiya could have improved or done differently, along with its full pitch deck.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/PDT-Lupiya-coer.jpg?resize=1200,675",2023-10-06 14:35:52
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/06/lyca-mobile-says-customer-data-was-stolen-during-cyberattack/,Lyca Mobile says customer data was stolen during cyberattack,"U.K.-based Lyca Mobile has confirmed intruders accessed customers’ personal information after breaking into its systems.
Lyca Mobile, the London-headquartered mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) that piggybacks off network operator EE’s infrastructure, said earlier this week that it had been the target of a cyberattack which caused widespread disruption for millions of its customers, except those based in the United States, Australia, Ukraine and Tunisia.
In an update published on Friday, Lyca Mobile said that it first detected the incident on September 30 and took “immediate action to contain the incident,” such as isolating and shutting down compromised systems. Despite this, the company said that attackers have accessed “at least some of the personal information held in our system.”
While Lyca Mobile didn’t say what kinds of data was stolen, the company said that it holds customer information including names, dates of birth, addresses, copies of identity documents — such as copies of passports or identity cards — as well as customer service interactions, and some payment card information, including the last four digits of customers’ credit card numbers.
Lyca also suggested that customer passwords may have been compromised during the incident. Lyca said it encrypts data in-transit and at-rest, including passwords. When asked by TechCrunch, the company declined to comment on what type of encryption it uses. It’s not yet known if the intruders accessed or stole the company’s encryption keys.
Lyca Mobile has not said how many customers are affected by the incident. The company, which claims to be the world’s largest MVNO, says it has more than 16 million customers globally. Lyca has also yet to confirm how it was compromised or the nature of the security incident, though the company’s confirmation of data theft suggests the incident could be linked to ransomware.
Lyca Mobile spokesperson Cara Whitehouse declined to comment when reached by TechCrunch on Friday as the company is “still working with forensic investigators to assess the full impact on our systems.”
While much of the disruption caused by the cyberattack has been resolved, such as making national and international calls, Lyca Mobile said on Friday that it is currently unable to provide users with port authorization codes, which allow customers to transfer their phone numbers between cell networks. Lyca told TechCrunch earlier this week that customers in some markets remain unable to top-up their balances online.
Lyca Mobile previously told TechCrunch that it notified the U.K.’s Information Commissioner’s Office of the incident, as companies are required by law following a data breach. When reached by TechCrunch, the U.K. data watchdog has not yet commented.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cyber-security-data-phone.jpg?resize=1200,675",2023-10-06 14:25:11

https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/06/x-to-test-three-tiers-of-its-premium-service-ceo-says-code-shows-one-tier-may-be-ad-free/,"X to test three tiers of its Premium service, CEO says; code shows one tier may be ad-free","X, the company formerly known as Twitter, is planning to test three tiers of its X Premium service in order to bring in additional revenue, according to Bloomberg, reporting on X CEO Linda Yaccarino’s briefing to X debt holders on Thursday. The exec told the bankers that X would split the current $7.99 Premium subscription into three different plans: Basic, Standard, and Plus, at various price points. The change would potentially allow X to grow revenues despite the loss in advertising dollars that the company has faced since Elon Musk’s takeover of the platform last fall.
It’s not clear when the three-tier subscription plan would go live, but references found in the X app’s code by @aaronp613 already reference a “Premium Basic,” “Premium Standard” and “Premium Plus” plan, which have full ads, half the ads, or no ads, respectively. This implies that X’s current Premium plan would essentially become the new middle tier as it currently offers subscribers the ability to remove half the ad load. Also unclear if all payers would receive the blue Verification mark, or if that would remain more exclusive.
X Premium will be broken up into 3 tiers: Premium Basic – Full Ads
Premium Standard – Half Ads
Premium Plus – No Ads pic.twitter.com/I0CyaQf2ME — Aaron (@aaronp613) October 5, 2023
The FT had previously reported Yaccarino was planning to meet with the seven banks that had helped to finance Elon Musk’s takeover of the social network — an acquisition that’s now under SEC investigation, as Musk allegedly violated securities laws by scooping up Twitter shares ahead of the acquisition.
In the time since his takeover, his controversial changes have spooked advertisers, as major brands pulled their ads after seeing their posts appear beside hate speech and pro-Nazi content. Reuters this week reported that X’s U.S. ad revenue has declined every month since Musk’s acquisition, with the latest figures showing a 60% year-over-year decline as of August.
In June, Yaccarino joined X (then Twiter) from NBCUniversal where she served as chairman of its advertising and partnerships group, with the goal of getting X’s ads business back on track. Those efforts are still underway, as Bloomberg’s report notes she also told the bankers that advertisers were returning to X, but with smaller budgets than before. She additionally noted the company would be cash-flow positive if not for the debt owed — a figure that’s now $13 billion. Bloomberg estimated that X also owes around $1.2 billion in interest payments on that debt per year.
It’s not clear if the three-tier approach to subscriptions Yaccarino spoke of would include the plan Musk recently introduced when he said that X would be moving to a model where everyone would need to pay a small fee for use of the platform. The X owner explained that charging everyone on the service was the only way to combat the “vast army of bots” X faces. In fact, Yaccarino seemed caught off guard by a question about that plan at the Code Conference last week, when asked how many users X might lose with such a change. Confused, the CEO asked the interviewer to repeat the question and then responded by asking if Musk had actually said that X was doing that, or was he “just thinking about it?”
The odd answer raised questions about how much Yaccarino was in charge of X’s business goals and objectives, while others showcased she didn’t have a solid grip on X’s numbers. For example, at one point during the interview, she said X had “200 to 250 [million]” daily active users, “something like that.” (X clarified to The Information after the fact that X had 245 million.) The two execs often seemed to not be in alignment on their figures, as Musk spoke of X’s 100-200 million posts per day just weeks ago, with Yaccarino this week saying the figure was 500 million. As it turns out, Yaccarino was referring to a combination of original posts, replies, quote posts, and reposts while Musk was only referencing original posts.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/twitter-x-logo-musk-2.jpg?resize=1200,675",2023-10-06 14:03:32
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/06/watch-united-launch-alliance-launch-two-amazon-project-kuiper-test-satellites/,Watch United Launch Alliance launch two Project Kuiper test satellites for Amazon,"After years of development, the moment is finally here: Amazon will send two of its Kuiper test satellites to space, as the company looks to take on reigning incumbent SpaceX with its own satellite internet constellation.
The two prototypes will launch aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral in Florida during a two-hour launch window that opens at 2 PM EST. In a recent blog post, Amazon said the two satellites – dubbed KuiperSat-1 and KuiperSat-2 – are “the first iterations of more than 3,200 satellites Project Kuiper plans to manufacture and deploy over the next six years.”
Although the company will have a long way to go before filling the skies with its mega-constellation, the launch represents a key milestone and will no doubt give Amazon’s technical Kuiper team tons of data on satellite performance.
“We’ve done extensive testing here in our lab and have a high degree of confidence in our satellite design, but there’s no substitute for on-orbit testing,” said Rajeev Badyal, Project Kuiper’s vice president of technology. “This is Amazon’s first time putting satellites into space, and we’re going to learn an incredible amount regardless of how the mission unfolds.”
Like SpaceX’s Starlink, customers will be able to use Kuiper internet by purchasing individual terminals. This prototype mission will test how the satellites interact with those terminals, as well as the ground systems that the satellites will use to communicate with Earth.
Amazon is aiming to launch its first production satellites in the first half of next year and start beta testing with customers by the end of 2024. The company has a bit of pressure to move fast: it has to have at least half of its planned constellation in orbit by 2026 to be in compliance with its spectrum license from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission.
Back in 2020, Amazon said it would invest more than $10 billion in Kuiper across the ground network, satellite testing and manufacturing, and user terminals.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-Protoflight-mission-payload-arrives-at-the-VIF.-Photo-by-United-Launch-Alliance.jpg?resize=1200,843",2023-10-06 13:00:25
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/06/mgm-resorts-admits-hackers-stole-customers-personal-data-cyberattack/,MGM Resorts confirms hackers stole customers' personal data during cyberattack,"MGM Resorts has confirmed hackers stole an unspecified amount of customers’ personal information during a September cyberattack that will cost the hotel and casino giant an estimated $100 million.
The hotel and casino giant first disclosed it had been targeted by a large-scale cyberattack on September 11. The cyberattack, which was days later claimed by hackers from ALPHV subgroup Scattered Spider, caused widespread disruption across MGM’s properties, shutting down ATMs and slot machines and pulling the company’s website and online booking systems offline.
In a regulatory filing onThursday, the company admitted that the hackers responsible for the attack obtained some personal information belonging to customers who transacted with MGM Resorts prior to March 2019. This includes names, contact information, gender, dates of birth, and driver’s license number. For a limited number of customers, hackers also accessed Social Security numbers and passport details, the company said.
It’s not yet known how many individuals have been affected by the data breach, but MGM’s resorts attract tens of millions of visitors each year. MGM spokespeople Andrew Chapman and Brian Ahern have repeatedly declined to answer TechCrunch’s questions about the incident.
In its filing, MGM added that it does not believe that customer passwords or payment details were obtained during the attack.
MGM’s filing with regulators reveals that the company expects the attack to reduce its third-quarter profit by approximately $100 million. MGM said it has also spent around $10 million in one-time expenses related to the cyberattack, mostly on technology consulting services, legal fees, and expenses of other third-party advisors.
According to the Wall Street Journal, MGM Resorts reportedly did not pay the attackers’ ransom demand, the amount of which is not yet known. When asked by TechCrunch, a representative for the Scattered Spider group did not comment. MGM’s rival Caesars Entertainment, which was also hit by a recent ransomware attack, is said to have paid about half of the $30 million demanded by the hackers to prevent the disclosure of stolen data. Media reports said the Scattered Spider group was also responsible for the Caesars cyberattack, but the group told TechCrunch at the time it had “no involvement” with the incident.
MGM said it expects that its cyber insurance policy will be “sufficient” to cover the financial impact to its business, but noted that the “the full scope of the costs and related impacts of this issue has not been determined.”
The company added that it has seen “no evidence” that the data obtained by the criminal actors has been used for identity theft or account fraud.
The listing for MGM Resorts found on the dark web leak site of the ALPHV ransomware gang has not been updated since September 14, and it doesn’t appear that the hackers have yet published any of the data stolen from the hotel giant.
While MGM claims that the cyberattack has been “fully contained” and that operations at the company’s resorts have “returned to normal,” some of the MGM’s services are still not operational at the time of writing, according to customer complaints on social media, including MGM’s mobile app.
“The company continues to focus on restoring the remaining impacted guest-facing systems and the Company anticipates that these systems will be restored in the coming days,” MGM said.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Arcimoto-Las-Vegas-1.jpeg?resize=1200,790",2023-10-06 12:05:23
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/06/snap-ico-notice/,Snap's AI chatbot draws scrutiny in UK over kids' privacy concerns,"Snap’s AI chatbot has landed the company on the radar of the UK’s data protection watchdog which has raised concerns the tool may be a risk to children’s privacy.
The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) announced today that it’s issued a preliminary enforcement notice on Snap over what it described as “potential failure to properly assess the privacy risks posed by its generative AI chatbot ‘My AI’”.
The ICO action is not a breach finding. But the notice indicates the UK regulator has concerns that Snap may not have taken steps to ensure the product complies with data protection rules, which — since 2021 — have been dialled up to include the Children’s Design Code.
“The ICO’s investigation provisionally found the risk assessment Snap conducted before it launched ‘My AI’ did not adequately assess the data protection risks posed by the generative AI technology, particularly to children,” the regulator wrote in a press release. “The assessment of data protection risk is particularly important in this context which involves the use of innovative technology and the processing of personal data of 13 to 17 year old children.”
Snap will now have a chance to respond to the regulator’s concerns before the ICO takes a final decision on whether the company has broken the rules.
“The provisional findings of our investigation suggest a worrying failure by Snap to adequately identify and assess the privacy risks to children and other users before launching ‘My AI’,” added information commissioner, John Edwards, in a statement. “We have been clear that organisations must consider the risks associated with AI, alongside the benefits. Today’s preliminary enforcement notice shows we will take action in order to protect UK consumers’ privacy rights.”
Snap launched the generative AI chatbot back in February — though it didn’t arrive in the UK until April — leveraging OpenAI’s ChatGPT large language model (LLM) technology to power a bot that was pinned to the top of users’ feed to act as a virtual friend that could be asked advice or sent snaps.
Initially the feature was only available to subscribers of Snapchat+, a premium version of the ephemeral messaging platform. But pretty quickly Snap opened access of “My AI” to free users too — also adding the ability for the AI to send snaps back to users who interacted with it (these snaps are created with generative AI).
The company has said the chatbot has been developed with additional moderation and safeguarding features, including age consideration as a default — with the aim of ensuring generated content is appropriate for the user. The bot is also programmed to avoid responses that are violent, hateful, sexually explicit, or otherwise offensive. Additionally, Snap’s parental safeguarding tools let parents know whether their kid has been communicating with the bot in the past seven days — via its Family Center feature.
But despite the claimed guardrails there have been reports of the bot going off the rails. In an early assessment back in March, The Washington Post reported the chatbot had recommended ways to mask the smell of alcohol after it was told that the user was 15. In another case when it was told the user was 13 and asked how they should prepare to have sex for the first time, the bot responded with suggestions for “making it special” by setting the mood with candles and music.
Snapchat users have also been reported bullying the bot — with some also frustrated an AI has been injected into their feeds in the first place.
Reached for comment on the ICO notice, a Snap spokesperson told TechCrunch:
We are closely reviewing the ICO’s provisional decision. Like the ICO we are committed to protecting the privacy of our users. In line with our standard approach to product development, My AI went through a robust legal and privacy review process before being made publicly available. We will continue to work constructively with the ICO to ensure they’re comfortable with our risk assessment procedures.
It’s not the first time an AI chatbot has landed on the radar of European privacy regulators. In February Italy’s Garante ordered the San Francisco-based maker of “virtual friendship service” Replika with an order to stop processing local users’ data — also citing concerns about risks to minors.
The Italian authority also put a similar stop-processing-order on OpenAI’s ChatGPT tool the following month. The block was then lifted in April but only after OpenAI had added more detailed privacy disclosures and some new user controls — including letting users ask for their data not to be used to train its AIs and/or to be deleted.
The regional launch of Google’s Bard chatbot was also delayed after concerns were raised by its lead regional privacy regulator, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission. It subsequently launched in the EU in July, also after adding more disclosures and controls — but a regulatory taskforce set up within the European Data Protection Board remains focused on assessing how to enforce the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on generative AI chatbots, including ChatGPT and Bard.
Poland’s data protection authority also confirmed last month that it’s investigating a complaint against ChatGPT.
Discussing how privacy and data protection regulators are approaching generative AI, Dr Gabriela Zanfir-Fortuna, VP for global privacy at the Washington-based thinktank, the Future of Privacy Forum (FPF), pointed to a statement adopted by G7 DPAs this summer — which includes watchdogs in France, Germany, Italy and the UK — in which they listed key areas of concern, such as these tools’ legal basis for processing personal data, including minors’ data.
“Developers and providers should embed privacy in the design, conception, operation, and management of new products and services that use generative AI technologies, based on the concept of ‘Privacy by Design’ and document their choices and analyses in a privacy impact assessment,” the G7 DPAs also affirmed.
Earlier this year the UK’s ICO also put out guidelines for developers seeking to apply generative AI — listing eight questions it suggested they should be asking when building products such as AI chatbots.
Speaking at the G7 symposium in July, Edwards reiterated the need for developers to pay attention. In remarks picked up by the FPF he said commissioners are “keen to ensure” they “do not miss this essential moment in the development of this new technology in a way that [they] missed the moment of building the business models underpinning social media and online advertising” — with the UK’s information commissioner also warning: “We are here and watching.”
So while Zanfir-Fortuna suggests it’s not too unusual to see the UK authority issuing a public preliminary enforcement notice, as it is here on Snap, she agreed regulators are being perhaps more public than usual about their actions vis-a-vis generative AI — turning their attentiveness into a public warning, even as they consider how best to enforce existing privacy rules on LLMs.
“All regulators have been acting quite cautiously, but always public, and they seem to want to persuade companies to be more cautious and to bring data protection on the top of their priorities when building these tools and making them available to the public,” she told TechCrunch. “A common thread in existing regulatory action is that we are seeing preliminary decisions, deadlines given to companies to bring their processing in compliance, letters of warning, press releases that investigations are open, rather than actual enforcement decisions.”

https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/06/breathe-battery-technologies-series-a/,Breathe Battery Technologies bets that software will eat batteries too,"Lithium-ion batteries have been making steady progress over the past decade, boosting energy density while also falling in price. But Ian Campbell thinks that today’s designs, no matter how advanced, are still leaving something on the table.
“There’s a gobsmackingly enormous amount of performance still to be unlocked from existing materials and chemistries,” he told TechCrunch+.
Campbell has spent much of the last decade studying how batteries charge and why they fail, two characteristics of every battery that are tightly bound. In the process, he and his colleagues at Breathe Battery Technologies have developed a bit of software that can be slipped into just about any lithium-ion battery in use today, endowing it with either faster charging speeds or greater longevity.
The startup offers two different products, Charge and Life. The former reduces charging times by a significant measure. The company’s code shaved 27% off the 0% to 80% charging time for a standard battery type used in warehouse robots, for example. The latter improves the longevity of the battery. In the case of the Oppo Reno8 Series phones, the company says its software significantly reduces battery degradation, hitting 80% capacity after four years instead of two.
“Customers get a better, longer-lasting laptop or car. If you’re the OEM that sells it to us, you have a more sustainable product, you have better warrantability, you have less balance sheet risk,” said Campbell, who is co-founder and CEO at Breathe.
The real prize is the automotive sector. Already, 60% of the lithium-ion batteries produced in the world are destined for electric vehicles, according to Allied Market Research. In the coming years, that share is likely to grow further even as the sector continues to expand rapidly.
Breathe said that it’s currently working with Rimac and Cosworth, and Campbell said that conversations with other car companies were “very far along.” “We’re making a lot of headway in automotive, and I’m very excited.”
Breathe recently closed a competitive $10 million Series A led by Lowercarbon Capital with participation from Speedinvest, TechCrunch+ has exclusively learned.
The startup’s software can run on industry standard microcontrollers that oversee the charging and discharging of a battery in an EV or an electronic device.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/breathe-charge-demo.jpg?resize=1200,800",2023-10-06 11:00:40
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/06/ohms-quest-is-an-electronic-puzzle-console-inspired-by-escape-rooms/,Ohm’s Quest is an electronic puzzle console inspired by escape rooms,"Ohm’s Quest is a steampunk-inspired cubical device that acts as a sort of escape game console. You can scan an NFC-enabled card on a side of the cube, and it starts a new story with interactive challenges that you should solve as a team.
While we don’t cover board games very often on TechCrunch, there was something fun about Ohm’s Quest when I talked with the team behind it. This project sits at the intersection of escape rooms, board games and tech creativity.
The team already launched pre-orders on Kickstarter and Indiegogo. It raised €230,000 from more than a thousand backers and it expects to ship the game in early 2024. The starter kit currently costs $249.
“We design audio stories in which you are the hero. You play together with a team against the story. As a result, there are characters in the story who need your help to solve problems,” co-founder and CTO Allison Klopp told me.
And the interface with the game is these cubes pictured above. You get two cubes in the box and you can connect them with a cable — they communicate wirelessly but there are multiple slots that will be used differently depending on the story. On one side of the cube, there is a control panel with LED-enabled buttons and a directional joystick and a dial.
There’s a speaker to hear the story as well as a built-in accelerometer. On another side, there’s a tiny display that can be used to display messages or the time remaining before something dramatic happens.
“As these interfaces come without any context, we add context with cardboard elements, such as cards, instruction manuals, game boards,” co-founder and CEO Etienne Pouget told me. Some cards have an NFC tag, which means that the cube can also receive some information from specific cards.
Some challenges involve sound mixing, solving a labyrinth, asking questions to potential murderers using cards, passing a chemical element from one cube to another, etc.
It’s a hardware/software play and Ohm’s Quest expects to ship a new story every month when the cubes are available. The team is also working on a mobile app so that you can buy new stories and transfer them to the cube.
Some stories will be purely digital — you’ll be able buy them at home and print the instructions to play them. Other stories will come with new accessories — game board, figurines and cards.
Ohm’s Quest also hopes that it can create a community of players around its game. There will be a creator mode so that the most enthusiastic players can design their own stories. The Ohm’s Quest team could then work with an illustrator to create cards for those stories — story creators would be compensated.
As you can see, the team behind Ohm’s Quest has plenty of creative ideas for its puzzle-meet-story platform. There could be new cubes in the future as well with new interaction methods. “The one we’re dreaming of is a cube with an olfactory interface to create investigations using scents,” Pouget said.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ohms-Quest-1.jpg?w=1080,2023-10-06 08:10:00

Premji Invest and stock broking giant Zerodha are among the prospective backers that have held conversations with Bank of Baroda, which has agreed to sell a significant stake in the subsidiary, the people said, requesting anonymity as the deliberations are private.
Private equity firm Multiples has also engaged with the lender, one person said.
Bank of Baroda, which owns over 98% stake in Nainital Bank, has been looking to divest its stake in Nainital Bank, which operates in five Indian states and has over 140 branches, for over a year at the direction of the regulator. The talks have reached serious deliberations in recent weeks.
Bank of Baroda, the second largest PSU bank in India, plans to initially divest about 40 to 50% stake in Nainital Bank and eventually sell the remaining shares, another person familiar with the matter said. A consortium of multiple entities is likely to win the bid, one of the people said.
A deal hadn’t been reached at the time of publishing, and existing prospective investors may still not end up forging the investment, people familiar with the situation cautioned.
Bank of Baroda, Multiples, and Premji Invest didn’t respond to a request for comment. Zerodha declined to comment.
The investment talks come as the Reserve Bank of India evaluates permitting external investors back a handful of lenders. Accel and Quona last year backed Shivalik Bank and fintech unicorn Slice said this week that it had received the approval from the central bank to merge with North East Small Finance Bank.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/05/netflix-india-subscribers/,"Netflix's 6.5M India subscribers dwarfed by Prime Video and Disney, Bernstein says","Netflix has “not succeeded” in scaling up its business in India despite the global streaming giant consistently lowering the subscription costs in the country, analysts at AllianceBernstein wrote in a report to clients Thursday.
The U.S. streamer has about 6.5 million subscribers in India, compared to Prime Video’s 20 million in the South Asian market, the analysts wrote. Disney+ Hotstar continues to dominate the market with over 40 million subscribers.
AllianceBernstein attributed Netflix slower growth in India to lack of local content, saying only 12% of the titles the global streamer offers in the country were local content. About 60% of Prime Video’s catalog in India, in comparison, was in domestic languages.
The poor reception in India comes despite Netflix consistently lowering the prices in the country even as it has virtually raised the prices in all other key markets. Netflix inked a “first-of-its-kind” deal with Jio Platforms, India’s largest telecom operator, to bundle the streaming service with the carrier’s pay-as-you-go plans in August.
“Perhaps the lesson from India points to both the need for higher density of local-language content as we described above, but also a recognition that in many emerging markets, value is less tied to a comparison with other streaming services and more tied to a much lower cost of linear TV or Internet video. India, for example, is likely YouTube’s largest market, and a key growth area for social media names,” the analysts wrote.
Netflix didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Disney’s Hotstar continues to dominate its competitors in India, thanks to its cricket streaming offerings, which consistently attract millions of live viewers during matches. The platform is even offering free streaming of the ongoing ICC Cricket World Cup, an event that will last over 45 days, to all mobile users. JioCinema, the latest venture by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, is taking a page from Disney’s strategy — of acquiring rights to high-profile cricket matches — and is increasingly emerging as a formidable contender.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1247248367.jpg?resize=1200,800",2023-10-06 05:33:31
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/05/paradigm-matt-huang-testimony-sbf-trial-investor-fraud/,'Marked to zero': Paradigm testimony at SBF trial points to investor fraud,"The testimony of Matt Huang, co-founder and managing partner of crypto investment firm Paradigm, at Sam Bankman-Fried’s trial may help the prosecution convince jurors that the former crypto mogul defrauded investors.
Huang testified Thursday that he and his firm were in the dark about a range of business practices at FTX, red flags that would have affected his decision to invest in the company. Namely, FTX’s use of customer funds to prop up Bankman-Fried‘s hedge fund Alameda Research.
Government cooperation aside, Huang likely has his own motives for testifying against Bankman-Fried and distancing his firm from FTX. Paradigm is part of a class-action lawsuit (which was temporarily stayed in June) that accuses it, alongside Sequoia Capital and Thoma Bravo, of promoting FTX to the detriment of its users.
According to Huang’s testimony, Paradigm was duped, as well.
Over two funding rounds between 2021 and 2022, Paradigm invested $278 million into FTX. When prosecutor Thane Rehn asked what Paradigm estimates the current value of that investment to be, Huang replied, “We have marked it to zero.”
That establishes damage has been done in the form of financial losses, one of the things the prosecution will have to establish in order to prove fraud.
The government will also have to establish misrepresentation, showing that the defendant made false statements or concealed material information in order to convince investors to fork over money. Prosecutors also need to prove that the investors relied on Bankman-Fried’s misrepresentations. Finally, they’ll need to demonstrate that Bankman-Fried intended to defraud investors, which could be more difficult.
Huang’s testimony Thursday at least supports the establishment of three out of four of those elements.
Paradigm began considering investment into FTX in 2019, according to Huang. During that time, Huang testified that he was told FTX exchange wallets served as a custodian for customer deposits and would always be available if customers wished to withdraw. He wasn’t told that FTX could take those deposits out and use them for their own business purposes.
When asked if he would have still invested in FTX knowing that, Huang responded, “Likely not.”
“If it became known that they were doing that, I think the exchange would lose credibility in the brand and people wouldn’t want to use it, so it would be existential to the business,” said Huang.
Not only was Huang uninformed about FTX’s habit of using customer deposits for its own purposes, but he also testified that he didn’t know Alameda was able to access those deposits, and wouldn’t have invested in FTX if he had.
“Customer deposits are sort of sacred,” he said.
As Paradigm was considering investment into FTX, Huang said he raised concerns about the link between Alameda and FTX. Mainly, he was worried that Alameda — one of the largest traders on the platform — would get preferential treatment, which would also be damaging to FTX’s reputation.
Bankman-Fried told Huang Alameda didn’t have preferential treatment on the platform. But the prosecution pointed out that Alameda was exempt from FTX’s liquidation engine, a risk management strategy that’s designed to automatically trigger the sale of assets if certain risk parameters are exceeded.
Huang said FTX’s liquidation engine was a big part of why Paradigm was attracted to the company. He also agreed that Alameda’s exemption is inconsistent with Bankman-Fried’s statement that it didn’t get preferential treatment.
“It would have meant that Alameda could trade with leverage on the platform and, if those trades didn’t work out, could ultimately incur a negative balance that would have to be paid for somehow,” said Huang. “In a typical case, that might come from the money we were investing into the company that would go to fund operations. But in any case, it would leave the business at risk of becoming insolvent.”
Rehn also sought to establish that Bankman-Fried made false statements to lull Paradigm into investing. He pulled up an excel spreadsheet that had been attached to an email Bankman-Fried sent to Huang showing FTX’s financial stats as of April 2021. The balance sheet showed FTX’s annualized approximate revenue, estimating a net profit for Q1 2021 of $85 million. Rehn asserted that FTX had moved certain expenses off those financial statements in order to artificially inflate the reported net profits.
Throughout his testimony, Huang repeated that he had also expressed concerns with Bankman-Fried over FTX’s lack of a board and lack of governance, which he said could lead to unintended value leakage. While this did not ultimately stop Paradigm from investing in FTX, Huang testified that “SBF was very resistant to having investors on the board.”","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1708738406.jpg?resize=1200,800",2023-10-06 03:35:40
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/05/all-eyes-on-vw-after-hyundai-kia-adopt-tesla-charging-standard/,"All eyes on VW after Hyundai, Kia adopt Tesla charging standard","Hyundai and Kia have finally announced their plans to adopt Tesla’s North American Charging Standard (NACS) ports for their electric vehicles in the U.S. and Canada, joining the swells of automakers that have also promised to do so.
The move will give Hyundai and Kia drivers — as well as drivers of Ford, General Motors, Mercedes-Benz, Honda and Rivian vehicles — access to thousands of Tesla Superchargers across the two countries and Mexico.
As NACS seems to outstrip the Combined Charging System (CCS) as the new charging standard, the question on the auto industry’s mind is when will Volkswagen ante up?
In June, VW’s EV charging subsidiary Electrify America said it would add the NACS connector to Electrify America and Electrify Canada’s fast charging networks by 2025. Many thought that day wouldn’t happen, given how much money VW had to shell out to build that CCS-based charging network in the first place. VW poured $2 billion into building out the Electrify America (EA) as part of a settlement of the VW diesel emissions scandal.
Like most other charging companies, EA said it would continue to provide CCS connectors throughout its network, as well. And Tesla will include CCS connectors at some of its U.S. charging stations to reap some of the rewards of the Biden administration’s IRA subsidies. Tesla’s Supercharger network accounts for about 60% of fast chargers in the U.S., according to the Department of Energy.
Volkswagen didn’t respond in time to TechCrunch’s request for comment, but the company has been in talks with Tesla to adopt the NACS charge port on future vehicles since summer 2023. VW is one of the largest automakers in the world, representing brands like Audi, Bentley, Bugatti, Porsche and Lamborghini.
Over the next few years, under the VW brand, the automaker hopes to release a range of new EV models, including the 2024 ID.3, 2024 ID.7 and the 2025 ID.7 Wagon.
Most of the automakers that have signed up to build EVs equipped with NACS ports are aiming for 2025 models. Hyundai is aiming for even earlier.
The automaker said Thursday that new Hyundai EVs in the U.S. — like the Ioniq 5, Ioniq 6 and upcoming Ioniq 7 — will come with the NACS port starting in the fourth quarter of 2024. That will begin in Canada in the first half of 2025. Genesis, Hyundai’s luxury brand, will also jump on the NACS train.
Kia also said it would build the NACS port into new EVs sold in North America in the fourth quarter of 2024.
Both Hyundai and Kia said they expect to have adapters available at dealers in the first quarter of 2025, for customers who own vehicles with CCS ports.
Tesla’s NACS is quickly becoming the industry standard, in part due to Tesla’s already strong footprint of Superchargers at good locations along highways. EV drivers also say Tesla offers a more streamlined and simpler charging process.
In late June, SAE International, formerly the Society of Automotive Engineers, said it would develop an industry standard around NACS, which would assuage other companies wary of letting a competitor control a key part of the EV experience.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GettyImages-1252172149.jpg?resize=1200,736",2023-10-05 23:17:53
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/05/a16z-backed-castelion-wants-to-mass-produce-defense-hardware-starting-with-hypersonics/,"a16z-backed Castelion wants to mass produce defense hardware, starting with hypersonics","One builds weapons in the hope that they are not used. Thus goes the central premise of deterrence theory, which says it is the credible threat of aggression — not the use of aggression — that will ensure states avoid war.
This theory has dominated much of America’s strategic thinking over the past 50-plus years, but new technologies and new adversaries threaten to upend the status quo. For the first time, China has started to outpace the U.S. in critical weapons programs — the country developed a new type of weapon called a hypersonic glide vehicle as early as 2014, which can strike Taipei and the Taiwan Strait in about 20 minutes from its strategic bases in the South China Sea. America’s comparative sluggishness to develop such tech could result in the U.S. falling catastrophically behind its adversaries.
The founders of Castelion, a startup that emerged from stealth this week, cut straight to the point: “Simply put — this cannot be allowed to happen.”
The 11-month-old startup wants to completely rethink defense hardware development for complex systems, starting with long-range strike hypersonic weapons, a capability that Castelion co-founder and CEO Bryon Hargis described as “a national, strategic-level non-nuclear deterrent.”
“China is going faster than us in basically every area,” he said. “They pass the U.S. in some areas, but if you give them enough time, they’re going to pass us in all areas if we don’t do something different. It’s, in my opinion, existential. We grew up in an era of fairly good security and I don’t know necessarily that our children are to have that opportunity if somebody doesn’t do something about it.”
Making American deterrence credible again
Castelion was founded by a trio of ex-SpaceXers, Bryon Hargis, Sean Pitt and Andrew Kreitz, in November 2022. The company is part of a wave of new defense tech startups that have little faith in large American primes and their ability to ensure the country retains its dominant position in the global asymmetry of military power.
In a blog post announcing Castelion, the founders say as much, writing that conditions in the defense industrial base, like consolidation, production delays and ballooning program costs, “have left our nation in a worse position to protect democracy and confront our adversaries around the world.”
The startup wants to do things differently: move faster, design hardware to be produced at scale, and vertically integrate to cut costs. Pitt said that long-range strike weapons were a clear opportunity for an agile hardware development approach.
Its thesis has caught investor support, with the company closing a $14.2 million initial funding round co-led by Andreessen Horowitz and Lavrock Ventures, with participation from First In, BlueYard Capital and Champion Hill Ventures.
Castelion’s founding team is notable for their individual success in the aerospace industry. Hargis, a mechanical engineer by training, joined SpaceX in 2017 and eventually became a senior director of government sales, essentially building out an entire government sales team and that enormous line of business for the company; Pitt was the original salesperson for SpaceX’s hugely successful ride-share program and eventually became director of launch and human spaceflight sales for the European continent; and Kreitz was a senior investment banker at Goldman Sachs before joining SpaceX as senior finance manager.
Hargis and Pitt worked alongside each other at SpaceX’s D.C. office, and Hargis and Kreitz worked directly together regarding finance matters. The three would talk on the evenings and weekends, Pitt said, and the thesis for the company started forming. It was clear that they would have to leave SpaceX if they wanted to focus on defense hardware: SpaceX is not a defense company, even if its technologies do much to serve the national interest.
“SpaceX is fundamentally a Mars company,” Kreitz said. “It will do great defense work if it’s along that development path, but [it] isn’t core, and that’s what precipitated us leaving.”
Hargis echoed these comments: “I think we did some amazing work at SpaceX for national security that will continue to pay dividends for the country for probably multiple decades to come. But I really wanted to be more focused on defense than SpaceX wanted to be.”
Castelion is kicking off by focusing on hypersonic missile systems. The U.S. wants to procure these capabilities for a handful of reasons, many of which have to do with the particulars of the Western Pacific theater. These systems offer a big boost in range without a commensurate energy cost, which is critical for safely covering the roughly 1,800 miles between the U.S. territory of Guam and the coast of China. Speed is critical, too: As two officials from the U.S. Department of Defense put it in a recent op-ed, all of the missiles in America’s arsenal “appropriate for the Western Pacific theater” will need to fly at Mach speeds.
Hypersonic missiles are also highly maneuverable, which makes it difficult to predict where they will strike. But perhaps most importantly, they offer a non-nuclear deterrence option — a way for both the United States and China to avoid a severely catastrophic outcome that both countries have vowed to avoid via the adoption of no-first use policies.
Of course, Castelion can’t simply turn up on Uncle Sam’s doorstep one day with a fully finished hypersonic weapon and a bill. Instead, the El Segundo, California–based startup is taking time to build its credibility with missile subsystems: solid rocket motors, low-cost avionics and ultra-high temperature ceramic matrix composite (CMC) materials. The idea is to first become a supplier to a prime working on an existing hypersonic missile program, before eventually building complete missile systems all in-house.
Because rapid design-build-test cycles are built into the company’s strategic mission, the company is also focused on building a hypersonic test platform both for customers looking to test and for in-house testing.
Castelion’s primary engineering efforts, which include developing the avionics and manufacturing the high-temperature CMCs, are taking place in El Segundo. Castelion also has a special use permit for outside of Naval Air Station Fallon in Nevada to do rocket motor production and testing. Looking ahead, the company plans on conducting its first full flight test of its solid motors using a single-stage rocket later this year, and the company plans on scaling its materials testing, starting with a subscale hypersonic glide vehicle shell to demonstrate that it can make complex shapes using the CMC material.
Next year, the 15-person company is planning on making a two-stage test vehicle. It also aims to execute its three government contracts (the details of which the company couldn’t disclose) and to continue building out its team. It’s more than a little ambitious.
“We’re fairly used to being called crazy,” Hargis joked. “I could see it from the outside, being slightly skeptical, but I think that after you’ve done several crazy things successfully, you realize it’s not crazy to dream big.”","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image003.jpg?resize=1200,800",2023-10-05 22:30:01
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/05/sbf-trial-gary-wang/,Alameda had a $65B line of credit and 'unlimited withdrawals',"The Sam Bankman-Fried trial gained steam after a somewhat sleepier first half of the day. That’s when prosecutors and the defense asked a witness and former FTX developer about the technical details of the crypto exchange as well as Alameda Research.
But that changed around 4 p.m. when FTX co-founder and CTO Gary Wang took the stand, wearing a wrinkled suit. Prior to Wang taking the stand, there was a 15-minute break during which Bankman-Fried looked visibly irritated.
Bankman-Fried’s parents were also there. During the break, they went to their son seemingly in an effort to provide support. At one point his father, Joseph Bankman, patted his mother, Barbara Fried, on the back, said something and laughed. She didn’t laugh back but continued to look away toward her son.
On the stand, Wang admitted that he committed wire fraud, securities fraud and commodities fraud. He added that Bankman-Fried, Nishad Singh and Caroline Ellison were the individuals he committed the crimes with.
Wang, Singh and Ellison pleaded guilty in late December 2022 as part of a deal to cooperate with the government and testify during this trial.
Wang said that they were given “special privileges from Alameda Research,” the crypto trading firm that he said he and Bankman-Fried started prior to launching FTX. Those privileges included getting large lines of credit, unlimited withdrawals and being able to have negative balances. Wang said that the “unlimited funds” came from FTX customers; a special code was added to customer transactions that funneled the money to Alameda.
He shared during his testimony that he was in charge of writing and reviewing code. And while Bankman-Fried did not write the code, Wang said Bankman-Fried did tell him and other developers what to implement. “Sometimes we talked [disagreements] out, but in the end, it’s Sam’s decision,” Wang said.
Negative balances, unlimited withdrawals
Because of these special privileges, Alameda had a $65 billion line of credit, Wang said. “Normal large businesses have single to double digits [of credit] in the millions.” By the time the two businesses filed for bankruptcy in mid November 2022, Alameda withdrew $8 billion, Wang said.
These internal financial advantages were not disclosed to the public, he shared.
Alameda and FTX were both started by Bankman-Fried and Wang, with ownership split 90% and 10%, and then 17% equity and 65% equity, respectively. Singh also had 5% equity of FTX, and a number of outside investors held other positions, Wang noted.
The ownership percentages never changed, he added. At the time, both Wang and Bankman-Fried were billionaires.
During his time at the companies, Wang also disclosed that Alameda “loaned” him around $200 million to $300 million. But the money never went to his bank account, and it instead went to investments that FTX made into other companies.
Naming the business
The company also picked its name to outsmart other businesses, which might have negative connotations toward companies with crypto jargon in their titles. “Alameda” derived from Alameda County in California and “Research,” was because it “sounds prestigious” and is not using a crypto-related name, Wang said.
The initial funds for Alameda came from Bankman-Fried personally as well as various lenders. Wang said Bankman-Fried also believed it would be easier to get bank accounts, rental leases, investors and so on, with a more “normal” company name.
The prosecutors aired a clip of Bankman-Fried from April 2021 on a podcast, where he explained Alameda’s name. “If we named our company Shitcoin Day Trader’s Inc., no one would do business [with us],” he said at the time.
Wang’s testimony is expected to continue on Friday morning until midday, according to prosecutors at the trial.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ftx-broken-on-fire.jpg?resize=1200,645",2023-10-05 21:35:03
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/05/spyhide-oospy-hacked-phone-spyware-shuts-down/,Hacked phone spyware shuts down… again,"A short-lived spyware operation called Oospy, which emerged earlier this year after its predecessor Spyhide was hacked, is no longer operational and has shut down.
Oospy appeared online in late July as a rebrand of a phone monitoring app called Spyhide, which was facilitating the surveillance of tens of thousands of Android device owners around the world. Spyhide shut down after a breach exposed the operation and its administrators who were profiting from it.
Although Spyhide’s website disappeared from the internet after the hack burned the operation, the spyware’s back-end server stayed online and was still communicating with the tens of thousands of phones it was monitoring since the server was hosted on an entirely different domain. That allowed the administrators to rebrand Spyhide to Oospy without affecting the spyware operation itself.
That back-end server, which stored the victim’s stolen phone data from thousands of Android devices around the world, was taken offline Thursday by the web host Hetzner, which said the service violated its terms of service.
“In addition, we have terminated the customer’s server contract in due time,” Christian Fitz, a spokesperson for Hetzner, told TechCrunch.
In their time online, Spyhide and Oospy had at least 60,000 victims across the world, including thousands of victims in the United States. These stalkerware (also known as spouseware) apps are planted on a victim’s phone, often by someone with knowledge of their passcode. Once planted, these apps continually steal a victim’s contacts, messages, photos, call logs and recordings, and granular location history.
Following the Spyhide hack, TechCrunch identified two of the administrators behind Spyhide and Oospy. One of the administrators, Mohammad (also goes by Mojtaba) Arasteh, confirmed to TechCrunch that he worked on the project “several years ago as a programmer,” but denied involvement with Oospy.
But a mistake on Oospy’s checkout page, which used PayPal to process customer payments, exposed the name of the PayPal account holder, who shares the same family name as Arasteh.
It’s not uncommon for spyware operations to rely on payment services like PayPal to handle customer payments, despite PayPal’s policies broadly prohibiting customers from using its service to buy or sell software that facilitate illegal activity, like spyware. PayPal spokesperson Caitlin Girouard did not comment on the accounts when reached by TechCrunch. Oospy stopped accepting PayPal for payments a short time later, though it’s not known if PayPal took action against the account.
Arasteh did not comment on the PayPal account when contacted by TechCrunch. Soon after contacting Arasteh, Oospy’s website went offline altogether.
The shutdown of the spyware’s back-end server marks the end of Spyhide and Oospy’s ability to operate, for now.

https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/evaluation-of-ank-101-and-keytruda-combination-in-patients-with-advanced-solid-tumours/38010/,Evaluation of ANK-101 and KEYTRUDA® combination in patients with advanced solid tumours,"Ankyra Therapeutics have announced a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with MSD to evaluate the combination of ANK-101 and KEYTRUDA® in patients with advanced solid tumours.
Following the completion of a first-in-human phase I study of ANK-101 in patients with advanced solid tumours, a clinical trial collaboration will now take place to evaluate the efficiency of using both ANK-101 and KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab).
The study is anticipated to begin enrollment in 2024.
‘ANK-101 has demonstrated therapeutic activity’
The Ankyra platform uses an inert scaffolding composed of aluminium hydroxide – a well-known vaccine adjuvant – to link bioactive immune agents to the anchor. The technology platform expands the therapeutic window of cytokine drugs by forming a stable depot in the tumour after local administration.
Preclinical studies of ANK-101 revealed retention within the tumour micro-environment for up to 28 days with limited diffusion and systemic toxicity.
Monotherapy anti-tumour activity has also been seen in multiple murine tumour models and in a Phase I clinical trial of canine melanoma.
Further studies have demonstrated that ANK-101 drives the expression of local PD-L1. Pre-clinical combination studies with a PD-1 blockade have shown improved therapeutic activity in PD-1-refractory tumour models.
“ANK-101 has demonstrated therapeutic activity in several preclinical models and has been shown to strongly induce expression of PD-1 within the tumour microenvironment,” said Robert Tighe, CSO at Ankyra.
“We have also seen significant improvement in tumour responses and abscopal activity in the preclinical models when murine ANK-101 is combined with PD-1 blockade without increased toxicity.”
Combining ANK-101 and KEYTRUDA® may have significant benefits
Dr Joe Elassal, CMO at Ankyra, said: “We are especially excited about evaluating our drug in combination with pembrolizumab in the KEYNOTE-E56 trial.
“Pembrolizumab has changed the clinical landscape for many different cancers, and we anticipate that the combination of ANK-101 and pembrolizumab may allow more patients to benefit from immunotherapy.”
About ANK-101 and KEYTRUDA®
ANK-101 is a first-in-class anchored IL-12 immunotherapy designed for limited intratumoural delivery to increase immune cell infiltration into tumours. It has the potential to improve the outcomes of patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.
ANK-101 is being evaluated for the treatment of advanced solid tumours alone and in combination with KEYTRUDA®.
KEYTRUDA®, or pembrolizumab, is MSD’s anti-PD-1 therapy. KEYTRUDA® is a registered trademark of Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC, a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ, USA.

https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/why-carbon-capture-utilisation-and-storage-important/34308/,"Why is carbon capture, utilisation and storage important?","Kevin Duisters, Global Head of Carbon Strategy at STX Group, shares his take on the potential of carbon capture, utilisation and storage technologies and the challenges ahead.
As the race to halt global warming continues intensifying, finding innovative solutions to decrease carbon emissions from point sources (CCUS) or capture it directly from the atmosphere (DAC (Direct Air Capture)) is receiving increasing attention.
While these technologies offer promising opportunities, especially for hard-to-abate sectors, its viability, infrastructures, and safety are being enhanced.
By directly removing carbon emitted from industrial processes, carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) offers a quick and effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Some economic or human activities face significant challenges in reducing their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions due to the nature of their operations, technological limitations, or reliance on fossil fuels.
Those include heavy industries (e.g., steel, cement, aluminium), energy generation, transportation (e.g., aviation, shipping, heavy-duty trucks), food production (livestock farming, fertilisers), and waste management (e.g., landfills, incineration). For the so-called hard-to-abate sectors, this can buy valuable time for decarbonisation while green energy production catches up.
Additionally, CCUS can be used in conjunction with renewable energy sources such as wind and solar to provide reliable and consistent power generation, addressing the intermittency issue of these options.
There are concerns regarding its economic viability and the challenges facing the energy sector such as the possible delay in the energy transition.
One of the key arguments against the use of CCUS technology is that it could facilitate a prolonged use of fossil energy, rather than pushing investment toward low carbon and renewable energy.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states it must be a key element in the equation and carbon capture, utilisation and storage will be critical to limit global warming to 1.5° C.
Also, the International Energy Agency has indicated that CCUS could reduce global carbon dioxide emissions by 19%.
Carbon capture, utilisation and storage is still a costly investment
One of the main challenges CCUS faces is the cost of implementation. Despite having been under development for some time, considerable investment is required if the technology is to see more widespread adoption.
In this respect, support is critical to ensuring sufficient capital is invested in its development – and various initiatives have already been put in place to support this at the corporate and government level.
$125tr of climate investment is needed by 2050 to meet net zero, with investment from now until 2025 needing to triple compared to the last five years to put the world on track, according to the UNFCCC.
Also, JP Morgan’s recent decision to purchase a total of over $200m worth of carbon removal credits shows what these deployments entail and how their prominence is growing.
The UK Government, for instance, has committed to increasing green investment through its Environmental Improvement Plan – pledging up to £20bn in funding for the early deployment of carbon capture, utilisation and storage.
In March 2023, the new national strategy ‘Powering Up Britain: Net Zero Growth Plan’, set out a clear focus on ramping up clean and renewable energy sources, including wind, solar, and nuclear, as well as CCUS. This funding will unlock private investment and create jobs across the UK – notably on the East Coast, in the Northwest, and in North Wales.
Meanwhile, as part of President Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the US has pledged more than $12bn in carbon capture, utilisation and storage investments and provided critical updates to its 45Q tax credit – which gives polluting companies tax credits for carbon that is captured and stored.
The primary aim of enhancing 45Q is to make the tax credit accessible to a wider range of investors and developers, putting CCUS on the path to becoming a key decarbonisation solution for hard-to-abate industries that do not yet have the resources or technology to transition to green energy.
In addition to this landmark climate bill putting the nation on a path to 40% emissions reduction by 2030, the DOE (Department of Energy) $6bn Industrial Demonstrations Program will accelerate hard-to-abate sectors’ decarbonisation.
Low-carbon tech investment is on the rise, which can help US exporters reduce the impact of the upcoming EU CBAM (Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism) carbon tax.
Growing need for infrastructure
Another challenge in implementing carbon capture, utilisation and storage is the need for new infrastructure to support the growth of the industry. Many European countries – including Germany – lack the necessary infrastructure to properly execute CCUS.
Certainly, CCUS requires large-scale storage solutions, and many industrial sites currently being used for carbon capture are not optimal for this purpose.
And, while there are several geological formations that could potentially be used to store CO 2 , their capacity and safety are still being explored.
As such, in many cases, captured CO 2 must often be transferred over incredibly long distances to storage or utilisation facilities. This can be both energy intensive and expensive and may even mitigate some of the benefits of capturing the carbon in the first place.
If CCUS is to be implemented on a larger scale, investment in common infrastructure such as pipelines will be crucial – though determining who has the right to build and operate such pipelines remains in question.
The 2022 edition of the Global CCUS Institute’s report on the worldwide progress of these solutions revealed a list of nearly 200 CCUS facilities in various stages of development, encompassing those already operational or under construction.
Showing a significant annual growth rate of 44%, this publication emphasised the escalating commercial viability and competitiveness of CCUS across numerous nations. As of September 2022, the cumulative capacity of commercial carbon capture, utilisation and storage projects in the pipeline (operational, developmental, and temporarily suspended ventures) amounted to 244 million metric tons of CO 2 per year.
Long-term integrity and permanence
With projects typically storing CO 2 deep underground, it remains to be seen whether we could see gas leakages or even seismic activity further down the line.
Regulatory frameworks and the close monitoring and management of storage sites are key to overcoming this obstacle. In line with this, and to uphold the integrity of carbon targets, the EU has put in place the CCUS Directive, which establishes a legal framework for the environmentally safe geological storage of CO 2 – covering the entire lifetime of storage sites.
The CCUS Directive outlines extensive requirements for selecting sites for CO 2 storage, stipulating that sites can only be selected if a prior analysis shows that there is no significant risk of leakage or damage to human health or the environment.
New opportunities for carbon capture, utilisation and storage
In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, CO 2 retrieved from carbon removal (CCUS and DAC) can be repurposed to create new markets for the material and provide socioeconomic benefits.
The Sustainable Development Scenario presented by the IEA (International Energy Agency) highlights the pressing imperative to establish an estimated range of 70 to 100 new carbon capture, utilisation and storage facilities annually by 2050. This ambitious undertaking will require a substantial capital investment ranging from $655bn to $1.28tr.
Such a scale of deployment would generate significant employment opportunities, including up to 100,000 jobs in construction and approximately 40,000 operational positions responsible for overseeing and managing these facilities, according to the Global CCS Institute.
Also, enhanced oil recovery (EOR) uses captured CO 2 to create pressure within an oil reservoir to force additional oil out of a rock that would otherwise be left behind. This can increase the amount of oil extracted from a well by 20% – thus increasing efficiency and, in turn, securing a long-term revenue stream.
Another use case is the carbonation of concrete. Captured CO 2 can be used to provoke a reaction with calcium hydroxide in concrete to form calcium carbonate – strengthening the concrete and, importantly, permanently sequestering the CO 2 .
CO 2 can be reinjected into the environment to enhance plant growth in greenhouses and agricultural settings. Increasing the amount of CO 2 in the air surrounding the plants can encourage plants to grow more quickly and produce larger yields.
It can similarly be used in the cultivation of algae, which can then be used in the production of biofuel or as an important food source for livestock. Importantly, all these utilisation activities are displacing the fossil alternatives while positively impacting the underlying economics.
Looking ahead, there is no doubt that carbon capture, utilisation and storage can act as a catalyst for achieving positive climate progress. Certainly, it has an important role to play in helping reduce net greenhouse gas emissions – particularly when it comes to hard-to-abate sectors that will continue to rely on fossil fuels in the short term.
However, CCUS is not a silver bullet solution: it is just one piece of a much larger puzzle: it should be seen as a complementary technology alongside other solutions such as energy efficiency, renewable energy, and sustainable land use practices.
Cost prices per ton of CCS carbon removal or CCU carbon avoidance today are not competitive against some of their nature-based carbon offset alternatives. Clients entering carbon capture, utilisation and storage investments do so because they see the value of scaling this technology early against their anticipated future abatement costs.
These investments tend to be C- level authority, and embedding these decisions within the wider business, ESG and operational excellence strategies are imperative.
Executives and policymakers now have an important task in balancing the adoption of CCUS technologies and the wider class of Carbon Dioxide Removal credits (CDR) with alternative decarbonisation methods at the national and supranational levels.
We have to do it all and we have to do it now.

https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/total-material-recovery-state-art-battery-recycling-ev-supply-chains/37997/,Total Material Recovery: State-of-the-art battery recycling for the EV supply chain,"True 2 Materials’ state-of-the-art material recovery from end-of-life and production scrap EV batteries will ensure a competitive EV supply chain.
Global transportation markets are undergoing rapid change. We are seeing many companies involved in the transition from internal combustion engine (ICE) to electric vehicles (EVs) expanding into areas outside their traditional or core expertise. Car companies are getting into mining, and mining companies are planning on making battery cathodes or placing bets on recycling companies. Industries are expanding their scope because the marketplace has changed more rapidly than ever in the last 100 years.
A competitive advantage in EV supply chains is paramount to winning going forward. The best way to assert control over the strained materials supply is through state-of-the-art material recovery from end-of-life and production scrap EV batteries. True 2 Materials’ approach is known as Total Material Recovery (TMR).
How does TMR differ from traditional battery recycling methods?
TMR is a break from traditional recycling methods, which are themselves derived from old mining processes. There are a few ways to recycle end-of-life EV batteries and production scrap, and a handful of well-funded companies are vying for leadership in this relatively new market. We often read about the varying degrees of metal recovery, the innovation, and the pedigree of their principles.
Hundreds of articles explain how solving waste and end-of-life battery recycling can make for a profitable and cleaner EV supply chain. We indeed share this vision but are left with questions about how these companies will address recycling cleanly while preserving maximum value at minimum cost, especially when all environmental costs are fully priced. How much innovation is possible when discussing hydro and pyrometallurgy?
Increasing the value of the EV supply chain
The EV supply chain is in the very early stages, and no one can solve our most significant problems with the toolkit currently available to the leading contenders. Typical media stories do not ask meaningful questions about where we are and where we need to be to succeed as an industry. In order to further the supply chain, they must be addressed.
Media articles typically teach us that batteries are first shredded into black mass and that, from this black mass, valuable metals are extracted, often with success rates at anywhere from 90-95%. But what is in black mass?
Electrolytes make up approximately 20% of black mass. They are not metals, though they can contain small amounts of lithium. Electrolytes are, however, toxic and dangerous to dispose of. So what happens to them in the battery recycling process? Are they recycled at all? That will depend on the method of recycling deployed. As these essential electrolytes cannot be recycled at high temperatures (pyrometallurgical approaches) or with concentrated acids (hydrometallurgical approaches), an entirely new electrolyte removal step must be somehow developed and bolted on to the front, adding complexity and cost to an already complex and expensive procedure. Where is this electrolyte removal process?
Black mass also contains a large amount of graphite. Not just run-of-the-mill graphite but highly processed, high-value, battery-grade graphite. What happens to it? Is it recycled? In some cases, it is burned, and what is lost is counted as recycled as it heads out the exhaust. It can also be turned into low-grade carbon black. How much of it is lost, though, not merely downcycled? We do not know the actual numbers there, but we know there is a better way. Why destroy or downcycle this valuable resource? Estimates are that we need roughly 100 mines to produce enough graphite for future EV demand. There are currently around 20, and nowhere near the 80 potential new mining sites required. Preserving this graphite is essential.
Extensive research has gone into Froth Flotation to recover graphite. However, as another traditional mining technique, froth floatation struggles to reach the strict purity requirements for the materials used in modern battery manufacture. Yields are still poor and the remaining graphite adversely affects metal recovery. It also requires extensive pre-treatment and is difficult to scale at any cost.
TMR is a novel battery recycling approach, and with graphite and other metals entirely separated in the first step, the value preserved is not only in recovered graphite but also in increased recovery yields of the metals. Economically this makes much sense; environmentally, it is essential.
Electrolytes and carbon materials make up more than 50% of typical black mass, so why do battery recyclers talk about metal recovery exclusively? Metals are the most lucrative target for recycling in end-of-life cells, but the costs and shortages of graphite and the environmental challenges electrolytes pose are fundamental problems to solve. From our point of view, destroying value here is unforgivable.
Important questions must be addressed
The EV battery chemistry with the fastest-growing market share is lithium iron phosphate (LFP). With no nickel or cobalt, what exactly are traditional recyclers going to go after? Are the yields going to justify the costs? What kind of subsidies will be necessary to process these batteries? Or will the costs be passed on to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and hence finally, the consumers instead?
There is typically more lithium in LFP chemistries, but traditional battery recycling is suboptimal for recovering lithium. We see the can being kicked far down the road regarding this chemistry. The game plan will be a tooth-and-nail battle between recyclers over the lucrative NMC feedstock, with LFP being treated as a junk product.
Total Material Recovery (TMR) is a modern process developed in the 21st Century. Spending billions on building giga-structures for recycling based on technology that is hundreds of years old is a misallocation of capital. We want to start to see articles that pose these three questions to battery recyclers:
Why do you get your metals back as sulphates instead of oxides, and is downgrading from oxide to sulphate the best solution?
Total Material Recovery recovers all the metals from cells back as oxides.
What happens to the electrolytes and graphite in the cells you recycle? Are you recovering the expensive spherical graphite in a non-degraded form?
Total Material Recovery recovers all the graphite as it was in the battery; it can be reused. The electrolytes we recover are undegraded. They are safe and offer a pathway to re-use.
What are your plans for cells made with comparatively low-value materials such as LFP, which are capturing more market share each year? Are you planning on turning a profit from recycling them, even without any cobalt or nickel?
We must push past platitudes and general claims of being chemistry agnostic, doing good for the environment, and making the EV supply chain greener. We need to know how battery recycling impacts the need for battery materials and new mining.
The way to see what is going on is to nail down the costs of processing a given chemistry and compare that with the value recovered. The math is very simple – if the value is being destroyed, you cannot hide it. The cost of materials of an EV cell pack represents about 70% of the money spent as of autumn 2022 (they should be falling with cheaper chemistries coming onstream and lithium prices dropping). A $10,000 battery pack has approximately $7,000 of battery materials inside, but how much of that is earned back and at what cost? If the end product contains carbon black, degraded or missing electrolytes, and only 95% of the non-lithium metals, the numbers will not lie.
The great thing about Total Material Recovery is that recovering metals as high-purity oxides gives one huge flexibility. While our iron oxides could quickly be cycled back into the next generation of batteries, one could also sell them on the spot market should one desire.
We do not plan on LFP battery recycling being a money-losing venture. In addition, while competition will be good for the EV supply chain, realistically True 2 Materials does not need a large scale to hit profitability. Giga structures are optional and undoubtedly not optimal. The recycling industry has overcapacity already after all. When we consider scale for processing production scrap, clearly a smaller footprint will be more economical.
We see the future of recycling requiring better economics, and T2M looks forward to providing solutions to get us all there.

https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/protein-guard-mechanism-identified-future-infectious-disease-cancer-treatment/37988/,Protein guard mechanism identified for future of infectious disease and cancer treatment,"Researchers have found a guard mechanism for protein which attacks microbes in infected cells.
The University of Birmingham-led study has identified a guard mechanism that controls the attack protein GBP1. GBP1 is activated during inflammation and has the potential to attack membranes within cells and destroy them.
The lock and key mechanism found has opened the possibility for new treatments for Toxoplasma, Chlamydia, Tuberculosis and even cancer.
The study, ‘PIM1 controls GBP1 activity to limit self-damage and to guard against pathogen infection,’ is published in the journal Science.
How does the protein guard mechanism work?
The research showed that the attack protein is controlled through a process called phosphorylation. This process involves a phosphate group being added to a protein by enzymes called protein kinases.
The kinase targeting GBP1 is called PIM1 and can also become activated during inflammation.
In turn, phosphorylated GBP1 is bound to a scaffold protein, keeping uninfected bystander cells safe from uncontrolled GBP1 membrane attack and cell death.
The guard mechanism prevents GBP1 from attacking cell membranes indiscriminately, creating a protective shield that is sensitive to disruption by the actions of pathogens inside the cells.
The new discovery was made by Daniel Fisch, a former PhD student in the Frickel lab working on the study.
Dr Eva Frickel, Senior Wellcome Trust Fellow at the University of Birmingham, who led the study explained: “This discovery is significant for several reasons. Firstly, guard mechanisms such as the one that controls GBP1 were known to exist in plant biology but less so in mammals. Think of it as a lock and key system. GBP1 wants to go out and attack cellular membranes, but PIM1 is the key, meaning GBP1 is locked safely away.
“The second reason is that this discovery could have multiple therapeutic applications. Now we know how GBP1 is controlled, we can explore ways to switch this function on and off at will, using it to kill pathogens.”
The initial research was conducted on Toxoplasma gondii
The research team first conducted their study on Toxoplasma gondii, a single-celled parasite that is common in cats.
In South American countries, Toxoplasma infections are particularly dangerous for pregnant women and can cause reoccurring eye infections and blindness.
The team discovered that Toxoplasma blocks inflammatory signalling within cells, preventing the production of PIM1. This means that the guard mechanism disappears, allowing GBP1 to attack the parasite.
Using an inhibitor to switch PIM1 off or manipulating the cell’s genome also resulted in GBP1 attacking Toxoplasma and removing the infected cells.
Dr Frickel stated: “This mechanism could also work on other pathogens, such as Chlamydia, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Staphylococcus all major disease-causing pathogens which are increasingly becoming more resistant to antibiotics.
“By controlling the guard mechanism, we could use the attack protein to eliminate the pathogens in the body.
“We have already begun looking at this opportunity to see if we are able to replicate what we saw in our Toxoplasma experiments. We are also incredibly excited about how this could be used to kill cancer cells.”
The implications for the research in cancer treatment
GBP1 is activated by the inflammatory effect of cancer, while PIM1 is a key molecule in the survival of cancer cells.
The team believe that blocking the interaction between PIM1 and GBP1 could eliminate cancer cells.
Dr Frickel concluded: “The implication for cancer treatment is huge. We think this guard mechanism is active in cancer cells, so the next step is to explore this and see if we can block the guard and selectively eliminate cancer cells.
“There is an inhibitor on the market which we used to disrupt PIM1 and GBP1 interaction. So, if this works, you could use this drug to unlock GBP1 and attack the cancer cells
“There is still a very long way to go, but the discovery of the PIM1 guard mechanism could be a massive first step in finding new ways to treat cancer and increasingly antibiotic-resistant pathogens.”

https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/europes-first-exascale-supercomputer-jupiter-built-partec-ag-eviden/37981/,Europe’s first exascale supercomputer ‘JUPITER’ to be built by ParTec AG and Eviden,"Europe’s first exascale supercomputer, JUPITER, will be built by German quantum computing company ParTec AG, and Eviden, the Atos Group business leading in advanced computing in France.
JUPITER, or the ‘Joint Undertaking Pioneer for Innovative and Transformative Exascale Research,’ will be the first system in Europe capable of more than one exaflop/s. This number is equivalent to one million times one million times one million – a ‘one’ followed by 18 zeros – floating-point operations per second.
The number corresponds to the computing power of ten million modern notebooks.
JUPITER is set to partake in a variety of applications
The exascale supercomputer will tackle the most demanding simulations and compute-intensive AI applications in science and industry.
Applications will include:
Training large neural networks;
Simulations for developing functional materials;
Creating digital twins for medical purposes;
Validating quantum computers; and
High-resolution simulations of our climate.
The system is expected to operate for six years.
The cost of the system itself and its operation during its lifetime is expected to cost €500m.
The European Union will fund half of JUPITER, whilst the other two quarters will be funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and the Ministry of Culture and Science of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (MKW-NRW).
Modular supercomputing architecture will be implemented by JUPITER
The exascale supercomputer will consist of a highly scalable booster module and a tightly coupled general-purpose cluster module.
The cluster module will be based on SiPearl’s new Rhea processor made in Europe. This processor is a CPU with exceptionally high memory bandwidth for complex workloads.
The booster module will feature NVIDIA’s accelerated computing platform designed for next-generation data centre technologies. This will help to deliver extreme-scale computing power for AI and simulation workloads, such as training generative AI.
Eviden will integrate the components into their highly energy-efficient BullSequana XH3000 platform.
The modules are dynamically operated as a unified supercomputer using ParTec’s modular ParaStation Modulo operating system.
How will the new system impact Europe?
ParTec, Eviden, SiPearl and NVIDIA are collaborating with the European scientific community on JUPITER to give scientists AI and HPC resources needed for technological breakthroughs.
Europe’s first exascale supercomputer will lead new avenues of research and scientific discovery in Europe and around the globe.
The installation of the system will start in early 2023. More details are expected to be announced in November at this year’s SC23 conference.
Professor Dr Sabine Döring, State Secretary at the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, said: “The signing of the contract for the construction of JUPITER is another major milestone on the way of Europe entering the exascale era.
“JUPITER will be one of the leading supercomputers in the world and will therefore become a symbol of the strength of European scientific cooperation.
“It will enable scientists to achieve scientific breakthroughs in various domains like health, climate, energy, materials, and AI. We are proud to host this research infrastructure in Germany.”
Computing time allocated through peer review procedures
Europe’s first exascale supercomputer will be operated by the Jülich Supercomputing Centre as a member of the Gauss Centre for Supercomputing (GCS). The GCS is an association of the three national high-performance computing centres in Germany: Forschungszentrum Jülich (JSC), the Bavarian Academy of Sciences (LRZ), and Stuttgart University (HLRS).
The computing time is allocated to European and national projects through established peer review procedures.
GCS is supported by BMBF, the Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts of the German State of Baden-Württemberg, the Ministry of Culture and Science of North Rhine-Westphalia, and the Bavarian State Ministry of Science and the Arts.
Minister Ina Brandes, Ministry of Culture and Science of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia, concluded: “The JUPITER exascale computer is a milestone for NRW as a research location. The fact that the first European supercomputer of this new performance class is being installed in NRW underlines our leading position in high-performance computing.
“With its incredible computing power, JUPITER will help address the major societal challenges of our time. It will be particularly well suited for AI applications and further enhance Jülich´s focus on quantum computing in combination with the Jülich supercomputing architecture.”

https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/success-of-initiate-project-using-carbon-capture-and-utilisation-technology/35879/,The success of the INITIATE project using carbon capture and utilisation technology,"Antonio La Mantia, Director of Communications and Events, and Anastasios Perimenis, Secretary General at CO 2 Value Europe, explore the INITIATE project that uses carbon capture and utilisation to contribute to a climate-neutral and circular economy.
Scientists estimate that roughly 34 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide is emitted globally each year. This gives us a sense of the immense amount of CO 2 emissions going into the atmosphere yearly without being seen or very well perceived by the public.
To grasp the scale of this phenomenon, imagine putting on magic glasses able to show you just a tonne of these CO 2 emissions. We would then see a cube of about 8x8m (almost as tall, wide, and long as a utility pole) filled with carbon dioxide.
This enormous CO 2 landfill floating above our heads is identified by the global scientific community as the primary driver of climate change. However, the good news is that what has been considered so far as a waste product can be captured and become a lower-cost feedstock for several industries.
Carbon capture and utilisation technology
Thanks to a broad portfolio of existing and developing carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) technologies, carbon dioxide can be captured and converted into a feedstock to create essential products. This is particularly true for the chemical sectors, including the production of chemicals, synthetic fuels and polymers, and at the same time for the energy sector, as it can provide useful storage solutions.
The most promising aspect of these technologies is not only that they can reduce CO 2 emissions and avoid emissions but also that they can create a circular carbon economy able to de-fossilise our society, as captured CO 2 is used by the industry as an alternative carbon feedstock to create different fuels and chemicals which are part of our daily life, via the so-called Power-to-X approach.
This approach sees the use of renewable electricity (Power), water and carbon dioxide as a feedstock to convert CO 2 into products (X), like fuels, chemicals or commodity blocks. Against this context, first comes the source of CO 2 , which can be either an industrial point source like steel mills, incinerators, cement factories or the air via the so-called direct air capture. Then the approach, which can be electrochemical, thermochemical or biological, is able to form low and high-carbon molecules such as methanol, formic acid and ethylene, butanol and many others.
Captured CO 2 can also be bound in mineral-rich industrial wastes (like ashes, slags, and construction wastes) to create solid materials (e.g. carbonates, bricks, and building materials). This process, known as mineralisation, is an industrially accelerated form of natural carbonation that already occurs in nature, though at a slow pace. Mineralising carbon does not only allow us to store carbon dioxide in products for hundreds of years, but it also allows us to create products that can substitute carbon-intensive products (e.g. cement).
This broad range of carbon capture and utilisation technology pathways are not emerging technologies anymore, as some of them are already at TRL 9 (commercialisation level), while others are in this wide spectrum range of TRLs starting from one to nine, so still in labs or prototype or pilot phase.
Challenges in commercialising CCU technologies
However, the route towards the scalability of CCU technologies is also faced with several challenges. First is the business case. As CCU solutions are often energy-intensive and require a significant initial investment for their implementation, they require significant investment in the CapEx and OpEx phases.
Secondly, there might be future unpredictable competition between fossil, biogenic and atmospheric CO 2 to provide chemical feedstocks, material and fuel needs, and that shows the importance of assessing the future demand trends and potential penetration of these products via accurate marketing investigations. Third, as CCU has been envisioned as a ‘circular solution’, conflicting expectations and misconceptions may arise when it is mixed up with carbon capture and storage solutions (CCS), especially at the political level, given the different needs and challenges of these two different sectors. Fourth, when it comes to risk perception and public acceptance, it is now clear that the general public is not very well aware of CCU, and this may lead to relevant difficulties in assessing the acceptance in various areas of Europe. Last but not least, there are difficulties associated with assessing the impact of CCU technologies on the environment and the economy.
Tackling climate change with CCU
In 2022, the role of carbon capture and utilisation technology as a solution to mitigating climate change was recognised by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
In its sixth assessment report titled ‘Mitigation of Climate Change’, the UN panel not only identifies CCU technology as a solution to decrease net CO 2 emissions but also stresses the importance of its critical role to end our reliance on fossil carbon by using CO 2 as an alternative feedstock for the production of renewable fuels and chemicals.
In this context, the three major contributions of CCU technologies to mitigating climate change are:
CCU technologies are drop-in solutions with limited new infrastructure needs and have the potential to utilise up to 8 Gt of CO 2 per year by 2050; 1
per year by 2050; CCU allows to reduce or avoid CO 2 emissions while maintaining essential services historically based on fossil resources; and
emissions while maintaining essential services historically based on fossil resources; and CCU can provide CO 2 removal solutions when atmospheric or biogenic CO 2 is durably stored in products.
However, it is important to note once again that the impacts of these applications on the climate and also on the economy are contextual and dependent on various factors. The only fact that we are using CO 2 to make a product does not automatically mean that the product is good for the planet or economically viable. As such, the role of carbon capture and utilisation technology in mitigating climate change should be determined through a comprehensive and systematic full life cycle assessment (LCA) to find the best possible ways for its scalability. At the same time, the economic factors influencing its commercialisation and deployment must be assessed via techno-economic assessment (TEA) to ensure the market will ultimately engage in this technology.
As stated by the IPCC, the different solutions to mitigate climate change should be based on sobriety, energy efficiency and circularity of goods, waste, and resources. The panel has also shown that industrial symbiosis and intersectoral co-operation are key to success.
INITIATE project
Against this context, the INITIATE project brings forward a concept of industrial symbiosis to contribute to the EU’s goal for a climate-neutral and circular economy. The concept is demonstrated by coupling energy-intensive industries like the iron and steel sector and the ammonia and urea sector.
Carbon capture and utilisation technology work to capture and transform residual gases like basic oxygen furnace gases (BOFG) from steelmaking into suitable feedstocks for urea production, namely NH 3 and CO 2 used as feedstock for the production of ammonia and urea.
This is a challenge beyond the state-of-the-art, following the variability and different properties of this new circular feedstock. Overall, the transformation is happening in sequence: the first step is the steel gases conditioning, comprising a water-gas-shift (WGS) reactor and a sorption-water-gas-shift (SEWGS) reactive-separation multi columns unit. In this section, residual steel gases are conditioned and separated into CO 2 and H 2 /N 2 streams. INITIATE optimises the intermediate H 2 /N 2 product ratio to produce ammonia (NH 3 ) and, via SEWGS, decarbonises this stream.
The resulting CO 2 can be added to ammonia to produce urea, further used for the production of other carbon-containing molecules, or sent to geological sequestration. The NH 3 synthesis loop is also designed for the flexible intake of green H 2 from renewable energy electrolysis but does not rely on this for normal operation with Basic Oxygen Furnace Gas (BOFG) and Blast Furnace Gas (BFG).
INITIATE is an interdisciplinary project combining the disciplines of process modelling to model the dynamic elements of, among others, the NH 3 synthesis loop and the SEWGS multi-column process concerning the varying feed-gas composition; catalysis and functional material characterisation to identify the appropriate sorbents and catalysts to deal with contaminants in the input; engineering and process control to design, construct and test both the individual components and the integrated value chain at demonstration and full implementation scale; LCA to assess the energy, economic and environmental advantages of the process over reference cases; business model development for a bankable design of a first-of-a-kind commercial plant to convert BOFG and BFG to NH 3 -based and carbon-containing products; and communication and stakeholder engagement to ensure synergies at local and European scale and replication of the concept for future successful deployment of this CCU technology.
The INITIATE project aims at a 30% decrease in primary energy use, a 40% decrease in raw material demand and an up to 90% reduction in direct CO 2 emissions. Additionally, Europe is made more independent and robust, given the volatility of feedstock prices and trade uncertainties. Further benefits of this symbiotic concept are the provision of grid balancing services through flexibly using green H 2 and by proving CO 2 for circular use, accelerating the transition towards locally closed loop and integrated renewable energy systems.
The INITIATE project has received funding from the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 programme Ref: 958318.

Network and learn with industry peers. Learn More
Underneath just about every generative AI application for training or inference today you’ll likely find Docker containers as the primary approach to deployment.
Today at the Dockercon conference in Los Angeles, Docker Inc., the eponymous company behind the open source docker container technology, is taking a dive into the deep end of AI with a series of initiatives designed to help developers more rapidly build generative AI applications.
Among the efforts is the launch of a new GenAI stack that integrates docker with the Neo4j graph database, LangChain model chaining technology and Ollama for running large language models (LLMs). The new Docker AI product is also debuting at Dockercon, as an integrated way for developers to get AI powered insights and direction for development with containers.
The critical importance of Docker to the modern development ecosystem cannot be overstated, and the new AI efforts could have a big impact on GenAI development efforts. Docker has doubled down on its developer focus in recent years, which is an effort the company’s CEO said is paying off.

“For four years running, Stack Overflow’s community of developers has voted us number one most wanted, number one most loved developer tool,” Docker CEO, Scott Johnston told VentureBeat. “And we’re now up to 20 million monthly active developers from all around the world.”

What the Docker GenAI stack brings to developers
While the use of Docker containers to help share and deploy AI is pervasive, Johnston said that there is also a need to make development of GenAI applications easier.
GenAI applications all typically require a few core elements, such as a vector database, which is something that Neo4j now has as part of its graph database platform. Then of course GenAI requires an LLM, which is what Ollama provides with its platform that enables users to run LLMs including Llama 2, to run locally. Modern GenAI applications are also commonly multi-step, which is where LangChain fits in with its framework. Getting all those different pieces configured in containers to work together normally would require a bit of effort that can now be significantly simplified with the GenAI stack.
The Docker GenAI stack is designed to help developers and the enterprises they work for to more easily get started with AI development using containers. With the GenAI stack there are several use cases that are being targeted including the ability to build a support agent bot with a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) capability, a python coding assistant and automated content generation.
“It’s pre configured, it’s ready to go and they [developers] can start coding and experimenting to help get the ball rolling,” Johnston said.
The whole stack is designed so it can run locally on a developer system and is being made freely available. As developers build out applications and need deployment and commercial support, Johnston said that there will be options available from Docker and its partners.
Docker AI: a ‘mech suit’ for developers
There is no shortage of GenAI developer tools in the market today, with popular options such as GitHub Copilot and Amazon CodeWhisper among others.
Docker is now entering that fray with its own GenAI tool, simply called Docker AI. Rather than referring to Docker AI as a copilot, which is a term that Microsoft and other vendors are increasingly using for GenAI tools that assist users, Docker is using the term- mech suit. The basic idea is that with the mech suit, developers have more power and strength to accomplish tasks.
Docker AI has been trained on Docker’s proprietary data from millions of Dockerfiles, compose files, and error logs. Docker AI integrates directly into developers’ workflows to provide assistance when errors occur. It will display potential fixes within the development environment and allow developers to test the fix before committing changes. The goal is to create a better experience for developers to troubleshoot and fix issues when they arise.
Johsnton noted that while tools like Github Copilot are useful and powerful, Docker AI is specifically tuned to help enable container development.
“It has been trained on a rich proprietary stream of Docker data that other LLMs don’t have access to,” he said.",https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-04-at-5.20.26-PM.png?w=1200&strip=all,2023-10-05 19:18:16
