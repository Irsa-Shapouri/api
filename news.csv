Welcome, Strands players! If you're a fan of word puzzles, you're in for a treat with the New York Times' Strands puzzle. Similar to a word search, this game challenges you to find a group of words that share a common theme. But don't be fooled, it's not as easy as it seems. Let's dive in and uncover the secrets of Strands!

Before we start, here's a quick overview of how to play. Each day, a new Strands puzzle is presented to players. You'll be given a grid of letters, measuring six by eight. Your task is to find words that are connected by a common theme. Once you discover a theme word, it will be highlighted in blue. But that's not all – there's also a special word called a spangram that you need to find. This spangram connects two opposite sides of the grid and gives you a clue about the common thread among the words. While the theme words are not proper names, the spangram can be one. When you find the spangram, it will be highlighted in yellow.

Now, let's tackle today's Strands puzzle. But before we reveal the answers, let's talk about the hints. The official theme hint for today's puzzle is ""Sign language."" Additionally, we have an extra hint: ""Constellation.""

Are you ready for the answers? Here they are:

Spangram: ASTROLOGY

Once you find the spangram, it becomes easier to uncover the remaining words. However, today's puzzle was quite tricky, even for experienced players like myself. I must admit, I had to seek a few hints to crack it. Initially, I found ""Bull"" and ""Goat,"" which led me astray, as I thought I was looking for animal-related words. But that wasn't the case. Then, I stumbled upon ""Virgin,"" which left me even more confused. It wasn't until I discovered ""OLOGY"" that the pieces started falling into place. Finally, I found the key word: astrology. Suddenly, everything made sense. All the previous words were actually constellations! I continued with ""archer,"" ""twins,"" and finally ""scorpion,"" although that one gave me a bit of trouble.

On a side note, I recently watched the film Taxi Driver, and it was quite coincidental that there was a scene where astrological signs were mentioned. Life works in mysterious ways!

In the end, all's well that ends well. How did you fare with today's Strands puzzle? Let me know on Twitter and Facebook.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/24/meet-the-apps-that-tell-you-when-to-take-your-eclipse-glasses-off/,Meet The Apps That Tell You When To Take Your Eclipse Glasses Off,"When it comes to removing solar eclipse glasses, many people find themselves unsure of the right time. Attending a total solar eclipse can be an exhilarating experience, but it requires careful planning. First, you need to position yourself within the path of totality, which is a narrow strip that spans only 115 miles. Secondly, you must ensure that the sky is clear at your location. Lastly, you need to know when to remove your eclipse glasses to witness the breathtaking sight of the sun's corona.

Removing eclipse glasses can cause panic among eclipse chasers. However, the answer is quite simple: remove them when it gets dark. If you are within the path of totality, the darkness will descend quickly as the moon's shadow passes over you. This moment is unmistakable and impossible to miss. On the other hand, if you are not in the path of totality, it will not get dark, so you should continue to use your glasses.

For those who prefer a more immersive experience, there are now smartphone apps available that provide audio guidance during a solar eclipse. These apps not only instruct you on when to remove your glasses but also guide you through various phenomena that occur during the eclipse, such as shadow bands, Baily's beads, and the diamond ring effect. Some popular apps include the Eclipse Company's app ""Pro"" version, the Solar Eclipse Timer app, and OneEclipse.

The Eclipse Company's app offers real-time weather updates, cloud forecasts, and a countdown timer with a vibration alert to safely remove your glasses. It also provides detailed information about local eclipse events and alerts you to look for specific phenomena. The Solar Eclipse Timer app, developed by eclipse chaser and educator Gordon Telepun, is an excellent choice for photographers. It even includes a ""Photographer's Mode"" developed with the help of ex-NASA eclipse calculator and photographer Fred Espenak. Lastly, OneEclipse, created by Astronomers Without Borders and Simulation Curriculum, supports a glasses recycling program and allows you to simulate the eclipse from any location on Earth.

These apps primarily rely on audio instructions, so it is recommended to use them with earphones. Instead of using earbuds that block out external sounds, consider using bone conduction earphones for a more inclusive experience.

In conclusion, understanding when to remove solar eclipse glasses is essential for fully appreciating this celestial event. Whether you choose to rely on the natural darkness or utilize smartphone apps for guidance, be sure to enjoy the experience safely. Remember to check for the latest updates on the total solar eclipse, including travel and lodging options, to make the most of this awe-inspiring phenomenon. Here's to clear skies and unforgettable moments!","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65e701ccb41a29b8a2fd120f/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3094,1451,x0,y304,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 19:00:00,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have had similar growth trajectories, despite their different core businesses. AWS discovered that it could sell the internal services it had created for itself, while Nvidia realized that its GPU, initially designed for gaming, was well-suited for processing AI workloads. This led to explosive revenue growth for both companies.

Nvidia's revenue has been growing at triple digits, moving from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024 to $22.1 billion in Q4 2024. However, the majority of this growth came from the company's data center business. AWS, on the other hand, has consistently been a big revenue driver for Amazon, and both companies have enjoyed a first-mover advantage in their markets.

As web apps and mobile emerged around 2010, the cloud became a valuable resource for on-demand computing power. Enterprises began to realize the benefits of moving workloads to the cloud instead of maintaining their own data centers. Similarly, the rise of AI and large language models coincided with the increased use of GPUs for processing these workloads.

While AWS has become a tremendously profitable business, with a run rate close to $100 billion, its growth has started to slow down. In contrast, Nvidia's growth is accelerating. The question is whether Nvidia can sustain this growth and become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS.

Nvidia does have other businesses besides GPUs, but they are smaller revenue generators that are growing more slowly. However, in the short term, Nvidia's financial outlook is positive. The company expects to generate $24 billion in revenue in its current quarter, representing a growth rate of 234% compared to the previous year.

Analysts predict that Nvidia will generate $110.5 billion in revenue for its current fiscal year, an increase of over 81% from the previous year. While this growth rate is lower than the previous year's 126%, it is still impressive. It is clear that there is significant growth potential for Nvidia in the coming quarters.

AI is likely to be a major driver of growth for Nvidia in the next few years, even as competition from other chipmakers such as AMD and Intel increases. Nvidia currently has a dominant position in the market, but it will face stiffer competition in the future. However, the company is well-positioned to maintain its market share.

In conclusion, Nvidia has a bright future ahead with the potential to become a long-term revenue powerhouse. Its strong growth in recent quarters and its control over the market suggest that it will continue to thrive even as competition increases. With AI as its driving force, Nvidia is well-positioned for success in the coming years.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2024/03/24/samsung-has-new-price-offer-promotion-for-galaxy-s24-phone-buyers/,Samsung Has New Price Offer Promotion For Galaxy S24 Phone Buyers,"Samsung recently launched its latest phones, the Galaxy S24, S24 Plus, and S24 Ultra, which have been well-received for their capabilities and performance. However, the high price tag may have deterred some potential buyers. Thankfully, Samsung has introduced trade-in promotions in the U.K. and the U.S., allowing customers to trade in their old phones for discounts on the new devices.

Let's start with the U.K. promotion. Samsung is offering a trade-in discount of $126 (£100) on any smartphone, regardless of its condition. Yes, you read that right—even if your phone has a broken display or a short battery life, you can still benefit from this offer. In fact, Samsung's website states that you can save up to £370 by trading in various brands of phones, including Samsung, Apple, Google, and Huawei.

To give you an idea of the potential savings, trading in a Google Pixel 7 Pro can earn you a discount of £270, while an Apple iPhone 14 can get you £300 off. If you happen to own a Samsung Galaxy S23, you can enjoy a whopping £320 discount. These discounts are significant and make the new Samsung phones much more affordable.

The trade-in process is simple. Once you determine the value of your old device, you can apply for the discount when purchasing the new phone. You will need to provide the IMEI number and current condition of your old phone. After purchasing the new device, you will need to wipe the data from your old phone, remove the SIM card, and send it back to Samsung using the provided freepost packaging within seven days.

It's important to note that failing to send your trade-in device to Samsung will result in the purchased phone being blocked. Therefore, it's crucial to adhere to the terms and conditions of the trade-in offer. For more information on the U.K. trade-in offers, visit Samsung's website.

Now, let's move on to the trade-in offers in the U.S. Here, customers can also take advantage of attractive trade-in deals. For example, trading in a Galaxy S23 Ultra would typically earn you a $450 discount on a new Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. However, Samsung has increased this discount by $300, bringing the total savings to a whopping $750. Similarly, trading in a Galaxy Z Fold5 would previously get you a $500 discount on the new Ultra, but now you can enjoy a $750 discount.

If you're considering switching from Apple to Samsung, you're in luck. By trading in an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max, you can save $750 on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. Previously, the discounts on these devices were $520 and $540, respectively. Even if you own a smartphone from another Android brand, you can still enjoy a $100 discount.

In the U.S., Samsung has specific requirements for trade-ins. The device must be in good condition, meaning it turns on and the screen works normally. The charging port should be functional, and the battery should hold a charge. Additionally, there should be no cracks on the front, back, screen, or camera lenses. Activation locks must be disabled, accounts removed, and the phone factory reset. It's also important to ensure that the device is not on any banned lists.

While the requirements may seem specific, the discounts available are substantial. To explore the trade-in deals in the U.S., visit Samsung's website.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/techcrunch-mobility-the-wheels-are-starting-to-come-off-the-fisker-ev-bus/,TechCrunch Mobility: The wheels are starting to come off the Fisker EV bus,"TechCrunch Mobility is a weekly newsletter that covers all things transportation. In this edition, we'll discuss the recent developments in the automotive industry, including new regulations proposed by the Biden Administration. These regulations aim to set stricter standards for U.S. automakers and promote the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs).

The Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have both released proposed standards that will impact automakers and consumers. The DOE's proposal includes a ""petroleum equivalency factor"" that assigns a score to EVs under the government's corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. The original proposal would have made it difficult for automakers to meet these standards, resulting in hefty fines. However, the revised proposal is more lenient, providing some relief to the industry.

On the other hand, the EPA's proposal focuses on tailpipe standards for cars and light-duty trucks from 2027 to 2032. These standards impose stricter requirements on automakers but allow more flexibility in meeting them through various powertrains. Unlike the initial proposal, which required EVs to make up 67% of the U.S. passenger vehicle market by 2032, the revised standards are technology agnostic. This means automakers can comply without fully transitioning to battery electric vehicles.

While these regulations have minimal impact on EV startups like Rivian, Tesla, and Lucid, they do pose challenges for legacy automakers. These companies are investing heavily in EV development but still rely on profits from internal combustion engine vehicles. Plug-in hybrids may emerge as the winners in this scenario.

In other news, we have updates on various startups in the mobility industry. Clevon, a company specializing in autonomous delivery technology, was facing financial difficulties, but it has managed to secure a merger agreement with an American electric vehicle company. The deal is expected to be finalized by June.

Uber, known for its ubiquitous presence, has made its first investment in an Africa-founded startup. Moove, a mobility fintech company, raised $100 million in a Series B funding round led by Uber. Moove offers vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers, aligning with Uber's goal of achieving a fully zero-emission fleet by 2040.

Additionally, Amber, a startup focused on aftermarket Tesla extended warranties, raised $3.18 million in a seed round. Candela, an electric boat maker, secured $25 million in funding from investors including Groupe Beneteau. Pelikan Mobility, a French startup, also made headlines with its innovative scooter-sharing service.

These developments highlight the ongoing advancements and investments in the mobility sector. As the industry continues to evolve, we can expect more exciting news and innovations in the future.

That wraps up this week's edition of TechCrunch Mobility. Stay tuned for more updates on the future of transportation.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1363022906.jpg?resize=1200,730",2024-03-24 19:00:33,Innovation,Innovation

Gen.G regained their momentum in the third map, Ascent, with another 13-8 victory, putting them on the brink of victory. However, Sentinels showcased their resilience and fought back on Split, securing a 13-10 win and forcing a decisive final map.

The final showdown took place on Icebox, and the tension was palpable as the scores remained level at 5-5 after the first 10 rounds. Sentinels then capitalized on a crucial opportunity, winning two rounds before the break to establish a 7-5 lead going into the second half. After the break, Sentinels continued their impressive performance, extending their lead to 9-5. Although Gen.G managed to secure another round, it marked the end of their success. Sentinels ultimately triumphed with a convincing 13-6 victory, securing both the map and the championship title.

Sentinels' first-place finish earned them a prize of $250,000, while Gen.G received $100,000 for their second-place finish. Paper Rex claimed third place, earning $65,000, and LOUD secured fourth place, taking home $35,000.

Despite Sentinels' victory, Gen.G was initially considered the favorite, having defeated Sentinels in the upper bracket final just days prior. Throughout the tournament, Gen.G showcased their dominance, going undefeated in the Swiss stage with wins over Loud and EDward Gaming. They continued their winning streak by defeating Paper Rex, the team that ultimately finished third, in the knockout stage. This victory set the stage for their initial encounter with Sentinels, which they won 2-1.

Sentinels also displayed their strength en route to the final, achieving a flawless record in the Swiss stage with victories over Team Heretics and Karmine Corp. They then defeated Loud in the knockout stage before facing Gen.G in a closely contested match. Despite their loss to Gen.G, Sentinels bounced back, defeating Paper Rex to secure their spot in the final and seek redemption.

In addition to the thrilling matches, the Valorant Masters Madrid tournament introduced a new agent named Clove. This agent's unique ability allows them to resurrect themselves and create smoke screens from beyond the grave.

Valorant Masters Madrid was a captivating display of skill and determination, culminating in Sentinels' well-deserved victory. The competition showcased the intense rivalry between Sentinels and Gen.G, with both teams delivering exceptional performances. As the Valorant esports scene continues to evolve, fans eagerly anticipate future tournaments and the emergence of new talent.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600832a1389114562dc7741/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 17:13:21,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewwight/2024/03/24/helping-patients-access-sickle-cell-disease-treatments-in-west-africa/,Helping Patients Access Sickle Cell Disease Treatments In West Africa,"A researcher from Cameroon is on a mission to help patients in low-income countries in West Africa afford the medicine they need for sickle cell disease. With over 4 million people worldwide affected by the disease, the majority of cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa. Unfortunately, 89% of women in central and west Africa lack access to universal medical coverage. Dr. Marthe-Sandrine Eiymo Mwa Mpollo, a scientist and co-founder of NaYa Health, recognized the need for affordable medication and founded a digital patient assistance platform to address this issue.

NaYa Health aims to support underserved patients living without insurance by providing timely access to medication, even when they are short on cash. They offer various solutions such as community savings, deferred payments, and a portable health-only savings account to help manage health risks and safeguard earnings. Through a pilot implementation in Cameroon's capital, NaYa has already made a positive impact by boosting the ability of informal workers to handle unexpected challenges, increasing income for local medical providers, and ensuring guaranteed access to critical services.

NaYa Health's efforts have not gone unnoticed, as they were selected in the financial inclusion challenge by MIT Solve. Dr. Mpollo expresses her satisfaction in fulfilling the promise of research findings and enabling patients with sickle cell disease in Cameroon to access the medicines they need without delay, even when facing financial constraints.

Dr. Mpollo's passion for medicine traces back to her upbringing in Cameroon. She vividly remembers watching ""doctors without borders"" shows in the late 1980s and being made aware of the impact that sickle cell disease has on families in her community. This inspired her to pursue a career in healthcare, initially aiming to become a medical doctor. However, her journey led her to life science research in Canada and the US, where she obtained a doctorate from the Faculty of Medicine of Cincinnati. Her focus was on developing therapies for sickle cell disease, a genetic disease that disproportionately affects individuals of African descent.

Through her research and scientific publications, Dr. Mpollo realized that access to medication is crucial for research to achieve its full life-saving potential. This realization led to the creation of NaYa Health, as she recognized the need for affordable and accessible healthcare solutions tailored to the unique challenges faced by communities in the Global South. By working closely with local actors, NaYa Health aims to define or adapt scientific findings to better serve their communities.

Meanwhile, in Zambia, a team of entrepreneurs, researchers, and health professionals are utilizing artificial intelligence to improve care for pregnant women. Despite a significant decrease in Zambia's death rate for pregnant mothers between 2000 and 2017, there is still a 1% risk of maternal mortality. Tafadzwa Kalisto Munzwa, founder and CEO of Dawa Health, has developed the DawaMom project, which leverages AI-tools, last-mile health workers, mobile clinics, and digital tools to enhance maternal and child health.

Dawa Health has over 60 community health workers supporting in-community healthcare through the DawaMom platform, with over 800 mothers signed up. The platform utilizes generative AI models that are patient-facing and responsive to patient needs. This innovative approach aims to address the challenges faced by pregnant women in Zambia and improve their access to quality healthcare.

Both NaYa Health and Dawa Health exemplify the power of innovation and technology in addressing healthcare disparities in low-income countries. By leveraging digital platforms and AI-tools, these organizations are making a significant impact on the lives of patients and mothers in need. Through their efforts, they are improving access to medication and quality healthcare, ultimately saving lives and improving the well-being of communities in the Global South.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66009a73668df974c31e0a4f/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=579,579,x127,y431,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 17:54:08,Innovation,Innovation
