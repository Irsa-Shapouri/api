It Cut Air Pollution So We Can Breathe Easier.,"On red air days, when pollution levels spike, the metallic taste of contaminated air lingers in your mouth, leaving a burning sensation in your nose and lungs. During these times, it's crucial to stay indoors and avoid outdoor activities, especially for vulnerable groups like the elderly, children, pregnant women, and those with respiratory issues.

The primary culprit behind toxic air pollution in many areas is internal combustion engines running on gasoline or diesel. With over two-thirds of Americans relying on personal vehicles for daily transportation, the transportation sector has become the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. Light-duty vehicles alone contribute to nearly 60% of the sector's climate pollution.

To combat this pervasive air pollution problem, we need to focus on reducing tailpipe emissions from vehicles. The good news is that we have a powerful tool at our disposal to achieve cleaner air and a healthier environment: tailpipe emissions standards.

Recently, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) took a significant step by implementing new multi-pollutant regulations for light-duty and smaller medium-duty vehicles. These rules aim to limit tailpipe pollution, which not only harms our health but also exacerbates climate change. By enforcing updated standards, automakers are compelled to adopt advanced clean technologies to ensure that new vehicles are cleaner than ever before.

It's essential for everyone to have the option to choose a clean car for their next vehicle. Those who are concerned about reducing pollution should have the opportunity to drive electric vehicles.

Despite the clear benefits of these updated pollution limits, some entities are trying to undermine the EPA's efforts. Corporations that profit from selling polluting vehicles and fossil fuels view these standards as a threat to their bottom line. They argue that these regulations infringe on consumer choice and freedom.

In reality, the updated pollution limits are long overdue and will benefit all Americans by improving air quality and offering consumers the choice to transition away from expensive fossil fuels. While some groups have launched disinformation campaigns to mislead the public about the EPA's standards, it's crucial to understand the facts.

The EPA's standards are technology-neutral, performance-based, and grounded in scientific research. The Clean Air Act, enacted in 1970, empowers the EPA to establish National Ambient Air Quality Standards to safeguard public health and regulate hazardous air pollutants. Over the years, these standards have driven innovation in engine and emission control technologies, leading to significant reductions in harmful emissions.

Before the Clean Air Act was enacted, major cities like New York and Los Angeles grappled with severe air pollution, with air quality levels comparable to smoking multiple packs of cigarettes daily. The implementation of emissions standards and the development of new technologies, such as catalytic converters and unleaded fuel, have played a crucial role in improving air quality and protecting public health.

As we navigate towards a cleaner and healthier future, it's important to support initiatives that prioritize environmental protection and public health. By embracing cleaner technologies and advocating for stricter emissions standards, we can create a more sustainable and resilient society for generations to come.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fe401fc35aefb76700b52e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 07:45:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) may seem like two completely different companies, but they actually share a lot in common. Both companies stumbled upon their core businesses by accident. AWS discovered that it could sell the internal services it had created for itself, while Nvidia realized that its gaming GPU was also well-suited for processing AI workloads. This realization led to explosive revenue growth for both companies.

Nvidia's revenue has been growing at an astounding rate, moving from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024 to $22.1 billion in Q4 2024. However, the majority of this growth came from its data center business. On the other hand, AWS has consistently been a major revenue driver for Amazon. Both companies were in the right place at the right time, as the emergence of web apps and mobile devices coincided with the rise of cloud computing and the use of GPUs for AI workloads.

While AWS has become a highly profitable business, its growth has started to slow down. Nvidia, on the other hand, is experiencing a surge in growth. The question is whether Nvidia can sustain this growth and become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS. If the GPU market tightens, Nvidia does have other businesses, but they are smaller revenue generators that are growing at a slower pace than the GPU data center business.

In the short term, Nvidia's revenue growth is expected to continue. The company anticipates $24 billion worth of revenue in its current quarter, a 234% growth compared to the year-ago first quarter. However, as the company's revenue ramps up, its growth rate is expected to decline. Analysts predict that Nvidia will generate $110.5 billion worth of revenue in its current fiscal year, an 81% increase from the previous year. While this growth rate is lower than in previous years, Nvidia is still expected to scale its revenue past the $100 billion annual run rate mark.

AI is expected to drive Nvidia's growth in the coming years, even as competition from other chipmakers like AMD and Intel emerges. Nvidia currently dominates the chip market, but AMD is gaining ground at the board level. Despite the competition, Nvidia's market control allows it to withstand the pressure.

In conclusion, Nvidia and AWS may have different origins, but they have experienced similar growth trajectories. Both companies stumbled upon their core businesses by accident and have seen explosive revenue growth. While AWS has started to slow down, Nvidia's growth is expected to continue, driven by the AI market. The future holds both challenges and opportunities for Nvidia, but the company is well-positioned to maintain its status as a revenue powerhouse.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/24/debunked-i-think-ive-seen-a-total-solar-eclipse-before/,Debunked: ‘I Think I’ve Seen A Total Solar Eclipse Before’,"Total Solar Eclipses in North America: A Once-in-a-Lifetime Experience

Have you ever witnessed a total solar eclipse? If you think you have, chances are you're mistaken. Many people believe they've seen a total solar eclipse when, in reality, they've only experienced a partial eclipse. Total solar eclipses, where the moon completely blocks the sun, are incredibly rare events that leave a lasting impression on those lucky enough to witness them.

To truly understand why so many people misremember their eclipse experiences, it's important to recognize that witnessing a total solar eclipse requires significant effort. You must be in the path of totality, the specific area on Earth where the moon fully obscures the sun. If you're not within this path, you'll only see a partial eclipse. This fact alone raises suspicion when someone claims to have seen a total solar eclipse.

In recent years, North America has been going through a golden age of eclipses. The most notable event was the ""Great American Eclipse"" in 2017, which brought totality to 12 U.S. states from Oregon to South Carolina. Approximately 12 million people lived within the path of totality, and an additional million traveled to witness this awe-inspiring phenomenon. If you were fortunate enough to be in the path of totality, you'd remember the breathtaking twilight-like sky, the moon's silhouette, and the ethereal sight of the sun's corona shining brilliantly around it. It's an experience that stays with you forever.

To determine if your eclipse memory is accurate, consider the details. Many people claim to have seen an eclipse during their school or work days, often involving solar eclipse glasses or pinhole cameras. However, it's highly likely that their memory is from the 2017 partial solar eclipse that was visible across North America. To confirm the authenticity of an eclipse memory, you can consult the Solar Eclipses Visibility Database, which provides information on eclipse locations.

To help you better understand the rarity of total solar eclipses, here is a list of all the total solar eclipses that have occurred in North America over the past 70 years, courtesy of GreatAmericanEclipse.com. If you weren't within the designated path on the specified dates, you did not witness a total solar eclipse. Any dates not listed indicate a partial eclipse.

Now, imagine encountering someone who believes they've seen a total solar eclipse. Engage them in conversation, asking them to recall when and where it happened and to describe the experience of totality. Then, gently inform them about the upcoming once-in-a-lifetime event on April 8, 2024. This total solar eclipse will be visible to an astonishing 42 million people, including 32 million Americans, who already reside within the path of totality.

On April 8, 2024, everyone in North America will witness a partial solar eclipse. However, only those within a narrow 115-mile path spanning parts of Mexico, 15 U.S. states, and Canada will be able to witness the awe-inspiring totality. The path will traverse five states in Mexico, 15 U.S. states, and six Canadian provinces, offering a truly remarkable experience to those lucky enough to be in its trajectory.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/apple-sued-microsofts-ai-ambitions-and-nvidia-surprises/,"Apple sued, Microsoft's AI ambitions and Nvidia's surprises","Welcome to this edition of Week in Review, where we bring you the latest updates on Apple's antitrust lawsuit and Microsoft's AI ambitions. Let's dive right in.

The U.S. has joined international regulators in accusing Apple of using monopolistic tactics to lock in iPhone users. In response, Apple claims that the actions of the Department of Justice (DOJ) could ruin the very things that users enjoy about its phones and ecosystem.

While the DOJ's lawsuit draws a comparison between Apple and Microsoft in the 1990s, there are key differences between the two companies and their efforts to retain customers. It is unlikely that much will come out of the lawsuit in the short-term, as experts predict it could take three to five years to reach a resolution.

But that's not all. We have more updates for you on Reddit's IPO, Nvidia's GTC event, and an unexpected change for Glassdoor accounts.

In other news, Microsoft has acquired the co-founders of Inflection AI, a prominent startup in the AI industry. This deal positions Mustafa Suleyman as the lead of Microsoft AI's consumer-facing unit and Karén Simonyan as the EVP and CEO of the same group. Inflection AI had recently raised $1.3 billion, with Microsoft being the biggest investor.

At Nvidia's GTC developer conference, CEO Jensen Huang made some surprising announcements. He predicted that artificial general intelligence would be achievable within the next five years and introduced a new AI platform for humanoid robots called GR00T.

Google and Apple are reportedly in talks that could lead to the deployment of Google's AI model on iPhones. This raises questions about whether this collaboration is a temporary solution until Apple's own AI efforts catch up, a long-term partnership, or simply a negotiation that may not come to fruition.

Moving on to hacking and privacy concerns, the Biden administration is forming an international coalition to fight against commercial spyware. Interestingly, some investors in this coalition were previously involved in the very business they are now fighting against.

In the gaming world, a hacker disrupted a $5 million Apex Legends tournament to bring attention to an exploit used in the game. Additionally, Glassdoor users have reported that their real names are being added to their profiles without consent. The only solution provided to them is to delete their accounts entirely.

In the funding and IPO space, Reddit's IPO had a strong start, with the stock jumping 48% on its first day. Astera Labs, a company that manufactures connectivity hardware for cloud computing data centers, also saw a successful IPO, with its stock closing at $62.03 on the first day.

Lastly, The Browser Company, the startup behind the Arc browser, has raised $50 million at a valuation of $550 million. The company has an ambitious and controversial take on supplanting PCs with browsers, but their path to monetization remains unclear.

In our bonus round, we take a look at why AI-generated images often have spelling errors. Despite its massive potential, AI still struggles with spelling simple words like ""burrito."" We also discuss Fisker's production pause, which is due to a lack of capital. If they are unable to raise more funds, they may have to cease operations.

While systems like ChatGPT or Gemini are impossible to truly review, it is important to continue testing and evaluating them to ensure their effectiveness.

That wraps up this edition of Week in Review. Stay tuned for more updates in the tech world.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/apple-antitrust-doj-splash.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-23 20:15:37,Innovation,Innovation
