Here's the good, the bad, and the ugly","DevOps engineering is a highly sought-after profession in today's job market. However, this role requires a combination of technical expertise and business acumen. To succeed in the field, one must be dedicated to continuous learning, as industry trends evolve rapidly.

The demand for DevOps engineers, who oversee the automation and collaboration of cloud and on-premises environments to ensure seamless software development and deployment, is skyrocketing. These professionals are well-compensated, with an average salary of around $134,000 per year in the US.

But what does it take to be a successful DevOps engineer? According to Brad Morgan, a seasoned DevOps engineer, a strong foundation in Linux is essential. Regardless of the specific tasks involved in a DevOps role, Linux knowledge is crucial. Familiarity with the operating system, command-line interface, and basic commands is a must.

In addition to Linux, bash scripting is another key skill that DevOps engineers should possess. Bash scripting is widely used in the DevOps world to automate tasks. Understanding how to write and execute scripts can significantly enhance efficiency and productivity.

Cloud skills are also highly valued in the DevOps field. Familiarity with major cloud providers, such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure, can open doors to exciting opportunities. Instead of trying to master multiple cloud platforms simultaneously, it is recommended to focus on one provider at a time. This approach allows for a deeper understanding of the chosen platform and facilitates the transition to others in the future.

Becoming a DevOps engineer does not require following a formal learning path. Self-learning and constant curiosity are key attributes for success in this field. The DevOps ecosystem is vast and ever-evolving, with new tools and frameworks emerging regularly. DevOps professionals need to dedicate their free time to stay up-to-date and continuously enhance their skills.

According to ""Homebrew Henry,"" another experienced DevOps engineer, the learning process never stops, even as one gains more experience. DevOps engineering is a dynamic field, and the introduction of technologies like ChatGPT and AI will continue to shape its future. Embracing the constant learning curve is part of what makes this job exciting for many professionals.

One aspect that sets passionate DevOps engineers apart is their enthusiasm for infrastructure management. Managing infrastructure is a significant part of the job, involving tasks like setting up, configuring, and maintaining cloud infrastructure. This responsibility includes dealing with servers, databases, networks, and security on a daily basis. Those who enjoy these aspects find fulfillment in their work.

However, it is important to note that DevOps engineering may not be a perfect fit for everyone. If a person's interest lies primarily in software engineering and building customer-facing applications, the infrastructure-focused nature of DevOps may not align with their preferences. Nevertheless, it is possible to transition between software engineering and DevOps, as many professionals have successfully done so.

Another consideration for aspiring DevOps engineers is the business side of the role. It is common for businesses to have unrealistic expectations and assume that hiring a few DevOps engineers will solve all their problems. In reality, DevOps is a complex discipline that requires careful planning, collaboration, and continuous improvement. Managing these expectations is crucial for the success of both the engineers and the organization.

In conclusion, becoming a DevOps engineer is a rewarding career choice with high demand and excellent compensation. While the role requires technical expertise in areas like Linux, bash scripting, and cloud platforms, it also demands a commitment to lifelong learning. DevOps professionals must stay updated on industry trends and continuously enhance their skills. Passion for infrastructure management and an understanding of the business side of DevOps are also essential for success in this field.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/e4d3d8d263eb00323161fcf2566ad35a3fe52282/2024/03/25/1b8b924e-2629-43c2-b416-1b990e262786/gettyimages-1319039490.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/can-you-hear-me-now-ai-coustics-to-fight-noisy-audio-with-generative-ai/,Can you hear me now? AI-coustics to fight noisy audio with generative AI,"Can you hear me now? AI-coustics to fight noisy audio with generative AI

Noisy audio recordings can be a headache for audio engineers. However, a German startup called AI-coustics aims to tackle this issue using generative AI technology to enhance the clarity of voices in videos. Recently, AI-coustics emerged from stealth mode with €1.9 million in funding. According to Fabian Seipel, the co-founder and CEO of AI-coustics, their technology goes beyond standard noise suppression and can work with any device and speaker.

The core mission of AI-coustics is to improve the clarity of digital interactions, whether it's a conference call, consumer device, or casual social media video. Seipel, who is an audio engineer, founded AI-coustics in collaboration with Corvin Jaedicke, a machine learning lecturer at the Technical University of Berlin. Both of them encountered poor audio quality in online courses during their studies at TU Berlin, which led them to work on improving speech quality and intelligibility.

While there are already AI-powered software solutions available for noise suppression and voice enhancement, AI-coustics claims to have a unique approach to developing its AI mechanisms for noise reduction. The startup uses a model trained on speech samples recorded in its studio in Berlin. People are paid to record samples, which are then added to the data set used to train AI-coustics' noise-reducing model. The training process also involves simulating audio artifacts and problems like noise, reverberation, compression, and distortion.

There may be concerns about AI-coustics' compensation scheme for creators, as the model they are training could potentially be lucrative in the long run. Additionally, bias is another important consideration. Speech recognition algorithms have been known to develop biases that harm users. To combat this, AI-coustics is focused on recruiting diverse speech sample contributors to eliminate bias and make the technology work for all languages, speaker identities, ages, accents, and genders.

To test AI-coustics' capabilities, three video clips were uploaded to its platform—an interview with an 18th-century farmer, a car driving demo, and an Israel-Palestine conflict protest. The processed clips had significantly less ambient background noise, delivering on AI-coustics' promise of boosting clarity.

Seipel envisions AI-coustics' technology being used for real-time as well as recorded speech enhancement. It could potentially be embedded in devices like soundbars, smartphones, and headphones to automatically improve voice clarity. Currently, AI-coustics offers a web app and API for post-processing audio and video recordings, as well as an SDK for integrating its platform into existing workflows, apps, and hardware.

AI-coustics generates revenue through a combination of subscriptions, on-demand pricing, and licensing. The startup currently has five enterprise customers and 20,000 users. Their plans for the future include expanding their team and improving the underlying speech-enhancing model.

AI-coustics has come a long way since its lean beginnings and is now supported by a substantial network of investors and mentors in Germany and the UK. With their unique approach to improving audio quality using generative AI, AI-coustics aims to revolutionize digital interactions and make clear communication accessible to everyone.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1009979808.jpg?resize=1200,801",2024-03-25 18:43:01,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/boeing-ceo-to-leave-company-by-year-end-after-a-wave-of-safety-incidents/,Boeing CEO to leave company by year-end after a wave of safety incidents,"Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun is set to step down from his position by the end of 2024. This decision comes in the wake of a series of safety incidents and controversies that have plagued the aircraft manufacturing company.

One of the incidents that have raised concerns about Boeing's safety standards is a cabin panel blowout on one of its planes. This incident, along with several others, has raised questions about the company's commitment to ensuring the safety of its passengers.

Boeing has been actively involved in an innovation acceleration program called Aerospace Xelerated, which was previously known as the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI). This program aims to collaborate with startups in the aerospace industry. It remains to be seen how Calhoun's departure will impact this program, and TechCrunch has reached out to Aerospace Xelerated for comment.

In a statement, Calhoun expressed his intention to focus on stabilizing and positioning the company for the future in the coming months. This suggests that he recognizes the need to address the issues that have plagued Boeing and work towards improving the company's reputation.

One incident that has significantly impacted Boeing's safety record is the emergency landing of an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 jet in January. This incident led to the grounding of 171 Max 9 jets for several weeks. It is worth noting that this is not the first time Boeing has faced a safety crisis, as two of its Max 8 jets crashed in 2018 and 2019, resulting in the tragic loss of 346 lives.

Amidst these developments, Boeing has also announced that Stan Deal, who heads the company's commercial airplanes business, will be leaving the company. Stephanie Pope has been appointed to lead the commercial airplanes business. Pope has extensive experience in the aviation industry, previously serving as the president and CEO of Boeing Global Services.

As more information becomes available, this story will continue to develop and be updated accordingly. It is clear that Boeing is facing significant challenges, and the departure of its CEO and other executives reflects the company's commitment to addressing these issues. The aerospace industry will be closely watching as Boeing takes steps to regain trust and ensure the safety of its aircraft.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1910140688.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-25 12:48:28,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-household-robots-common.html,Engineering household robots to have a little common sense,"Robots are becoming increasingly skilled at performing various household tasks, from cleaning spills to serving food. Many of these robots learn through imitation, where they copy the motions guided by a human. However, robots often struggle to handle unexpected situations or disruptions that deviate from their trained path. To address this issue, engineers at MIT have developed a method that combines robot motion data with the ""common sense knowledge"" of large language models (LLMs).

The new approach allows robots to break down complex tasks into subtasks and adjust their actions based on disruptions within each subtask. This means that robots can continue their tasks without starting from scratch or requiring explicit programming for every possible failure. Yanwei Wang, a graduate student at MIT, explains, ""With our method, a robot can self-correct execution errors and improve overall task success.""

The researchers demonstrate their approach using a simple task of scooping marbles from one bowl and pouring them into another. Traditionally, engineers would guide the robot through the entire task in one continuous motion, which the robot would then mimic. However, the team realized that tasks can be broken down into a sequence of subtasks. For example, reaching into the bowl, scooping the marbles, and moving to the empty bowl are individual subtasks.

If a robot encounters a mistake or disruption during any of these subtasks, it typically has to start over unless engineers explicitly label each subtask and program new demonstrations for recovery. This level of planning is time-consuming and tedious. Instead, the researchers found that language models can automate some of this work. These models process vast amounts of text and can generate new sentences based on what they have learned.

In addition to sentences and paragraphs, language models can produce a logical list of subtasks based on a given task. For example, if asked to list the actions involved in scooping marbles, the model might generate ""reach,"" ""scoop,"" ""transport,"" and ""pour."" By connecting the language model's understanding of the task with the robot's physical position or state, the researchers enable the robot to know its progress and make adjustments autonomously.

The team developed an algorithm that maps the natural language labels of subtasks to the robot's physical coordinates or an image representing its state, a process known as ""grounding."" This algorithm allows the robot to understand which stage of the task it is in and replan or recover as needed.

The combination of robot motion data and language models provides robots with a sense of common sense and the ability to adapt to disruptions, ultimately improving their overall task performance. The researchers will present their findings at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024).

The development of this method has significant implications for the advancement of household robots. By equipping robots with the ability to self-correct and adjust their actions, they become more reliable and efficient in performing complex tasks. This technology could revolutionize the way robots are programmed and trained, making them more adaptable and capable of handling real-world scenarios.

Going forward, the researchers plan to explore the application of their method to a broader range of tasks and further improve the performance and reliability of household robots. The ultimate goal is to create robots that can seamlessly integrate into everyday life, assisting with various household chores and tasks, while also being able to handle unexpected situations. With the combination of imitation learning and language models, robots are on their way to becoming more intuitive and intelligent helpers in our homes.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/engineering-household.jpg,2024-03-25 09:48:20,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/dma-first-formal-probes/,"Apple, Google and Meta face first formal investigations under EU's DMA","What’s the collective noun for investigations on Big Tech? Because the European Union has just announced a pile of probes on gatekeepers designated under the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Alphabet/Google, Apple, and Meta are facing the first formal non-compliance investigations under the bloc’s rebooted ex ante competition rulebook.

Alphabet/Google’s rules on steering in Google Play and its approach to self-preferencing in search results are in the frame. For Apple, the EU is also looking at its rules on steering in the App Store and the design of choice screens for alternatives to its Safari web browser. While Meta’s “pay or consent” model will be scrutinized by the Commission.

In total, five investigations were announced Monday — less than three weeks since the compliance deadline kicked in for the companies earlier this month.

The three gatekeepers, which were designated under the pan-EU market power and contestability regulation last fall, face formal investigation in these areas to determine whether they are breaching the rulebook, as the Commission suspects. Confirmed violations of the DMA can result in fines of up to 10% of global annual turnover, or even 20% for repeat offenses.

The EU will have up to 12 months to conclude the investigations, per recommended timeframes in the DMA. A preliminary report can be produced within six months. Although senior Commission officials noted Monday that the probes may conclude sooner or could take longer than these guidelines.

The enforcement action by the bloc comes as antitrust scrutiny continues to dial up on the three U.S. firms on home turf, too.

Since the three companies unveiled their DMA compliance plans, there has been a range of criticism that the proposals do not comply with the new EU law.

Google has been accused of seeking to avoid the regulation’s ban on self-preferencing by launching new rich features in search results that compete unfairly with rivals. While Apple’s use of notifications to users warning them of risks of stepping outside its walled garden has been attacked by developers as “scare screens,” among a number of criticisms. And Meta’s ‘pay or be tracked’ tactic has been roundly condemned as exploitative abuse by privacy and consumer rights groups. (Earlier this month the Commission sent Meta questions about this under the DMA’s sister regulation, the Digital Services Act, too.)

“The Commission has opened proceedings to assess whether the measures implemented by Alphabet and Apple in relation to their obligations pertaining to app stores are in breach of the DMA. Article 5(4) of the DMA requires gatekeepers to allow app developers to “steer” consumers to offers outside the gatekeepers’ app stores, free of charge,” the Commission wrote, saying it’s concerned the pair’s steering measures “may not be fully compliant as they impose various restrictions and limitations”, pointing for example to constraints on developers’ ability to “freely communicate and promote offers and directly conclude contracts”.

On concerns about Google self-preferencing, the EU said the investigation will focus on Google’s vertical search services (e.g., Google Shopping; Google Flights; Google Hotels) and the impact its action may have on similar rival services.

“The Commission is concerned that Alphabet’s measures implemented to comply with the DMA may not ensure that third-party services featuring on Google’s search results page are treated in a fair and non-discriminatory manner in comparison with Alphabet’s own services, as required by Article 6(5) of the DMA,” it wrote.

On Apple, the EU will also look at whether it’s complying with a range of user choice obligations on iOS — including enabling end users to easily uninstall apps; easily change default settings; and prompt users with choice screens which it says “must effectively and easily allow them to select an alternative default service, such as a browser or search engine on their iPhones”.

“The Commission is concerned that Apple’s measures, including the design of the web browser choice screen, may be preventing users from truly exercising their choice of services within the Apple ecosystem, in contravention of Article 6(3) of the DMA,” it added.

On Meta, the EU said the proceedings will investigate whether its recently introduced “pay or consent” model for EU users complies with Article 5(2) of the DMA, noting that this portion of the regulation “requires gatekeepers to obtain consent from users when they intend to combine or cross-use their personal data across different core platform services”.

“The Commission is concerned that the binary choice imposed by Meta’s ‘pay or consent’ model may not provide a real alternative in case users do not consent, thereby not achieving the objective of preventing the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers,” it said.

Responding to a question about this probe during Monday’s press conference, the EU’s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, said the DMA puts a clear requirement on gatekeepers to offer a free, non-paying option to users.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1031626648.jpg?resize=1200,799",2024-03-25 12:10:10,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/gostudent-tutoring-profitability/,"GoStudent, the online learning platform, says it's now profitable","GoStudent, the Austrian online tutoring marketplace, has achieved profitability, making it one of the few successful startups from Vienna. The company, valued at $3.2 billion, boasts 11 million families and 23,000 tutors on its platform. CEO Felix Ohswald revealed that GoStudent is not only EBITDA profitable but also has positive operating cash flow across its global operations. However, the path to profitability has been challenging, with the company experiencing significant losses and undergoing rounds of layoffs and cost cuts.

GoStudent experienced a period of hypergrowth, scaling its core business model to over €100 million in revenue within just a few years. However, the company also faced a cash burn of over €150 million in 2022 alone. As the market crashed for online learning companies, GoStudent had to reevaluate its strategy. Despite raising significant funding, the company realized it could not sustain its current trajectory. It reduced its burn rate by 70% in 2023 but still needed to make further changes to achieve profitability.

To cut costs, GoStudent made various adjustments, including eliminating extravagant parties, halting acquisitions, and refraining from expanding into new markets where online tutoring was not already established. The company also exited the U.S. market and shifted its focus to Europe, adopting a more organic growth strategy. GoStudent aims to become the leading global school, but it recognizes the need to balance growth with cost reduction. 

One of the ways GoStudent plans to evolve its business model is through the acquisition of Studienkreis, a physical learning center with 1,000 locations primarily in Germany. GoStudent sees a future in hybrid learning, combining online tutoring with in-person learning centers. CEO Felix Ohswald believes that personalized tutoring, facilitated by technology, is the key to unlocking the potential of every student.

Most of GoStudent's tutors are university students, which allows them to better connect with pupils while providing a personalized learning experience. The company's goal is to match each student with the right tutor, regardless of location. By leveraging technology and its extensive tutor network, GoStudent aims to revolutionize education and create a global impact.
