https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-vulnerability-virtual-reality.html,Vulnerability in virtual reality systems identified,"Virtual reality systems have opened up a whole new world of possibilities, allowing users to immerse themselves in virtual environments. However, a team of computer scientists at the University of Chicago has recently uncovered a potential vulnerability in these systems that could have serious implications. They have identified a way for hackers to insert what they call an ""inception layer"" between a user's VR Home Screen and their VR User/Server.

In their paper, which has been posted on the arXiv preprint server, the researchers explain how this inception layer could be used by hackers to deceive users and gain access to sensitive information. The idea behind the app is that it creates a layer of reality that is altered and controlled by the hacker, without the user's knowledge. This layer could be used to record passcodes entered into virtual ATMs, intercept and alter financial information, or even manipulate the user's perception of the virtual world.

To demonstrate the potential impact of this vulnerability, the researchers conducted an experiment using a demonstration VR headset. They enlisted the help of 28 volunteers who played a game while wearing the headset. Without the volunteers' knowledge, the researchers downloaded an app onto the devices that simulated a hacking attempt. Surprisingly, only 10 of the volunteers noticed any unusual activity, and just one of them questioned whether something nefarious was occurring.

The implications of this vulnerability are significant. If a hacker is able to gain access to a user's VR device, either by hacking their WiFi network or physically gaining access, they could install this app without the user's knowledge. Once installed, the app can run undetected, monitoring or altering the user's gestures, voice emanations, browsing activity, and social or business interactions. It could even create virtual representations of friends or family members to gain the user's trust.

The researchers have shared their findings with Meta, the company behind the Meta Quest VR system used in their experiment. Meta has responded by stating that they will investigate the potential vulnerability and take steps to address it if necessary. However, the researchers caution that similar vulnerabilities are likely to exist on other VR systems and apps that seek to insert themselves between users and their devices.

This discovery serves as a reminder that as technology continues to advance, so do the methods used by hackers to exploit it. It is crucial for both developers and users to remain vigilant and take steps to protect themselves from potential threats. As virtual reality becomes more integrated into our daily lives, ensuring the security and privacy of these systems will be of paramount importance.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/vulnerability-in-virtu.jpg,2024-03-25 10:20:02,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/can-you-hear-me-now-ai-coustics-to-fight-noisy-audio-with-generative-ai/,Can you hear me now? AI-coustics to fight noisy audio with generative AI,"Can you hear me now? AI-coustics to fight noisy audio with generative AI

Noisy audio recordings can be a major headache for audio engineers. But a German startup called AI-coustics aims to solve this problem using generative AI technology to enhance the clarity of voices in videos. With â‚¬1.9 million in funding, AI-coustics has emerged from stealth and is ready to make waves in the industry.

According to Fabian Seipel, the co-founder and CEO of AI-coustics, their technology goes beyond standard noise suppression. It is designed to work across any device and speaker, making digital interactions, whether on a conference call or social media video, as clear as a professional studio broadcast. Seipel, an audio engineer, joined forces with Corvin Jaedicke, a lecturer in machine learning, to start AI-coustics in 2021. They were inspired by their experiences with poor audio quality in online courses and tutorials during their studies at the Technical University of Berlin.

The market for AI-powered noise-suppressing and voice-enhancing software is already robust, with competitors like Insoundz and Veed.io. However, AI-coustics sets itself apart with its unique approach to developing AI mechanisms for noise reduction. They train their model using speech samples recorded in their Berlin studio. Paid contributors record these samples, which are then added to the dataset for training the noise-reducing model. AI-coustics also simulates audio artifacts and problems during the training process, such as noise, reverberation, compression, and distortion.

While AI-coustics' compensation scheme for creators may raise some concerns, the startup is focusing on recruiting diverse speech sample contributors to eliminate bias. They believe that size and diversity are key to making the technology work for all languages, speaker identities, ages, accents, and genders.

To test the effectiveness of AI-coustics' technology, I uploaded three video clips to their platform: an interview with an 18th-century farmer, a car driving demo, and an Israel-Palestine conflict protest. The processed clips had significantly less ambient background noise, making the speakers' voices much clearer.

Seipel envisions AI-coustics' technology being used for real-time speech enhancement and even embedded in devices like soundbars, smartphones, and headphones to automatically improve voice clarity. Currently, AI-coustics offers a web app and API for post-processing audio and video recordings, as well as an SDK for integrating their platform into existing workflows, apps, and hardware.

With five enterprise customers and 20,000 users (both paying and non-paying), AI-coustics is already making an impact. Their plans for the future include expanding their team and improving the speech-enhancing model. They generate revenue through subscriptions, on-demand pricing, and licensing.

AI-coustics' journey has been challenging, but with their network of investors and mentors in Germany and the U.K., they are well-positioned for success in the audio industry. Their innovative approach to noise reduction using generative AI technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we experience audio in our digital interactions.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1009979808.jpg?resize=1200,801",2024-03-25 18:43:01,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/elon-musk-x-ccdh-california-lawsuit-dismissed/,A judge just killed Elon Musk's lawsuit against an anti-hate research org,"A federal judge has ruled against Elon Musk and X, dismissing their lawsuit against the nonprofit organization, the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH). X had sued CCDH, claiming that the group spread misleading information through a series of reports on hate and extremism. They also accused CCDH of scraping data illegally and violating platform rules. However, the judge sided with CCDH, stating that X's true purpose was to punish CCDH for criticizing their company.

The CCDH, which was formed in 2018, focuses on researching hate speech, extremism, and misinformation on major social networks. Their research has uncovered disturbing content on various platforms, including TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram. By highlighting these issues, CCDH aims to hold social media companies accountable for their decisions that impact society.

In response to the ruling, CCDH CEO Imran Ahmed expressed his satisfaction, stating that the court affirmed their right to research, speak, and advocate for better online environments. He emphasized the importance of holding social media companies responsible for decisions that affect fundamental human rights and civil liberties.

The lawsuit against CCDH was personally directed by Elon Musk, who referred to the organization as an ""evil propaganda machine."" However, the judge's ruling dismisses the claims made by X and denies them the opportunity to relitigate the case.

While this is a victory for CCDH and researchers tracking online extremism, Elon Musk is pursuing a similar lawsuit against the left-leaning media watchdog, Media Matters for America. Unlike the CCDH lawsuit, this case is being pursued in Texas, which lacks the same protections against frivolous lawsuits designed to stifle free speech.

It is worth noting that this ruling reinforces the importance of free speech and the right to criticize and hold accountable powerful entities, even those with vast wealth and influence. Roberta Kaplan, CCDH's legal representative, highlighted the significance of the decision, stating that it demonstrates that no individual, regardless of their wealth, can manipulate the rule of law to suit their own interests.

In conclusion, the federal judge's ruling in favor of the Center for Countering Digital Hate is a victory for free speech and the right to research and advocate for a safer online environment. It serves as a reminder that even influential individuals like Elon Musk cannot disregard the rule of law. As the fight against hate speech and extremism continues, organizations like CCDH play a crucial role in holding social media platforms accountable for their actions.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/twitter-x-logo-musk-pattern.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-25 20:33:17,Innovation,Innovation

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-method-quantum-mechanics-lithium-metal.html,New method that uses quantum mechanics can lead to improved lithium metal batteries,"In a recent study published in Nature Energy, researchers Dr. Perla Balbuena and Dr. Jorge Seminario from Texas A&M University have made significant progress in understanding the impact of external pressure on lithium-metal batteries. By using quantum mechanics, they have developed a new method that can improve the fabrication processes of lithium-metal batteries, leading to longer-lasting and more efficient battery technologies.

Lithium-ion batteries have played a crucial role in the advancement of mobile electronics, enabling the development of compact devices that can easily fit in our pockets. These batteries are used in various applications, including smartphones, laptops, electric vehicles, and grids. However, they still face limitations, with one of the most significant being their energy density, which is restricted by the battery components.

The functioning of lithium-ion batteries relies on two essential electrodes that convert lithium ions into neutral species and store their energy as chemical energy. These neutral species can then be transformed back into ions, allowing the transport of their energy as electrical energy. The anode, or the negative electrode, holds the lithium ions at their maximum energy level, while the cathode, or the positive electrode, has the ions at their minimum energy level. This energy difference causes the lithium ions to migrate from the anode to the cathode during discharge, along with the flow of electrons to power the external device.

To overcome the limitations of current lithium-ion batteries, researchers have been exploring alternative materials. One promising avenue is the replacement of the conventional graphite anode with lithium metal, which could potentially enhance energy density by a factor of ten. However, lithium metal is highly reactive, and innovative control measures are required. One such measure is the application of external pressure to the battery. While external pressure has been known to have a significant effect on cell performance, there is limited research on the relationship between external pressure and the electroplating of lithium in large-format pouch cells.

The Texas A&M research team focused on understanding how pressure can lead to a more uniform distribution of lithium ions on the anode, preventing the formation of dendrites that could potentially short-circuit the battery. Using theoretical-computational techniques, they meticulously analyzed the effects of pressure on lithium-metal anodes.

Through their research, the team discovered that lithium ions have a tendency to detour towards regions with elevated pressure or a higher concentration of lithium atoms on the surface. This behavior is influenced by the electric field generated by the lithium-metal anode. Understanding this behavior allows researchers to predict the electrodeposition of lithium ions on the anode surface.

This finding is significant as it provides insights into the behavior of lithium ions and opens up possibilities for the use of novel materials in lithium-metal batteries. By predicting the behavior of ions in these conditions, researchers can develop lithium-metal batteries with improved performance, longer battery life, and increased functionality, all while using less expensive infrastructure and fabrication processes.

The research conducted by Dr. Balbuena and Dr. Seminario is part of the ongoing efforts of the Battery500 Consortium. This consortium is a collaboration between national labs and academia, led by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, dedicated to developing more reliable and high-performing vehicle batteries. Their work aligns with the goals set by the Department of Energy to advance battery technologies.

In conclusion, this study sheds light on the impact of external pressure on lithium-metal batteries. By employing quantum mechanics, researchers have gained a deeper understanding of the behavior of lithium ions under pressure. This knowledge can significantly contribute to the development of longer-lasting and more efficient lithium-metal batteries, bringing us closer to a future with advanced energy storage technologies.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/new-discovery-can-lead.jpg,2024-03-25 17:06:08,Innovation,Innovation

Last year, GSS raised a similar amount of funding from notable investors, including Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). For their latest funding round, GSS has attracted backing from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), Cynosure Group, and AlixPartner.

Financial institutions often find themselves at the forefront of sanctions enforcement due to their role in overseeing global money flows. However, it can be challenging for these institutions to determine who is sending money to whom. In the past, major banks such as Standard Chartered and BNP Paribas have faced hefty fines for breaching sanctions and inadequate money-laundering controls.

In light of these challenges, investors have increasingly supported regulatory compliance businesses. Last year, New York-based Droit raised $23 million, while London's SteelEye secured $21 million in financing.

GSS offers a sanctions-screening platform that helps banks and other financial institutions comply with regulations. These institutions input transaction data into GSS's cloud-based platform, which then cross-references the data against a standardized set of sanctions lists from around the world. GSS also enriches these lists with additional data points, such as dates of birth and International Maritime Organization (IMO) numbers for ships. The company also provides enhanced lists for screening, including companies that are partly owned by sanctioned individuals, companies, or governments.

With the recent funding, GSS is transitioning from the development phase to becoming fully operational. The company is preparing to onboard its first customers and launch its services to the market.

In conclusion, GSS has secured significant funding to support its efforts in helping financial institutions meet their global sanctions obligations. The company's sanctions-screening platform provides a comprehensive solution for compliance with regulatory requirements. With the backing of prominent investors, GSS is poised to make a significant impact in the industry as it prepares to go live with its first customers.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1770041999-e1711386339681.jpg?resize=1200,677",2024-03-25 18:36:37,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-high-efficiency-based-copperiodide-clusters.html,A high efficiency LED based on copper-iodide clusters,"A team of researchers led by Prof. Yao Hongbin from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) has made a significant breakthrough in the development of high-efficiency, high-brightness warm white light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Their innovative work, which utilizes copper-iodide cluster hybrids, has recently been published in the esteemed journal Nature Photonics.

Solution-processed LEDs are widely recognized as the technology that will pave the way for the future of large-area solid-state lighting. This is due to their simple manufacturing process and high operability. Various types of solution-processed LED devices, such as those based on lead-halide perovskites, organic semiconductor materials, and colloidal core-shell quantum dots (QDs), have already demonstrated impressive electroluminescence performance.

However, there are significant challenges associated with the materials used in these devices. For instance, lead-halide perovskites and CdSe QDs contain heavy metals that pose serious environmental concerns. On the other hand, LED devices based on organic light-emitting molecules, InP QDs, and ZnSe QDs have high production costs due to their complex synthesis. Consequently, it is crucial to develop solution-processed LEDs that are based on low-cost, low-toxicity, easily scalable, and highly efficient emitters.

In order to address this challenge, Prof. Yao's team embarked on a research endeavor to design and prepare a copper-iodine-based hybrid cluster with a broad photoluminescence spectrum. By introducing nitrogen-phosphine chelating ligands and phosphine-containing solubilizing ligands, the team successfully obtained copper-iodide hybrid clusters that exhibited both high luminescence efficiency and high solubility. These clusters displayed an exceptional solubility of over 200 mg/mL and demonstrated good structural stability in N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF), which is a cross-solvent commonly used in LED production.

The team then fabricated luminescent thin films through spin-coating in DMF. These films showcased a low surface roughness of 0.22 nm and an impressive photoluminescence quantum yield of over 70%. Consequently, they could be utilized as a luminescent layer to create low-cost warm-white LED devices through an orthogonal solvent route.

The resulting LED devices exhibited outstanding performance. They achieved a maximum external quantum efficiency of 19.1%, a brightness exceeding 40,000 cd m-2, and an operational lifetime of over 232 hours (T50 @100 cd m-2). Furthermore, owing to the excellent solubility and processability of the clusters, the team successfully constructed a large-area solution-processed LED device with a working area of 36 cm2 using the blade-coating technique. This device emitted warm white light with a brightness close to 60,000 cd m-2.

Additionally, by modifying different electron-donating groups on the nitrogen heterocycles of the nitrogen-phosphine chelating ligands, the team was able to develop a series of solution-processed color-tunable LED devices.

The breakthrough achieved by Prof. Yao's team opens up new possibilities for the development of LED devices with high efficiency and high brightness. The structural expandability and spectral tunability of the copper-iodide hybrid clusters make them highly promising for the fabrication of low-cost, high-performance LED panels and solid-state lighting.

In conclusion, the research conducted by Prof. Yao Hongbin and his team represents a significant advancement in the field of LED technology. Their innovative use of copper-iodide cluster hybrids has resulted in the development of high-efficiency, high-brightness warm white LEDs. This breakthrough brings us one step closer to achieving the goal of cost-effective and environmentally friendly solid-state lighting. The potential applications of this technology are vast, and it is likely to have a profound impact on various industries ranging from lighting to display technology.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/ustc-designs-high-effi.jpg,2024-03-25 13:17:52,Innovation,Innovation
