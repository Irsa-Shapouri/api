Instead of a simple list of links, you might now be greeted with an AI-powered answer. This new feature, which was initially introduced to users enrolled in Google Labs, is now being rolled out to a wider audience.

According to a report from Search Engine Land, Google is currently testing this feature on a small percentage of search traffic in the U.S. The AI summaries are included in searches where Google is confident in the quality and value of the generated answer. In some cases, the AI-generated summary is considered a better response than the traditional links.

The main objective of this rollout is to gather feedback from real-world users who have not opted into receiving these summaries. By doing so, Google hopes to fine-tune the feature before potentially implementing it on a broader scale.

However, accuracy concerns have been raised regarding these AI summaries. It's important to note that these summaries are not truly AI-generated but rather a rewording of text from the source pages. If you want to read more on a particular topic, clicking on the link will take you directly to the source.

This means that the AI summaries may not provide answers for topics that do not have a clear source. Additionally, users cannot ask the AI to simplify or reword the results. The summaries are based on existing information and are not capable of generating new content.

From a website perspective, this new feature pushes organic search results further down the page, potentially reducing the number of clicks to the source. However, it is possible that the websites used by Google to create these AI summaries may experience an increase in traffic as users seek more information.

If you haven't yet seen this feature, you can still join Google Labs to test it out and provide feedback. This gives you the opportunity to experience the AI summaries firsthand and contribute to their development.

Overall, this new AI-powered search feature from Google represents a shift in how search results are presented. While it may raise some accuracy concerns, it also has the potential to provide users with quick and concise answers to their queries. As Google continues to refine this feature based on user feedback, we can expect further improvements in the future.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/0bdf12e716830d41bd5eb09af85c3f8528b8cf44/2024/03/26/950a375e-45c1-4293-8c82-da76e576a941/google-ai-summaries.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-26,Innovation,Innovation
