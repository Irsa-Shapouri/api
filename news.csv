But before we dive into that, let me share a quirky Easter idea with you. Have you ever thought about making rabbit pot pies for Easter? The deliciousness of the dish combined with the irony of using rabbit meat could make for an interesting culinary experience. Maybe it's something to consider for next year.

Now, let's get back to Wordle. But before we reveal the answer, let's go through some hints and clues. The hint for today's Wordle is that it's useful when dry but useless when wet. And the clue is that the word begins with a consonant. Intriguing, isn't it?

Now, for the moment you've been waiting for, let's unveil the answer to today's Wordle. Drum roll, please... it's ""towel""! Did you manage to guess it correctly? If not, don't worry, Wordle can be quite tricky sometimes.

Speaking of Wordle, have you ever wondered how your guesses compare to others? Well, you can check your Wordles with Wordle Bot to see how you did. It's always interesting to see how your score stacks up against others.

For me, today's Wordle was a bit of a rollercoaster. My first guess was ""chain,"" which left me with a staggering 681 words. Thankfully, I managed to narrow it down to just 19 with the word ""slope."" Not bad, right? But I didn't stop there. Inspired by today's Strands puzzle, I took a leap of faith and guessed ""towel."" And guess what? It worked! Sometimes, it's all about trusting your instincts.

Unfortunately, my competitive Wordle score was a total wash. I didn't score any points for guessing in four attempts, and I didn't even tie with the Bot. Zeroes all around! But hey, that's part of the fun of Wordle, right? It keeps you on your toes and challenges your word-guessing skills.

Now, let's take a moment to appreciate the etymology of the word ""towel."" Did you know that it traces its origins back to the Old French term ""touaille""? This term made its way into English around the 13th century. The Old French word ""touaille"" likely derived from the Medieval Latin term ""tovaglia,"" which in turn is believed to have come from the Latin word ""tubicula,"" meaning ""tube"" or ""cloth."" The evolution of this word reflects the item's purpose in daily life – a piece of cloth used for drying or wiping.

It's fascinating to see how the Norman Conquest of England in 1066 influenced the English language. The pronunciation and spelling of many words of French origin were gradually Anglicized over time. This linguistic evolution led to the modern English word ""towel"" that we use today. Throughout the centuries, towels have been a household staple, adapting in material and use, but always serving the fundamental purpose of drying or wiping.

And that brings us to the end of today's Wordle adventure. I hope you had as much fun as I did. If you're hungry for more Wordle guides or interested in TV shows, streaming guides, movie reviews, video game coverage, and much more, be sure to check out my blog.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/liquid-death-vc-beverage-startup-coke-pepsi/,Liquid Death is just one of many VC-backed beverage startups ready to disrupt Coke and Pepsi,"Liquid Death is a venture-backed beverage startup that is making waves in the industry. Despite being in a category that doesn't typically attract investors, Liquid Death has managed to raise over $267 million in funding. This success can be attributed to its disruptive brand and potential to challenge legacy players like Pepsi and Coke.

One of the ways that Liquid Death has differentiated itself is by taking inspiration from beer marketing and shelf placement. This approach has allowed them to find success not only on grocery store shelves but also at events, bars, and restaurants. By positioning themselves as a healthier alternative to alcohol, they have tapped into a market of consumers who want to have fun without the need for alcohol. This strategy has proven to be effective, as evidenced by the success of other non-alcoholic brands like Not Beer.

Not Beer, a premium sparkling water brand launching in April, is targeting consumers who are opting to drink less alcohol. Founder Dillon Dandurand recognizes that Gen Z drinks less than previous generations but still wants to have fun. By offering a beverage that provides a nice buzz without getting wasted, Not Beer is catering to this market. Dandurand acknowledges that getting noticed in a crowded market can be challenging, but he believes that taste and branding are key factors that can set a brand apart.

Water isn't the only category that is attracting startups and venture capital investment. Beverages that feature vitamins, minerals, supplements, and botanicals are also gaining traction. Companies like Odyssey, which infuses its drinks with lion's mane and cordyceps mushrooms known for their cognitive clarity and increased energy effects, have raised significant funding. Similarly, better-for-you soda startups like Olipop and Poppi have raised over $50 million in venture funding. Lemon Perfect, a healthy lemonade alternative, has raised over $70 million in cash from VC firms, athletes, and celebrities.

In conclusion, venture-backed beverage startups like Liquid Death are disrupting the industry by offering innovative and healthier alternatives to traditional beverages. With creative marketing strategies and a focus on taste and branding, these startups are challenging the dominance of legacy players like Pepsi and Coke. As the beverage industry continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how these startups shape the market and capture the attention of consumers.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-12-at-8.59.39-PM.png?resize=1200,809",2024-03-23 15:00:08,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/mallard-bay-airbnb-for-guided-hunting-and-fishing/,Mallard Bay is the Airbnb for guided hunting and fishing,"Americans spent over $144.8 billion on fishing and hunting in 2022, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Guided hunting and fishing trips are a significant part of this industry, traditionally booked offline via phone calls and paid for in cash or checks. Mallard Bay, a Houston-based startup, aims to revolutionize this process by providing an online marketplace for consumers to easily find and book guided tours, similar to booking a hotel. Additionally, Mallard Bay offers a vertical SaaS platform for outfitters to manage their back-office operations and access marketing services.

Recently, Mallard Bay secured a $4.6 million Series A funding round led by Soul Venture Partners, with participation from Acadian Capital Ventures and other angel investors. The idea for Mallard Bay stemmed from a hunting mishap experienced by co-founder and CEO Logan Meaux during a trip with his father. This incident inspired him to create a platform that simplifies the booking process for hunting and fishing excursions. The company's initial focus was to develop a marketplace akin to Airbnb for guided hunts. However, feedback from outfitters encouraged them to expand their offerings, leading to the development of Guidetech, Mallard Bay's back-office solution.

By collaborating with influential figures like Toby Brohlin, a hunting influencer, Mallard Bay has gained traction in the market. Brohlin alone has generated over $1 million in gross bookings on the platform, contributing to the platform's overall success. Mallard Bay facilitated over $6 million in gross bookings in 2023 and is projected to reach $30-$35 million in 2024.

Despite facing challenges in securing investors due to misconceptions about the hunting and fishing industry, Mallard Bay emphasizes the importance of ethical practices and conservation. The company believes that responsible hunting and fishing contribute to wildlife conservation efforts, highlighting the positive impact of these activities when conducted sustainably.

Mallard Bay's rapid growth since its launch in 2021 is a testament to the demand for innovative solutions in the outdoor industry. With a 600% year-over-year increase in bookings, Mallard Bay has proven its potential in a niche market that continues to grow. The success of hunting-related companies like HLRBO further underscores the untapped opportunities within this sector.

As outdoor activities gain popularity, the need for streamlined tech solutions becomes evident. Mallard Bay's success reflects a broader trend in the industry, where traditional outdoor activities are transitioning to online platforms for enhanced accessibility and convenience. The potential for growth and innovation in this space is vast, offering opportunities for startups like Mallard Bay to thrive and reshape the outdoor recreation landscape.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/greysen-johnson-cZVzzFadTMc-unsplash.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-23 16:00:34,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/23/google-upgrade-samsung-s24-s23-pixel-towards-apple-iphone-15-pro-max/,Google Suddenly Reveals Surprise Android Update That Beats iPhone,"Android and iPhone are becoming more similar than ever before, with both operating systems and their respective handsets offering comparable features. In a surprising turn of events, Google has managed to outshine Apple with a new and impressive feature that will be available on Android first.

Google has been actively working towards making Android more similar to iPhone in order to compete for users in the smartphone market. Recently, Google has made significant improvements to Android's security, added WhatsApp calls to its phone dialer, and even incorporated Apple passes into its wallet. Now, with this latest update, Google not only matches an existing feature on iPhone, but goes beyond it.

Previously, I reported on Google's endeavor to include an emergency satellite service as a new feature. This addition will finally bring Android up to par with the satellite SOS functionality that iPhone has had for a few years. In fact, Google's offering seems to include a ready-made Garmin rescue service as part of the package. This is a major step forward in ensuring the safety and security of Android users.

One limitation of Apple's emergency SOS feature is that it is only intended for emergencies. This means that for those of us who are not mountaineers or sailors, the SOS tag on the screen remains unused and irrelevant. However, with the latest Android 15 developer preview, it appears that Google is bridging this gap by allowing users to expand their cellular accounts to include a satellite add-on. This will enable core messaging apps to utilize the satellite network, eliminating the frustration of experiencing cellular black spots.

According to Mishaal Rahman, Android 15 DP2 introduces certain UI elements to ensure a consistent user experience for devices that support satellite connectivity. The update also expands platform support for satellite connectivity by introducing a new API that apps can utilize to detect when a device is connected to a satellite. Additionally, Android 15 allows SMS/MMS/RCS apps to use satellite connectivity for sending and receiving messages.

The ability for messaging apps to utilize satellite connectivity is the most significant aspect of this update. We know that some networks have plans to offer LEO satellite connectivity as an account option. This is an improvement from our initial expectations when Google prematurely updated Pixel phones with a ""Satellite SOS"" feature located between Car Crash Detection and Emergency SOS.

In comparison, Apple's satellite connectivity remains more limited. According to Apple, with iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15, or iPhone 15 Pro, users can connect their iPhones to a satellite to text emergency services, request roadside assistance, and share their location with friends and family, even when they are off the grid without mobile or Wi-Fi coverage.

There was hope that Android would go even further, as previous beta code hinted at a satellite messaging option in partnership with T-Mobile. The potential implications of this were highlighted when Elon Musk announced that SpaceX had achieved download speeds of 17mbps to an unmodified Galaxy S21 Ultra. According to SamMobile, this device would not require any special hardware to connect to a satellite, allowing smartphones to make and receive calls and messages directly from a satellite, even in areas without conventional cellular network coverage. Starlink has been testing such a service, and it looks like we may be able to use it in the near future.

While the future holds the promise of direct-to-phone satellite connectivity becoming more commonplace and usable, the integration of messaging services is an excellent start. The fact that this feature is coming to Android 15 is now confirmed, barring any major changes. As Android and iPhone continue to converge, it seems that Google is leading the way with Apple likely to follow suit. This news comes shortly after reports that Gemini might be coming to iPhone, and Apple's claim that the DOJ lawsuit would essentially turn iPhone into Android, making this an interesting week in the world of smartphones.

Update 3/23: Exciting new details about Google's plans for satellite messaging have emerged following the news that Gemini might be coming to Apple's iPhone. This development is intriguing on multiple fronts. Not only does it indicate that the gap between Android and iPhone is narrowing, but it also suggests that Google will play a significant role within the iPhone ecosystem.

This is particularly noteworthy in the ongoing Android versus iPhone debate. Android's faster deployment of Gemini on its handsets is just another example of Android outpacing iPhone. While Apple users eagerly await details about the upcoming fall OS, Android users are already benefitting from the advancements made possible by Gemini.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65d79ec3dadcd6b682668331/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-23 19:17:25,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianmazique/2024/03/23/ufcs-dana-white-cuts-fighter-immediately-after-he-bit-an-opponent/,UFC’s Dana White Cuts Fighter Immediately After He Bit An Opponent,"Pressure and combat sports can push athletes to their limits, sometimes resulting in unexpected and shocking behavior. The most recent incident occurred at UFC Fight Night: Ribas vs. Namajunas, where newcomer Igor Severino made a grave mistake in his debut.

During his preliminary bout against fellow Brazilian Andre Lima, Severino resorted to biting his opponent in the second round. This unsportsmanlike conduct led to his disqualification, as the images clearly showed bite marks on Lima's arm. The incident took place while Severino had Lima in a standing grappling position.

Severino, a 20-year-old with potential, had a chance to make a name for himself in the UFC. However, his actions on Saturday night will make it difficult for him to secure a future in the promotion. This incident will likely tarnish his reputation and hinder his career progression.

The defeat against Lima marked Severino's first loss, dropping his record to 9-1. Meanwhile, Lima maintained his unbeaten streak at 8-0. UFC CEO Dana White wasted no time in making a decision, promptly cutting Severino from the organization. White expressed his disappointment, stating, ""Those were two up-and-coming undefeated fighters. If you're frustrated and want to quit, there are numerous ways to do it, but biting your opponent is the worst choice. Now, not only has he lost his biggest opportunity, but he will also face consequences with the NSAC.""

Although biting incidents in combat sports are not entirely unheard of, they are always highly condemnable. Lima displayed an impressive level of composure despite being the victim of such an act. He calmly informed the referee about the bite, initiating a brief investigation into the matter.

Severino will now have to rebuild his reputation by competing in smaller promotions before he can even consider a return to the UFC, Professional Fighters League, or any other reputable mixed martial arts organization. It will require time and effort for him to regain the trust of fans and officials.

As Saturday's events in Las Vegas come to a close, stay tuned for more traditional fight results. UFC Fight Night: Ribas vs. Namajunas has undoubtedly provided fans with an eventful and memorable night, though not necessarily for the right reasons.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff92c285143669667fa59c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3188,1794,x0,y217,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-23 22:45:24,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.forbes.com/sites/anuradhavaranasi/2024/03/24/which-adhd-medications-could-lower-risk-of-suicide--hospitalization/,Which ADHD Medications Could Lower Risk Of Suicide & Hospitalization?,"Illustration of the ADHD process, attention deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity. The cerebral areas located in the frontal lobe, responsible for attention, organizational skills, and emotional responses are abnormally active or have a specific anatomy. There is also an imbalance in levels of some chemical messengers (neurotransmitters) in the brain, such as dopamine and noradrenaline.

A recent study involving 221,714 individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) revealed that those prescribed ADHD stimulant medications had a lower risk of suicide attempts and psychiatric hospitalizations. Heidi Taipale and her team from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden found that medications like amphetamine, lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate were associated with decreased hospitalizations due to psychiatric co-morbidities.

Specifically, lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate were linked to a reduced risk of suicidal behavior. In a separate study in Sweden in 2019, it was reported that individuals with ADHD had a higher prevalence of psychiatric co-morbidities compared to those without ADHD. These co-morbidities included major depressive disorder, panic disorder, substance abuse, and other mental health conditions.

The study also noted that psychiatric co-morbidity increased the mortality risk among individuals with ADHD, especially when substance use disorder was present. While atomoxetine did not show a lower risk of psychiatric hospitalizations or suicidal behavior, it was associated with fewer hospitalizations for non-psychiatric co-morbidities.

The researchers emphasized the importance of ADHD medications in improving functioning and quality of life, despite potential long-term safety concerns. The study included individuals aged 16 to 65 in Sweden diagnosed with ADHD between 2006 and 2021. Data from the Swedish National Patient Register and Prescribed Drug Register were analyzed to track medication use and healthcare outcomes.

Methylphenidate was the most commonly used ADHD medication, followed by lisdexamphetamine and atomoxetine. The study participants were monitored for 15 years, with over half experiencing psychiatric co-morbidities. Anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and stress-related disorders were among the most common co-morbidities.

Interestingly, lisdexamphetamine showed a decreased risk of psychiatric hospitalizations across different age groups, while methylphenidate appeared less effective in older adults. Atomoxetine was linked to a reduced risk of hospitalization in women but not men. Overall, the study found positive effects on psychiatric outcomes with ADHD medications.

The researchers highlighted concerns about the potential adverse effects of long-term stimulant use, such as increased blood pressure, heart rate, and the risk of cardiovascular diseases. The study, published in JAMA Network Open on March 20, 2024, underscores the importance of monitoring and evaluating the benefits and risks of ADHD medications in clinical practice.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/63c28dbb82c31b7412c92cf2/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 04:09:46,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/23/explained-the-difference-between-a-solar-eclipse-and-a-lunar-eclipse/,Explained: The Difference Between A Solar Eclipse And A Lunar Eclipse,"Do you know the difference between a solar eclipse and a lunar eclipse? In the next few weeks, we will witness two extraordinary celestial events—a lunar eclipse on Monday, March 25, and a solar eclipse on Monday, April 8. While these phenomena are distinct from each other, they share a common cause: the alignment of celestial bodies.

Let's start with the lunar eclipse. This phenomenon occurs when Earth's shadow is projected onto the moon. During a lunar eclipse, the moon is positioned behind Earth, and the sun's light is blocked, casting a shadow on our lunar neighbor. However, lunar eclipses are relatively rare due to the subtle differences in the orbital planes of the Earth and the moon around the sun.

On the other hand, a solar eclipse occurs when the moon blocks the sun's light and creates a shadow on Earth. This can only happen during a new moon, when the moon is positioned between the sun and Earth. While new moons occur every 29 days, it is uncommon for the moon to align perfectly with the sun from our perspective on Earth, resulting in a solar eclipse.

So, what causes these awe-inspiring events? Let's delve deeper into the mechanisms behind them.

A total lunar eclipse occurs when the sun, Earth, and moon align perfectly. Earth has two distinct shadows—the fuzzy outer penumbral shadow and the dark central umbral shadow. When a full moon drifts into Earth's umbral shadow, it is deprived of direct sunlight. The only light that reaches its surface is sunlight refracted by Earth's atmosphere. As a result, the moon takes on a pinkish-red hue, resembling a thousand sunsets. If you were standing on the moon during a lunar eclipse, you would be immersed in this ethereal pinkish-red light, witnessing a partial or total solar eclipse.

On March 25, we will experience a penumbral lunar eclipse, as the full ""Worm Moon"" passes through Earth's penumbra—the lighter, outer part of the shadow.

Now, let's explore the phenomenon of a total solar eclipse. This occurs when the sun, moon, and Earth align perfectly, creating a celestial marvel. Similar to a new moon, the moon casts two shadows—a fuzzy outer penumbral shadow and a dark central umbral shadow. However, during a total solar eclipse, the moon's umbral shadow is projected onto Earth as it completely obscures the sun. This peculiar occurrence is possible because the moon is approximately 400 times smaller than the sun but also 400 times closer to Earth.

As the moon orbits from west to east, it casts its shadow across Earth's surface. This motion matches the direction of Earth's rotation, resulting in a slower movement of the moon's shadow. This shadow, known as the path of totality, allows observers within its range to witness a breathtaking phenomenon—a total solar eclipse. If you were on the moon during a total solar eclipse, you would witness the moon's shadow traversing Earth.

On April 8, we will be treated to a total solar eclipse, as the new ""Pink Moon"" perfectly blocks the sun and projects its umbral shadow over North America.

You may wonder why lunar and solar eclipses are relatively rare. The answer lies in the moon's tilted orbit around Earth. The moon's path through the sky intersects the sun's path twice during each orbit, which occurs monthly. However, for a solar or lunar eclipse to transpire, the moon must be in its new or full phase. This particular scenario occurs twice a year, resulting in two ""eclipse seasons"" with a higher likelihood of solar and lunar eclipses. Nevertheless, most solar eclipses are either partial or annular (forming a ""ring of fire""), while lunar eclipses are often penumbral or partial.

Looking ahead, let's explore the upcoming lunar and solar eclipses in 2024 and 2025.

In 2024, there will be two ""eclipse seasons."" The first will commence on March 25, featuring a penumbral lunar eclipse visible in North America. This will be followed by a total solar eclipse on April 8, also visible in North America. The second eclipse season will occur on September 17, with a partial lunar eclipse visible in North America. On October 2, an annular solar eclipse will be visible in the Pacific Ocean and South America.

In 2025, we will witness two more eclipse seasons. The first will begin on March 13, presenting a total lunar eclipse visible in North America. On March 29, a partial solar eclipse will be visible in Canada and northern Europe. The second eclipse season will commence on September 7, showcasing a total lunar eclipse visible in Asia. On September 21, a partial solar eclipse will be visible in Antarctica.

As we eagerly anticipate these extraordinary celestial events, remember to keep an eye on the latest updates regarding the total solar eclipse on April 8 in North America.
