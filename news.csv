https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/26/ember-is-building-an-all-electric-intercity-bus-network-in-the-uk/,How Ember is building an all-electric intercity bus network in the UK,"A Scottish company has successfully raised $14 million in funding to expand its all-electric intercity bus network across the UK. Ember, founded in 2019 by Keith Bradbury and Pierce Glennie, started with just one bus procured from a manufacturer willing to take them seriously. They faced skepticism from companies when they approached them to purchase a single electric coach. However, China's Yutong and its UK distributor Pelican were willing to do business and sold Ember its first bus. Since then, Ember has expanded its routes to include cities like Glasgow, Stirling, and Perth.

Ember currently operates with 24 buses, but they have recently received 14 next-generation vehicles from Yutong that have an improved battery capable of powering 510km on a single charge. This is a significant improvement from the previous generation's range of 380km. Bradbury mentioned that Ember had been closely involved in the design and development of the new vehicles, providing input on the battery layout and vehicle architecture.

In terms of funding, Ember has raised over $2.3 million in seed funding from European climate tech investors. Their Series A funding round was led by Inven Capital, 2150, and AENU, with participation from existing backers. With this new funding, Ember plans to expand its operations across Scotland and the rest of the UK.

Ember takes a ""full-stack"" approach to its fleet development, meaning they have control over various aspects of their operations, including manufacturing, charging infrastructure, customer service, and software development. The company uses lithium-iron-phosphate batteries, which are cobalt-free and more environmentally friendly. The latest version of their bus has faster charging capabilities, with the ability to be fully charged in less than an hour. The buses also have increased passenger capacity, with room for 53 passengers compared to the previous 38.

Ember currently has a charging hub in Dundee with 1,200 kW of charging capacity, supported by on-site wind turbines. However, with the addition of new buses and plans for further expansion, Ember aims to add an additional 4 megawatts of charging capacity across other sites in Scotland this year. They use a CCS EV charging system, which supports both AC and DC charging, making it compatible with other electric vehicles in Europe.

Ember's proprietary software, EmberOS, automates many aspects of their operations, including vehicle monitoring, maintenance, and charging. They are also focused on providing a seamless and comfortable experience for passengers, with features like 5G Wi-Fi and USB charging ports inside the buses.

Ember's ambitious plans to build an all-electric intercity bus network in the UK have gained momentum with their recent funding success. With their expanded fleet, faster charging capabilities, and commitment to sustainability, Ember is well-positioned to make a significant impact in the transportation sector. As they continue to grow, Ember aims to play a role in addressing the charging infrastructure challenges faced by the UK and potentially share access with third-party users in the future.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Ember-Keith-and-Pierce-e1711126322528.jpeg?resize=1200,676",2024-03-26 07:00:11,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/carriemccabe/2024/03/26/is-esg-the-toxic-wordle-in-asset-management/,Is ESG The Toxic Wordle In Asset Management?,"In a recent article titled ""It's not just 'woke.' These are the most polarizing words in America,"" the CEO of the Harris Poll and vice chair of Stagwell discuss how certain words have become divisive in the business world. The top two words on this list are ""DEI"" and ""ESG."" They even coined the term ""toxic wordle"" to describe these damaging business words and phrases.

Despite the cleverness of the toxic wordle phrase, there seems to be a softening of stances around DEI and ESG in asset management since the Supreme Court's affirmative action ruling in June '23. However, there is still great confusion about what these terms actually mean. To provide some clarity, let's explore four examples from Morningstar, ASC Advisors, Goldman Sachs, and Quality Shareholders Group.

Morningstar recently reported that sustainable investing had a rough year in 2023. Poor investment performance and political scrutiny led to over $13 billion being pulled from sustainable funds, with equity funds being hit the hardest. Demand for sustainable investing remains weak this year.

ASC Advisors conducted a report titled ""ESG & The Top 50 Hedge Funds 2024."" They analyzed the websites and form ADVs of the top 50 hedge funds in 2023 and found some interesting trends. While 44 percent of these funds are signatories to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), this number has slightly decreased from 52 percent in 2022.

Goldman Sachs released a survey called ""Staying the Course in Private Markets"" that focused on sustainable investing in private markets. They surveyed over 200 limited partners and general partners and found that sustainability is a focus but more work needs to be done. The adoption of sustainable investing is highest in the EMEA region and lowest in the Americas, where 24 percent of LPs reported it was not a focus.

Lawrence Cunningham, founder of Quality Shareholders Group, discusses the politicization of ESG proposals. He notes that support for progressive social proposals has significantly decreased after reaching record levels in 2022 and 2023. Shareholders may be expressing their dissatisfaction with the politicization of business. On the other hand, there has been a rise in conservative proposals, but they have also gained little support.

One of the challenges that businesses face, especially in politically charged times, is the need to clearly communicate their intentions. Loose use of acronyms and labels only adds to the confusion surrounding ESG and sustainability. Businesses should be specific about what they mean when they mention these terms. Unlike the industry's ambiguity, the four examples mentioned in this article provide clear concepts and facts about ESG and sustainability.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660238a100b26c8097e589d7/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-26 02:41:59,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/uzbekistan-unicorn-uzum-series-a-funding/,Meet Uzbekistan's first unicorn: e-commerce startup Uzum,"Uzum, an e-commerce startup in Uzbekistan, has recently raised $114 million in funding, making it the country's first unicorn with a valuation of $1.16 billion. Uzbekistan is a promising market for startups, with a young population and high levels of literacy and internet and smartphone penetration. However, the e-commerce sector in the country is still underdeveloped, accounting for only 2.2% of the total retail market. Uzum aims to fill this gap by offering a comprehensive online marketplace with end-to-end logistics and delivery.

Before Uzum, Uzbeks primarily shopped online through social media apps like Instagram, TikTok, and Telegram, connecting with sellers in groups. However, these platforms had limited stock and no proper logistics. Uzum recognized the opportunity to create a cohesive marketplace that could provide a wide range of products and efficient delivery services. The company launched its marketplace in October 2022 and now has over 8 million monthly active users and more than 9,000 merchants selling over 600,000 products.

In addition to its e-commerce platform, Uzum has expanded into fintech, offering a buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) product. Approximately 45% to 50% of e-commerce transactions on Uzum are done through the BNPL solution. The company has also entered the food delivery business and established a digital bank. By attracting customers through e-commerce, Uzum can retain them on high-transaction businesses like banking and monetize them through lending and credit products.

The recent funding round, led by FinSight Ventures, raised $114 million, with $52 million in equity and $62 million in debt. Uzum plans to use two-thirds of the funding for its fintech business and one-third for its e-commerce arm. The company also plans to raise $200 million in a Series B round this year from investors in the Middle East, U.K., and the U.S. The funds will be used to expand its product offerings, enhance its infrastructure, and invest in IT and logistics.

Uzum has ambitious plans for growth. It aims to increase its gross merchandise value (GMV) by 150% to 200%, grow its credit portfolio, and increase the total payment volume circulated through its ecosystem. By the end of the year, Uzum plans to combine all its businesses into two super appsâ€”one for consumers and another for businesses. It also plans to launch the country's largest e-commerce logistics complex in June.

While there are a few companies globally that operate similarly to Uzum, such as Nubank in Latin America and Kaspi.kz in Kazakhstan, Uzum believes it has a unique advantage in Uzbekistan. By combining its e-commerce and fintech services, Uzum can enjoy different margins across products and make higher profits. The company aims to become a national tech leader in Uzbekistan and replicate the success of Kaspi.kz in neighboring Kazakhstan.

With its recent funding and plans for expansion, Uzum is well-positioned to transform the e-commerce and fintech landscape in Uzbekistan. Its comprehensive marketplace and innovative financial products have already gained significant traction, and with the support of investors, Uzum is set to become a major player in the country's tech industry.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/uzum-logistics.jpg?w=1200,2024-03-26 05:00:18,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/timtreadgold/2024/03/25/us-and-australia-get-cosy-over-critical-metals/,U.S. And Australia Get Cosy Over Critical Metals,"The global pursuit of critical metals for advanced technologies and renewable energy is bringing the United States and Australia closer together, while also highlighting a growing divide with China. Recent developments in the lithium and rare earths markets illustrate these dynamics.

Pilbara Minerals, a leading Australian lithium miner, has expressed interest in strengthening ties with the U.S. and taking advantage of the incentives offered by the American government. Despite its partnership with a Chinese company in an expansion project, Pilbara is exploring opportunities to build a lithium conversion plant outside of China. The goal is to tap into new battery material markets and capitalize on the subsidies provided by the U.S.

The Australian Financial Review succinctly captured Pilbara's strategy with the headline, ""Pilbara Minerals mulls building a lithium processing plant anywhere but China."" While the details of a joint venture with a Chinese partner while accessing U.S. incentives are still unclear, Pilbara's management is optimistic about the potential success of this approach.

Meanwhile, another significant deal between Australia and the U.S. involves the monetization of a unique geological structure abundant in rare earths and other critical minerals. The U.S. government's trade finance arm, the Export-Import Bank (EXIM), has extended a $600 million letter-of-interest to Australian Strategic Minerals (ASM) to support the final design and development of the Dubbo project in New South Wales.

In addition to the EXIM announcement, ASM has also awarded a contract to Bechtel, one of the largest engineering and construction firms in the U.S., for ore processing and infrastructure technical services. This collaboration, which combines government financing with the expertise of a major engineering company, solidifies U.S. involvement in the Dubbo project. After three decades of evaluation, the project aims to generate profits from a complex orebody.

Ailie MacAdam, President of Bechtel Mining and Metals, describes the Dubbo project as having global strategic importance in the rare earths and critical minerals sector. The array of minerals found at Dubbo includes high-value rare earths such as neodymium and praseodymium, as well as tantalum, niobium, hafnium, and zirconium. The challenge for ASM lies in separating these metals and producing the materials in demand by customers at a competitive price.

The Australia-U.S. Taskforce on Critical Minerals has prioritized the Dubbo project as part of its efforts to leverage Australia's geological resources for the benefit of U.S. industries. Rowena Smith, CEO of ASM, believes that the project is well-positioned to align with the joint objectives of Australia and the U.S.

In summary, the pursuit of critical metals for innovative technologies and renewable energy is forging closer ties between the U.S. and Australia. The desire to reduce reliance on China and capitalize on economic incentives has led to partnerships and collaborations in the lithium and rare earths sectors. With the U.S. government's support and the involvement of engineering and construction firms, both countries are working towards unlocking the potential of these critical minerals.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660204347dcbbcbc0ad19587/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 21:27:14,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/christianmiller/2024/03/25/getting-more-impatient-when-the-end-is-in-sight-taylor-swifts-new-album-covid-vaccines-and-the-2020-presidential-election/,Getting More Impatient When the End Is in Sight,"Are you eagerly awaiting Taylor Swift's highly anticipated new album, The Tortured Poets Department? As the release date approaches, you may find yourself experiencing a mix of emotions. Will your impatience increase, stay the same, or decrease? While all three options seem plausible, a recent study conducted by Annabelle Roberts at the University of Texas and Ayelet Fishbach at the University of Chicago reveals an interesting finding.

Contrary to what one might expect, the level of impatience isn't solely determined by the time and energy invested in waiting. Instead, it is often driven by the desire for closure in a particular area of our lives. Roberts and Fishbach's study focused on the COVID-19 pandemic and the release of vaccines in the United States in early 2021. They surveyed 161 participants at three different times, asking about their impatience levels to get a coronavirus vaccine and for the pandemic to end.

The results showed that participants' impatience for the vaccine increased over time, reaching its peak as the vaccine's availability drew closer. However, their impatience for the pandemic to end remained relatively stable. This suggests that the trajectory of impatience was influenced by the proximity to the end of the wait rather than the duration of the wait itself.

Another study conducted by Roberts and Fishbach examined the impatience surrounding the 2020 U.S. presidential race between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. They surveyed 215 participants in the days leading up to the election, including an extra day due to delayed election results. The findings revealed that impatience levels rose as Election Day approached, indicating a shared desire for closure among both Biden and Trump supporters.

The researchers also explored impatience in everyday scenarios, such as waiting for a bus or a package. Interestingly, impatience increased as the remaining time decreased. It wasn't the total time spent waiting that influenced impatience but rather the time left until the desired event or outcome. Similar results were observed in imaginary scenarios involving tracking the distance of a delivery truck or experiencing a traffic delay.

The implications of this research are noteworthy. Roberts and Fishbach suggest that those in charge of a situation, such as government officials or customer service representatives, should inform people about delays earlier and potentially overestimate the wait time to manage expectations. Additionally, it may be beneficial to plan activities or distractions in advance when anticipating a long-awaited event to help alleviate impatience.

So, for all the Swifties eagerly counting down the days until the album release (April 19th!), brace yourselves for an increasing surge of impatience. But fear not, for closure will soon be upon us, and Taylor Swift's new album will finally be in our hands.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65f253e5f8f81a9d16371132/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1350,759,x0,y0,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 20:53:11,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/timothypapandreou/2024/03/25/generative-ai-healthcare-from-treatment-to-global-wellness/,Generative AI Healthcare: From Treatment To Global Wellness,"We are on the brink of a revolutionary change in the healthcare industry. The current healthcare systems are outdated, expensive, and inefficient. However, there is hope in the form of generative AI, a powerful technology that has the ability to analyze vast amounts of data, identify patterns, and create innovative solutions. In the field of healthcare, generative AI is set to transform our approach to health, work, and healing. It is not here to replace doctors, but rather to assist them in providing better care, focusing on prevention, and personalizing treatment.

One of the most exciting applications of generative AI is its use as a medical discovery tool. It is evolving rapidly and has the potential to accelerate the simulation of drug compounds, tailor treatment plans based on individual genetic makeup, and even design custom bio-printed prosthetics. Imagine a world where instead of annual check-ups, your cells are constantly monitored for any signs of disease, allowing for early intervention and avoiding costly treatments and surgeries. This may sound like something out of science fiction, but companies like Google's MedLM and NVIDIA are already using AI to analyze global datasets and predict diseases before they occur.

The business case for generative AI in healthcare is also incredibly strong. The health and wellness industry is a trillion-dollar economy, but the systems in place are outdated and inefficient. Introducing generative AI can benefit not only patient care but also reduce the administrative burden on healthcare professionals. This would free up their time for more meaningful patient interactions and personalized care. Additionally, it would enable a shift from reactive treatment to proactive health management, focusing on prevention and early detection. The potential applications of generative AI in healthcare are vast and varied.

Let's take a look at some specific examples of how generative AI is already being used in healthcare. Wellness apps like Calm use AI to personalize content and track user progress in sleep meditation and mindfulness exercises. Chatbots and virtual assistants like those offered by EMed and Ada Health help patients by providing symptom checking, triage, and connecting them with appropriate healthcare services. Woebot Health offers an AI chatbot for cognitive behavioral therapy to support individuals experiencing depression and anxiety. In the field of pathology, companies like Paige are utilizing generative AI to assist pathologists in cancer diagnosis through pathology slide analysis. In drug discovery, companies like BenevolentAI and Atomwise are using AI to analyze scientific and patient datasets to discover and develop new drugs. Robotic-assisted surgery is also benefiting from generative AI, with companies like Intuitive Surgical and Auris Health developing systems for complex procedures, including lung cancer surgery. And in the realm of 3D printing, Stratasys is using generative AI to create custom prosthetics, surgical models, and bioprinting.

The possibilities are endless when it comes to generative AI in healthcare. From personalized treatment plans to early disease detection, this technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach our health. It is time to embrace innovation, efficiency, affordability, and customer service in the healthcare industry. With generative AI as our ally, we can usher in an era of global wellness, where prevention and personalized care take center stage. So let's embrace this paradigm shift and work towards a future that prioritizes our well-being.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6602332557114bec935353fe/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 22:42:30,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-large-language-simple-mechanism-knowledge.html,Large language models use a surprisingly simple mechanism to retrieve some stored knowledge,"Large language models (LLMs) are complex systems that power AI chatbots like ChatGPT. Despite their widespread use, scientists still have limited understanding of how these models work. To gain insight into their inner workings, researchers from MIT and other institutions conducted a study on how LLMs retrieve stored knowledge.

Surprisingly, the researchers discovered that LLMs often use a simple linear function to decode and recover stored facts. These linear functions, which involve two variables and no exponents, capture the straightforward relationship between variables. Furthermore, the model employs the same decoding function for similar types of facts.

By identifying linear functions for different facts, the researchers were able to probe the model and determine where and what it knows about new subjects. They also found that even when a model answers a prompt incorrectly, it often retains the correct information. This approach could potentially help identify and correct falsehoods within the model, reducing the occurrence of incorrect or nonsensical answers.

According to Evan Hernandez, an electrical engineering and computer science graduate student at MIT, ""even though these models are really complicated, nonlinear functions that are trained on lots of data and are very hard to understand, there are sometimes really simple mechanisms working inside them.""

Hernandez and his co-lead author, Arnab Sharma, developed a technique to estimate these simple linear functions. They applied this method to compute functions for 47 different relations, such as ""capital city of a country"" and ""lead singer of a band."" While there are countless possible relations, the researchers focused on this specific subset as it represents the types of facts that can be expressed in this manner.

The researchers conducted experiments to probe LLMs and found that despite their complexity, the models rely on linear functions to decode relational information. Each decoding function is specific to the type of fact being retrieved. For example, one function is used to output the instrument a person plays, while another is used to output the state where a person was born.

The research sheds light on the mechanisms behind LLMs' ability to retrieve and decode stored facts. It provides valuable insights into the inner workings of these complex models and opens up possibilities for future improvements, including the identification and correction of falsehoods within the models.

The findings of this study will be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024) in May. The research offers a glimpse into the fascinating world of large language models and their potential for advancing AI technology.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/large-language-models-2.jpg,2024-03-25 09:34:06,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/fisker-trading-suspended-by-nyse/,Fisker trading suspended by NYSE,"The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) made an announcement on Monday that it will suspend trading shares of electric vehicle (EV) startup Fisker and is taking steps to remove the company from its stock exchange. The NYSE stated that Fisker's stock is no longer suitable for listing due to abnormally low price levels. This decision follows a warning from the NYSE last month that Fisker's stock price had been trading below $1 for 30 consecutive days, which is not in compliance with the exchange's rules.

Fisker has the opportunity to review the NYSE's determination, but in a filing made on Monday afternoon, the company stated that it expects its stock to be moved to an over-the-counter market such as OTC Pink. Additionally, the delisting has triggered repayment clauses in two outstanding loans that Fisker is currently unable to afford, which could have a significant negative impact on the business.

This suspension of trading marks the end of a tumultuous day for Fisker, as its shares fell more than 28% before trading was halted. Earlier in the day, Fisker announced the loss of a potential deal with a major automaker, rumored to be Nissan. This development has also put in jeopardy a recently announced attempt to secure emergency funding.

Fisker did not provide an explanation for why the automaker terminated the negotiations, which was a critical condition for closing a potential $150 million convertible note that was announced last week. In the filing, Fisker stated that it will request the unnamed investor to waive the closing condition.

Fisker has been facing a series of problems for several months, including customer complaints, lawsuits, and federal investigations. The troubled EV startup has struggled to sell its Ocean SUV, falling short of its own sales goals. In January, TechCrunch reported that Fisker had shifted from a direct sales model to utilizing dealerships to boost sales. The company has also grappled with quality issues that it has had difficulty resolving, according to internal documents.

In February, Fisker laid off around 200 employees, which accounted for 15% of its workforce. Last week, the company reported having only $121 million in cash reserves and announced a production pause. Fisker has warned investors that it will not survive another year without a fresh injection of funds.

It is important to note that the information provided in this article has been updated to include details from Fisker's SEC filing on Monday afternoon.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fisker-GettyImages.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-25 21:06:18,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/maju-kuruvilla-is-out-as-ceo-of-one-click-checkout-company-bolt/,Maju Kuruvilla is out as CEO of one-click checkout company Bolt,"Bolt, the one-click checkout company, has announced a change in leadership. Maju Kuruvilla, the former CEO, has been replaced by Justin Grooms, who previously served as Bolt's global head of sales. Grooms will now take on the role of interim CEO, according to his LinkedIn profile.

Kuruvilla confirmed the change on both LinkedIn and X, simply stating, ""One-Click Checkedout from @bolt! Onwards,"" accompanied by a rocket emoji. Although he did not provide further comments, Arjun Sethi, a co-founder of venture firm Tribe Capital, expressed admiration for Kuruvilla in a comment on his LinkedIn post.

The decision to remove Kuruvilla from his position was made by the Bolt board over the weekend, as reported by The Information. Kuruvilla, a former executive at Amazon, took over as CEO in January 2022 after founder Ryan Breslow stepped down.

Grooms, who has been with Bolt for five years, previously held executive positions at companies such as Ultraleap (formerly Leap Motion), Datron World Communications, and Qualcomm, as stated on his LinkedIn profile. Bolt informed The Information that the CEO role had changed and described Kuruvilla's departure as ""amicable,"" without providing further details.

Bolt has had its fair share of controversies. The company was founded by Breslow, then 27 years old, after dropping out of Stanford. Breslow was known for his outspoken rants. In an interview with TechCrunch, Breslow mentioned that Bolt had signed significant deals in the second half of 2021, surpassing any previous deals in the company's history.

However, Bolt faced challenges, including a federal probe involving Breslow's potential violation of securities laws during the company's fundraising efforts in 2021. Bolt was seeking a $355 million Series E round that valued the company at $11 billion. In total, the company raised approximately $1 billion in venture-backed funding.

Bolt also experienced several rounds of layoffs, including one in May 2022, where about 185 employees, or one-third of the workforce, were let go. Additional layoffs occurred in early 2023 and December 2023, affecting 29% of the staff.

In October, when Kuruvilla was still CEO, he informed TechCrunch that the SEC was no longer investigating Bolt. He also mentioned that the company was working towards profitability and had plans to introduce new features, such as improving merchandise returns and providing personalized experiences for its universal shopper network. Bolt announced partnerships with retailers like Saks OFF 5TH, Shinola, Filson, Lafayette 148, and Toys ""R"" Us in November.

Recently, Bolt signed an exclusive deal with Checkout.com, becoming Checkout.com's preferred payment partner and providing one-click checkout services.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/elon-musk-x-ccdh-california-lawsuit-dismissed/,A judge just killed Elon Musk's lawsuit against an anti-hate research org,"Federal Judge Dismisses Lawsuit by Elon Musk and X Against Nonprofit Researching Online Hate

In a recent development, a federal judge has ruled against Elon Musk and X, dismissing their lawsuit against the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH). The lawsuit, filed last year, accused the nonprofit organization of spreading misleading claims through a series of reports on hate and extremism on the platform. Musk and X claimed that they suffered significant financial losses as a result of the CCDH's research.

Additionally, Musk and X alleged that the CCDH engaged in illegal data scraping and violated the platform's rules by aggregating content using a third-party social media monitoring tool called Brandwatch. Musk, who played a personal role in directing the lawsuit, went as far as calling the CCDH ""an evil propaganda machine"" in his replies on X.

Last year, the CCDH filed a motion to strike X's claims under California's law against Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (SLAPP), which aims to prevent baseless lawsuits intended to intimidate. The CCDH also requested the judge to dismiss the lawsuit. Imran Ahmed, CEO of the CCDH, accused Musk of intentionally prolonging the legal process to drive up the organization's legal costs, highlighting Musk's considerable net worth of around $200 billion.

On Monday, United States District Judge Charles R. Breyer granted the CCDH's motion to dismiss the case. Judge Breyer also denied Musk and X the opportunity to reopen the case for further litigation.

In his ruling, Judge Breyer stated, ""Sometimes it is unclear what is driving a litigation, and only by reading between the lines of a complaint can one attempt to surmise a plaintiff's true purpose. Other times, a complaint is so unabashedly and vociferously about one thing that there can be no mistaking that purpose."" He further expressed that X Corp.'s intention was to punish the CCDH for its critical publications about X Corp. and potentially discourage others from engaging in such criticism.

Following Musk's increased activity on Twitter, the CCDH drew attention to the rise of hate speech on the platform. One report explored how Musk's decision to unban several highly followed extremists could potentially boost the company's ad revenue. Notably, the report highlighted the inclusion of Andrew Anglin, an infamous neo-Nazi who created the white supremacist website, the Daily Stormer.

The CCDH, established in 2018, focuses on researching trends in hate speech, extremism, and misinformation on major social networks. Its research regularly exposes disturbing content across various platforms, such as reports on eating disorder content on TikTok, climate denial on YouTube, and violent misogynistic threats on Instagram.

In response to the ruling, CCDH CEO Imran Ahmed said, ""We create costs for lies and hate."" He emphasized the importance of holding social media companies accountable for decisions that impact children, democracy, and fundamental human rights and civil liberties. The CCDH's legal team included Roberta Kaplan, who recently achieved a significant victory against former President Donald Trump in the E. Jean Carroll defamation suit. Kaplan commented on the ruling, stating, ""Today's decision proves that even the world's wealthiest man cannot bend the rule of law to his will.""

While the CCDH celebrates its victory in California, it is worth noting that Musk is pursuing a similar lawsuit against the left-leaning media watchdog Media Matters for America. However, unlike the CCDH case, X is suing Media Matters for America in Texas, which does not offer the same protections against frivolous lawsuits aimed at stifling free speech as California does.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/twitter-x-logo-musk-pattern.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-25 20:33:17,Innovation,Innovation
