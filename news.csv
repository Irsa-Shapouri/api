https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/24/new-whatsapp-warning-iphone-15-pro-max-samsung-s24-ultra-upgrade/,New WhatsApp Warning Suddenly Issued For 2 Billion Users,"WhatsApp is undergoing a major upgrade this year, with significant changes occurring in the global messaging landscape. From iMessage co-opting RCS to Google Messages incorporating Gemini AI and the DOJ lawsuit against Apple, these changes have brought attention to the end-to-end encryption used by messaging platforms like iMessage, WhatsApp, and Signal. Even Google Messages and Facebook Messenger have made it the default option. 

End-to-end encryption is crucial for maintaining the security and privacy of messages. It ensures that only the sender and recipient can access the content, protecting it from any third-party interference, including the platform owners themselves. The adoption of full encryption has led WhatsApp to warn users that third-party chats may not be as secure as WhatsApp-to-WhatsApp chats. Similarly, the DOJ has criticized Apple for not providing full iMessage security on Android, making iPhone users less secure. Despite pressure from governments and security agencies, Facebook Messenger has also embraced end-to-end encryption by default. 

It is surprising, then, to see media reports encouraging users to transfer their chats from WhatsApp to Telegram. WhatsApp allows users to export their chat history, including videos and documents, and transfer it to Telegram. However, this move raises serious security concerns. Unlike WhatsApp, which has end-to-end encryption as the default setting, Telegram does not provide the same level of security. Its ""secret chat"" option must be manually selected for each one-on-one conversation. Last year, cybersecurity company Kaspersky warned that Telegram's claims of security were not entirely accurate. The default chat option in Telegram does not use end-to-end encryption, and users are not adequately informed about the secure chat option. Moving chats from a secure platform like WhatsApp to Telegram, which lacks default end-to-end encryption, is a significant security risk, especially for group chats containing sensitive information from multiple users. 

WhatsApp's export chat function / iOS
When Telegram first introduced the option to migrate WhatsApp chats, I cautioned against it as a dangerous misstep for users. This advice still holds true, despite the backlash against WhatsApp following Meta's (formerly Facebook) proposed changes to user terms and conditions, which were eventually abandoned. Pulling content out of end-to-end encrypted messaging platforms removes the protective barriers designed to safeguard messages. While accessibility is crucial in today's online world, it should not come at the cost of security and privacy. Telegram's cross-platform usability is advertised as a key feature, but this is possible because the content is stored on Telegram's central servers, which compromises end-to-end encryption. Furthermore, Telegram promotes its cloud storage capabilities as a way to reduce smartphone storage, but this convenience comes at the expense of full encryption. The security of your data is dependent on policy rather than technology. 

In light of these concerns, I strongly advise against following any advice to switch from WhatsApp to Telegram. Despite marketing claims, this move is a step backward in terms of security. Moreover, there are other issues related to Telegram that users need to be aware of. Telegram plays two opposing roles in the messaging world. On one hand, it positions itself as an easy-to-use alternative to WhatsApp with a range of features, which is why it offers the option to migrate chats. On the other hand, Telegram has gained a reputation as a platform with limited content controls, leading to its suspension by Spain's High Court. Additionally, the Financial Times has likened Telegram to the dark web, and it has been described as ""social media for organized criminals."" While Telegram is used by a variety of individuals, including activists and campaigners, its association with criminal activities is concerning. 

In conclusion, it is essential to prioritize security and privacy when choosing a messaging platform. While Telegram may offer certain advantages, such as cross-platform usability and cloud storage, it falls short in terms of default end-to-end encryption. WhatsApp, on the other hand, provides full encryption as the default setting, ensuring that messages remain secure and private. Therefore, it is best to stick with WhatsApp and avoid the security risks associated with migrating to Telegram.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65b41420a2b346798e66d370/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2207,1442,x681,y315,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 23:45:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/24/meet-the-apps-that-tell-you-when-to-take-your-eclipse-glasses-off/,Meet The Apps That Tell You When To Take Your Eclipse Glasses Off,"When it comes to knowing when to remove your solar eclipse glasses, it can be a bit confusing. The process of experiencing a total solar eclipse involves several factors. First, you need to be within the path of totality, which is a narrow stretch that is only about 115 miles wide. Secondly, you must be in a location where the sky is clear. And finally, you need to remove your eclipse glasses at the right time to witness the sun's magnificent corona.

For many people, it's the last step that causes the most panic. So, let's simplify it. You remove your eclipse glasses when it starts to get dark. That's it. If you are in the path of totality, the darkness will descend rapidly as the moon's shadow passes over you. It's a moment that you won't miss. However, if you are not in the path of totality, it won't get dark, so you should continue to use your glasses.

But now, there are smartphone apps available that offer an immersive audio experience, providing instructions on when to remove your solar eclipse glasses as totality begins. These apps also guide you through other phenomena to watch for, such as shadow bands (wavy lines on the ground caused by Earth's turbulent atmosphere when the sun is a tiny crescent), Baily's beads (the last few drops of sunlight), and the diamond ring (the final bead as a jewel right before the corona appears like a halo).

Since these apps rely mainly on audio instructions and narration, it is recommended to use them with earphones. However, instead of using earbuds that block out the sounds around you, consider using over-the-ear bone conduction earphones for a more comfortable experience.

Let's take a look at some of the available apps:

1. The Eclipse Company App (Platforms: iOS and Android, Cost: Pro version costs extra)
The Pro version of The Eclipse Company's app offers real-time weather updates, cloud forecasts for totality, a countdown timer with a vibration alert to safely remove your solar eclipse glasses, and detailed information about local eclipse events. It also provides alerts for when to look for eclipse phenomena, creating an immersive audio experience. However, it does not provide any instructions during totality.

2. Solar Eclipse Timer App (Platforms: iOS and Android, Cost: $1.99 per eclipse)
The Solar Eclipse Timer app uses geolocation to confirm your position and determine if you are within the path of totality. It guides you through the contact times of the eclipse and also provides instructions for observing the various phenomena. This app is highly recommended for photographers, as it includes a ""Photographer's Mode"" developed in collaboration with ex-NASA eclipse calculator and photographer Fred Espenak, also known as ""Mr. Eclipse.""

3. One Eclipse (Platforms: iOS only, Cost: $1.99)
Developed by the non-profit organizations Astronomers Without Borders and Simulation Curriculum, One Eclipse supports a recycling program for eclipse glasses in underserved communities worldwide. In addition to simulating the eclipse from your location or anywhere on Earth, the app features an interactive map with precise eclipse event times and a dynamic Eclipse Countdown clock. It also includes a simple audio timer for all the different phases of the eclipse.

Remember to always check for the latest information on the total solar eclipse, including travel and lodging options.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/24/samsung-s24-ultra-s23-free-update-warning-for-galaxy-android-users/,Samsung Issues Critical Update For Millions Of Galaxy Users,"If you own a Samsung Galaxy device, it's essential to be aware of an important update that you should install as soon as it becomes available. Additionally, there is a significant change coming to your device that you won't want to miss.

Samsung continues to roll out its March security update, which initially covered premium devices and now includes more budget models. For example, carrier-unlocked S21 FE devices in the US recently became eligible for the update.

Over the past two weeks, the update has been released for various versions of S24s, S23s, and S22s, depending on the network, region, and model. It is crucial to ensure that your device downloads and installs this new software as soon as it is available for your specific network and model.

You can check whether your device will receive the monthly update by visiting Samsung's website.

Among the numerous fixes included in the update, there are two high-risk vulnerabilities that have been patched. These vulnerabilities could potentially allow malware to gain control of some or all of your device. Therefore, it is crucial to install the update to protect your device from potential security threats.

However, the availability of the March update is not the most significant news of the week. Samsung has finally adopted Google's seamless update system after years of avoiding it. Instead of the traditional download, install, and reboot cycle for updates, the new system downloads and installs updates in the background to a secondary partition on the device. The device then reboots from that partition during the next restart.

After the reboot, the secondary partition becomes the primary one, while the other partition awaits the next update. This process reduces the amount of time during which the device cannot be used normally, with most of it occurring in the background.

Google explains that A/B system updates, also known as seamless updates, ensure that a functioning booting system remains on the disk during an over-the-air update. This reduces the chances of the device becoming inactive after an update, resulting in fewer device replacements and re-flashes at repair and warranty centers.

To identify whether a seamless update is being installed on your device, you will see two progress bars—one for the download/install process and another for verification. While the Galaxy A55 has been the first device to receive Samsung's initial seamless update, it is expected to roll out to more devices in the coming months. We are eagerly waiting to see which devices will be next.

It remains to be seen whether this update approach will extend to all Samsung models. Samsung updates have been known for their complexity, requiring users to consult checklists to determine what, when, and for how long an update is available.

So why has Samsung finally decided to adopt this new approach? It's possible that the company was pushed to do so rather than making the decision voluntarily. A comment from the Android Open Source Project suggested that the legacy alternative to seamless updates would be removed after eight years of parallel operation.

Given that seamless updates became available in 2016, Samsung's resistance to adopting them has become quite legendary. On one hand, this has been a source of frustration for the Android project. On the other hand, Samsung is a vital player in the Android ecosystem, and discussions have likely taken place behind the scenes. However, we still don't know what the wider approach will be moving forward.

While this new update system may reduce the update process to just a minute or two during which the device is unusable, it won't simplify the Samsung/Android update combination that occurs every month across various devices. However, it will eliminate the need for user action. Google recommends scheduling updates when the device is idle, such as overnight and on Wi-Fi, to avoid disrupting users.

Although this new update system is still a far cry from Apple's streamlined approach, it brings Samsung and Android closer to achieving a similar level of simplicity. As iPhone and Android devices become increasingly similar, it is possible that they will continue to converge in the future.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65b9d23fb7b46f6467a28780/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2366,1280,x313,y135,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 22:00:00,Innovation,Innovation

North America is currently experiencing a golden age of eclipses, and this week marks a crucial moment leading up to a major event next week. In the early hours of Monday, March 25, the full worm moon will be partially eclipsed by Earth, creating a slight penumbral lunar eclipse. While it may not be a full ""blood moon"" total lunar eclipse, this celestial event is significant because it sets the stage for a total solar eclipse on Monday, April 8, 2024. If you're a fan of celestial wonders, you won't want to miss it! Read on for some planning tips to ensure you get the best view.

But that's not all there is to see in the night sky this week. As the week progresses, the waning gibbous moon will pass close to a couple of bright stars, making the early evening skies perfect for stargazing by the weekend. So, whether you're an avid stargazer or just someone who appreciates the beauty of the cosmos, here's everything you need to know about stargazing and astronomy this week.

Monday, March 25: 'Worm Moon Lunar Eclipse'

On Monday, March 25, the third full moon of 2024, also known as the ""Worm Moon,"" will pass through Earth's outer shadow in space, resulting in a slight penumbral lunar eclipse. This eclipse will be visible from the night side of Earth, including North and South America, Europe, East Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. If you happen to be in New York, the eclipse will begin at 00:53 a.m. EDT and end at 05:32 a.m. EDT, with the maximum eclipse occurring at 03:12 a.m. EDT. In Los Angeles, the eclipse will start at 9:53 p.m. PDT on Sunday, March 24, and end at 02:32 a.m. PDT on Monday, March 25, with the maximum eclipse at 00:12 a.m. EDT.

Tuesday, March 26: Moon And Spica

On Tuesday, March 26, a few hours after sunset, you'll have the opportunity to witness an unusual moonrise. Look towards the east and you'll see the almost full moon rising. But what makes this moonrise special is the presence of the bright star Spica, located just to the top right of the moon. Spica is the brightest star in the constellation Virgo and one of the 20 brightest stars in the night sky. It will be within 1.4 degrees of our natural satellite, creating a captivating celestial sight.

Saturday, March 30: Moon And Antares

If you find yourself awake late on Friday or in the early hours of Saturday, take a look towards the southeast. You'll be greeted by a 78%-lit waning gibbous moon, located less than a degree from Antares, a red supergiant star in the constellation Scorpius. This close proximity between the moon and Antares presents a beautiful celestial pairing that shouldn't be missed.

Galaxies Of The Week: Bode's And The Cigar

This week, the constellations Ursa Minor and Ursa Major, visible in the northern sky after dark, offer a treat for those with an 8-inch telescope. Ursa Major is home to two stunning galaxies that are worth observing. The first is M81, also known as Bode's galaxy. It is a large spiral galaxy located approximately 12 million light-years from Earth and is one of the brightest galaxies in the night sky. The second galaxy, M82, also known as the Cigar galaxy, is a starburst galaxy located about 12 million light-years away. It is known for its high rate of star formation and can be observed as small, diffuse patches of light northwest of the bright star Dubhe in the Big Dipper.

Eclipse Tip Of The Week: Preparing For The Total Solar Eclipse

Less than two weeks from now, North America will have the privilege of experiencing a total solar eclipse, one of the rarest and most beautiful celestial occurrences. If you haven't made plans yet, now is the time to act. Remember, to witness the full glory of a total solar eclipse, you must position yourself within the path of totality, which is indicated by the yellow stripe on the map above. Simply getting close to it won't provide the same breathtaking experience. For detailed information on where to stay and where to witness the eclipse, check out the plethora of articles available. Additionally, various websites offer maps, simulations, and event listings to help you plan your eclipse-viewing adventure.

To make the most of your stargazing experience, consult online planetariums like Stellarium and The Sky Live for accurate location-specific information. These resources provide details on planet-rise and planet-set times, as well as sunrise, sunset, moonrise, and moonset times for your specific location.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/techcrunch-mobility-the-wheels-are-starting-to-come-off-the-fisker-ev-bus/,TechCrunch Mobility: The wheels are starting to come off the Fisker EV bus,"TechCrunch Mobility is a weekly newsletter that provides news and insights on the future of transportation. In this edition, we will discuss the recent proposed standards by the Biden Administration, the latest investment by Uber in an Africa-founded startup, and other notable deals in the industry. So, let's dive in!

The Biden Administration has released two new proposed standards that will impact U.S. automakers and ultimately, consumers like you. The Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have put forth regulations that are stricter than before but have been softened to accommodate the automotive industry, car dealers, and unions.

The DOE's proposed standard is called the ""petroleum equivalency factor"" and assigns electric vehicles (EVs) a score under the government's corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. The original proposal would have made it challenging for automakers to meet the CAFE standards, resulting in billions of dollars in fines. However, the new proposal is more lenient.

On the other hand, the EPA has released tailpipe standards for 2027 to 2032 model year cars and light-duty trucks. These standards demand more from automakers but allow them to meet the rules using various powertrains. In other words, the standards are technology agnostic and do not require a complete shift to battery electric vehicles (EVs). This is a significant departure from the original proposal, which aimed for EVs to make up 67% of the total U.S. passenger vehicle market by 2032.

While these standards have minimal impact on EV startups like Rivian, Tesla, and Lucid, legacy automakers are facing challenges. They are investing billions in developing, building, and selling EVs while still making profits from internal combustion engine vehicles. In this scenario, plug-in hybrids might emerge as the winners.

In other news, Uber has made its first investment in an Africa-founded startup. Moove, an African mobility fintech company that offers vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers, raised $100 million in a Series B funding round led by Uber. This investment aligns with Uber's goal of achieving a fully zero-emission fleet by 2040.

Additionally, Amber, a Bay Area startup that recently launched an aftermarket Tesla extended warranty product, raised $3.18 million in a seed round. Candela, an electric boat maker, secured $25 million in funding led by Groupe Beneteau. These investments reflect the growing interest in sustainable and innovative transportation solutions.

Welcome back, Wordle enthusiasts! It's the last week of March, and time flies when you're having fun with puzzle games. Despite the odd weather this weekend, it's time to get back to work and back to Wordling!

Today's Wordle Hint and Clue

Before we dive into solving today's Wordle, let's take a look at the hint and clue to give us a head start. The hint suggests that we should think of today's phrase as a proper noun. As for the clue, it reveals that today's Wordle has a double letter. Interesting!

Solving Today's Wordle

Now, let's get to the exciting part—solving the Wordle! But before we do, fair warning: spoilers ahead!

I must admit, today's Wordle had me puzzled. The initial trade left me with a whopping 195 possible solutions, which was quite overwhelming. I made my first guess with ""Boink,"" hoping to narrow down the options. Unfortunately, it only reduced the possibilities to 40, leaving me floundering.

However, luck was on my side when I guessed ""Allay."" This word informed me that there was more than one 'L' and left me with just one word remaining. Almost tripped up by ""palsy,"" I realized I needed a second 'L.' After some brainstorming, I finally settled on ""sally,"" which I usually associate with a name. Surprisingly, it turns out that ""sally"" is also an antiquated term for a battle tactic.

Competitive Wordle Score

Once again, no points for guessing in four or tying the Bot. It's another big, fat zero. But hey, the fun is in the journey, right?

The Etymology of ""Sally""

Now, let's delve into the fascinating etymology of ""sally"" in the context of today's Wordle. In this context, ""sally"" means to suddenly rush forth or make a sudden attack from a defensive position. It can also refer to setting out on a journey or venture.

The word ""sally"" traces its origins through various languages before making its way into English. Its journey begins with the Middle French word ""sallie,"" which is the noun form of ""sallir,"" meaning ""to rush out, leap forth."" ""Sallir"" itself stems from the Latin word ""salire,"" which translates to ""to leap."" This Latin root has given rise to related English words like ""salient"" (prominently projecting) and ""assail"" (to attack). These words reflect the concept of movement or leaping forth.

In essence, the etymology of ""sally"" captures the action of moving out or leaping forth, often with an element of suddenness or unexpectedness. Whether it's a physical attack from a fortified position or embarking on a new journey, ""sally"" embodies the idea of taking bold and decisive action.
