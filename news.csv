https://www.zdnet.com/article/saving-hours-of-work-with-ai-how-chatgpt-became-my-virtual-assistant-for-a-data-project/,Saving hours of work with AI: How ChatGPT became my virtual assistant for a data project,"There has been a lot of buzz surrounding generative artificial intelligence (AI) lately. Tools like ChatGPT have garnered attention for their potential to assist in various projects. In this article, I will share a project where ChatGPT proved to be a valuable tool. While you may not have the same project requirements, I hope to inspire you to explore the possibilities of using ChatGPT for your own projects.

The project I undertook involved creating a ""stunt article"" that showcases the computer gear I could buy from Temu for under $100. I managed to stay within the budget, spending a total of $99.77. To compile this article, I needed to browse the Temu website to find items worth featuring. For example, I discovered an iPad keyboard and mouse that cost around $6. To ensure I stayed within the budget, I wanted to add all the Temu links to a spreadsheet, find the price for each item, and rearrange them until I reached the desired total.

However, the challenge was converting the Temu links into a usable format. This is where ChatGPT came to the rescue.

Phase 1: Gathering the links
To begin, I collected all the links by copying them from the Temu website and pasting them into a Notion page. Notion allows you to create bookmark blocks that not only contain links but also product names. Once I had selected all the blocks, I copied them and pasted the entire set into a text editor.

Phase 2: Identifying the data
Each block of data consisted of three key elements. The name of the product was enclosed in braces, the base URL was enclosed in parentheses, and there was a question mark separating the main URL from tracking data. I only needed the main URL, so I highlighted the relevant delimiters.

Phase 3: Teaching ChatGPT to recognize the data
To instruct ChatGPT, I provided the prompt: ""Accept the following data and await further instructions."" I then copied the information from the text editor and pasted it into ChatGPT. At this point, ChatGPT knew to wait for more details.

The next step was crucial. I wanted ChatGPT to extract the titles and links while disregarding the rest. I provided the prompt: ""The data above consists of a series of blocks of data..."" This prompt allowed me to name the data and test if ChatGPT understood the assignment. ChatGPT successfully completed the task but stopped when its buffer ran out. I instructed the bot to continue, and it retrieved the remaining data in less than a minute.

Phase 4: Cleaning up Temu's overly complex titles
Temu's product titles were overly complex for my project. Instead, I wanted simpler titles. For example, I transformed ""10 Inch LCD Writing Tablet, Electronis Memo With Leather Protective Case, Electronic Drawing Board For Digital Handwriting Pad Doodle Board, Gifts For"" into ""LCD writing tablet with case."" I assigned this task to ChatGPT and reminded it of the previous step to ensure a smooth continuation.

By utilizing ChatGPT, I was able to streamline the process, saving me hours of manual work. The tool effectively parsed the data and cleaned up the titles, providing me with the desired output. Whether you have a similar project or need assistance in other areas, ChatGPT can be a valuable tool to enhance your productivity. Its capabilities extend beyond simple text generation, making it a reliable workhorse for various projects.

Remember, generative AI tools like ChatGPT are powerful assistants, but they are still tools. They can help you achieve your goals, but they should be used alongside other productivity software. With the right prompts and guidance, ChatGPT can be a valuable asset in your toolkit.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/70d8814af33b190ff84b8faa5f9bafe13d3586e2/2024/03/25/7d1cb1ff-3bb7-4972-a6cd-33d04da76bc1/cover.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/25/total-eclipse-of-the-chatbot-why-not-to-ask-chatgpt-about-aprils-rare-event/,Total Eclipse Of The Chatbot: Why Not To Ask ChatGPT About Aprilâ€™s Rare Event,"When it comes to the timing of total solar eclipses, relying on AI chatbots may not be the best idea. Take ChatGPT, for example. This popular AI chatbot fails to provide accurate information about upcoming eclipses. I decided to put ChatGPT to the test by asking it when the next total solar eclipse would occur. Initially, it gave me a misleading response, stating that the next eclipse had already taken place on December 14, 2020, in South America. Clearly, this information was irrelevant and incorrect.

Undeterred, I asked ChatGPT again, and this time it got it right. The next total solar eclipse is set to occur on April 8, 2024, and will be visible from parts of North America, including Mexico, the United States, and Canada. Finally, some accurate information!

However, the odd replies did not stop there. When I asked about the next eclipse after April 8, 2024, ChatGPT provided an incorrect response, stating that it would take place on August 23, 2044. While there will indeed be an eclipse on that date in the contiguous United States, it is not the next one. In fact, the next total solar eclipse after April 8, 2024, will be on August 12, 2026, in Greenland, Iceland, and Spain. Surprisingly, between April 8, 2024, and August 23, 2044, there will be a staggering 13 total solar eclipses. It seems that ChatGPT may only be concerned with events occurring in the contiguous U.S.

To clarify further, I asked ChatGPT about the next eclipse after August 23, 2044. Unfortunately, it provided yet another incorrect answer, stating that it would happen on March 20, 2053. The truth is that the next total solar eclipse after August 23, 2044, will be on August 12, 2045, and it is arguably considered the ""Greatest American Eclipse"" of all. While there is an eclipse set for March 20, 2053, it is not a total solar eclipse.

It is clear that ChatGPT is inconsistent, biased toward events in the U.S., and frequently mistaken when it comes to solar eclipses. So, if you're an eclipse chaser, relying on AI chatbots like ChatGPT for accurate information is not recommended.

However, there is a glimmer of hope with Gemini, Google's new AI model engine formerly known as Bard. Gemini provides much more reliable information, consistently stating that the very next total solar eclipse will be on April 8, 2024, visible across parts of North America. It even goes the extra mile by informing me that I will be able to see it where I live. I tested Gemini multiple times, and it consistently provided the correct answers.

We must acknowledge that AI has its limitations, and celestial events calculated for thousands of years into the future may still be beyond its grasp. While ChatGPT may be effective for various tasks, it falls short when it comes to providing accurate information for eclipse enthusiasts.

For the most up-to-date information on total solar eclipses, including travel and lodging options, I recommend checking my main feed for new articles each day. Remember to keep an eye on the skies and embrace the wonder of these celestial phenomena.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66016f04433add21d5071fb4/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2004,1128,x10,y411,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 13:00:51,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobinglis/2024/03/25/avoiding-the-judgment-of-history/,Avoiding The Judgment Of History,"Art Laffer, the former economics advisor to President Ronald Reagan, recently had a meeting with former President Trump to discuss the possibility of replacing Jerome Powell as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Laffer has also expressed support for a revenue-neutral carbon tax as an effective market-based solution to tackle climate change.

Kim Beazley, Australia's former ambassador to the US, is determined to have his stance on climate change documented for future generations. He believes it is important for his children and grandchildren to know what he believed and what climate skeptics were saying.

The US House of Representatives recently passed a resolution condemning a carbon tax, despite the fact that carbon pricing is considered the most powerful tool to combat climate change. The resolution, which is non-binding, was introduced by Rep. Ryan Zinke and has previously been proposed by Rep. Steve Scalise.

However, these lawmakers seem to overlook two important aspects of a well-designed carbon tax. Firstly, it can be made revenue-neutral by offsetting it with a reduction in an existing tax, ensuring that there is no increase in the size of the government. Secondly, it can be made border-adjustable by applying the tax to imports from countries that do not tax pollution.

Ironically, the same week that the House passed the carbon tax resolution, Art Laffer was reported to have met with Donald Trump to discuss the possibility of Laffer replacing Jerome Powell as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. There were also reports about Kevin Hassett being considered for the position. Both Laffer and Hassett have advocated for solving climate change through a carbon tax paired with a reduction in existing taxes.

Both Laffer and Hassett are members of the Pigou Club, which was founded by Harvard economist Greg Mankiw, who served as George W. Bush's Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. The club is based on the ideas of Arthur Cecil Pigou, an English economist who suggested that we should tax what we want less of and untax what we want more of. In this case, we want more income and less pollution.

Those who voted for the carbon tax resolution should be asked what their problem is with such a tax swap. If their concern is that a carbon tax would disproportionately affect the poor, why not reduce taxes on payroll income and tax carbon pollution instead? This would address the regressivity issue of a standalone carbon tax. Additionally, it would strengthen Social Security, which is supported by payroll taxes, by broadening its tax base.

The drafters of the carbon tax resolution also seem to be unaware that under existing World Trade Organization rules, the US could apply its carbon tax to imports from countries without a carbon tax. This border adjustment would incentivize other countries to follow suit and impose their own carbon pollution fees. As a result, the true cost of burning fossil fuels would be reflected in the price of products. Greener and cleaner alternatives would be more affordable compared to dirty products that are held accountable for their environmental impact.

This approach would make Pigou proud as he believed that negative externalities, costs that firms and individuals impose on society, create market distortions that hinder innovation. If a company can get away with polluting without consequences, they can offer their products at a lower price than their competitors who have invested in cleaner technologies. Regulating these companies is one solution, but Dr. Milton Friedman, one of President Reagan's economic advisors, suggested that taxing them is another effective option.

It is important to remember that history will judge us all, regardless of political affiliation. Democrats who voted for the carbon tax resolution for political reasons should reconsider their stance. The good news is that the resolution is non-binding and can be rectified. We are never beyond redemption, and there is always an opportunity to make the right decision.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6601d28de733bba2fcac676c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 15:47:48,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-deep-geothermal-renewable-powerhouse.html,Dig deep: US bets on geothermal to become renewable powerhouse,"Geothermal energy has the potential to play a significant role in the green transition and become a reliable source of clean power. While it currently represents a small fraction of US energy production, businesses and the Biden administration are investing in technological advancements to expand its use.

Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm believes that harnessing the heat beneath our feet can provide clean, scalable power for industries and households alike. In fact, her department estimates that geothermal energy could surpass hydroelectric and solar power in the US by 2050.

Geothermal energy utilizes the naturally high temperatures beneath the Earth's surface to generate electricity and heat buildings. However, in 2022, it accounted for only 1.6% of US energy consumption. To increase production, the US government has invested over $200 million since 2018 in an experimental site in Utah. This site focuses on drilling exceptionally deep wells, a departure from traditional near-surface geothermal energy.

Scientists at the Utah site are testing a technology known as Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), which involves injecting water into naturally hot rocks located over two miles underground. This method does not require the presence of a hot spring or underground reservoir. Francesco d'Avack, an analyst with S&P Global Commodity Insights, believes that geothermal energy can be produced anywhere, reducing the upfront risk associated with drilling.

Another advantage of geothermal energy is that the US government is allowing companies to convert permits for oil or gas exploration into geothermal licenses, streamlining the process and reducing paperwork. Furthermore, geothermal drilling requires fewer chemical additives compared to traditional fracking methods, making it more environmentally friendly. Additionally, geothermal energy provides a consistent flow of power regardless of weather conditions or time of day, unlike solar or wind power.

In terms of cost, the US government estimates that the price of geothermal energy will decrease from the current range of $70 to $100 per megawatt hour (MWh) to $45 by 2035. The use of existing drilling technology has made geothermal energy development quicker and more cost-effective.

The US has been at the forefront of developing this new technology, with other countries like France also experimenting with EGS sites. However, one potential risk associated with geothermal drilling projects is induced seismic activity, similar to what has been observed with fracking. The US Energy Department has implemented a mitigation protocol to address induced seismicity and is funding research on this issue.

Despite these challenges, several US and Canadian start-ups are actively raising funds and vying for a position in the geothermal energy market. Companies like Fervo Energy have already connected their geothermal sites to the electric grid, with support from major corporations like Google. As demand for geothermal energy grows, big players like Google, Microsoft, and Nucor are committing to purchasing geothermal energy.

While the geothermal energy sector is still in its early stages, industry experts believe that the market is open for innovation and growth. The successful establishment of a commercial facility will pave the way for further developments in the industry.

In conclusion, geothermal energy holds great promise as a clean and reliable source of power. With advancements in technology and investments from both the public and private sectors, geothermal energy has the potential to become a significant contributor to the US energy mix. As the sector grows, it is crucial to prioritize responsible and sustainable development to ensure long-term success.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/a-worker-operates-a-dr.jpg,2024-03-25 04:59:03,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-large-language-simple-mechanism-knowledge.html,Large language models use a surprisingly simple mechanism to retrieve some stored knowledge,"Large language models (LLMs) are complex tools used in various applications, but researchers are still working to fully understand how they function. To gain insight into these models, researchers at MIT and other institutions investigated the mechanisms behind the retrieval of stored knowledge in LLMs. Surprisingly, they found that LLMs often utilize a simple linear function to decode and recover stored facts. Linear functions, which involve two variables and no exponents, capture a direct relationship between variables. By identifying linear functions for different types of facts, researchers can explore what the model knows about new subjects and where that knowledge is stored within the model.

The researchers developed a technique to estimate these simple functions and discovered that even when a model provides an incorrect answer, it often retains the correct information. This approach could potentially be used to identify and rectify falsehoods within the model, reducing instances where the model provides incorrect or nonsensical answers. While LLMs are complex and nonlinear, these findings highlight the presence of simple mechanisms within them.

The paper detailing these findings was authored by Evan Hernandez, an electrical engineering and computer science graduate student, Arnab Sharma, a computer science graduate student, Jacob Andreas, an associate professor in EECS, David Bau, an assistant professor of computer science, and others from MIT, Harvard University, and the Israeli Institute of Technology. The research will be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024).

LLMs, also known as transformer models, are neural networks that contain interconnected nodes or neurons arranged in layers to process and encode data. Within these models, knowledge is often represented as relations connecting subjects and objects. For example, the relation ""Miles Davis plays the trumpet"" connects Miles Davis to the trumpet.

As a transformer model acquires more knowledge, it stores additional facts about a particular subject across multiple layers. When a user poses a question about that subject, the model decodes the most relevant fact to provide an accurate response. The researchers aimed to understand the mechanism responsible for this decoding process.

To investigate LLMs, the researchers conducted a series of experiments and discovered that, despite their complexity, these models use a simple linear function to decode relational information. Each function is specific to the type of fact being retrieved. For instance, the model applies one decoding function to output the instrument a person plays and a different function to output the state where a person was born.

The researchers developed a method to estimate these simple functions and calculated functions for 47 different relations, such as ""capital city of a country"" and ""lead singer of a band."" While there are countless possible relations, the researchers focused on this subset as they represent the types of facts that can be expressed using linear functions.

To test the functions, the researchers altered the subject to determine if the model could retrieve the correct object information. Through this process, they confirmed the effectiveness of the linear functions in decoding stored facts.

These findings shed light on the inner workings of LLMs and provide valuable insights into their knowledge retrieval processes. By understanding these mechanisms, researchers can work towards improving the accuracy and reliability of large language models.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/large-language-models-2.jpg,2024-03-25 09:34:06,Innovation,Innovation

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-high-efficiency-based-copperiodide-clusters.html,A high efficiency LED based on copper-iodide clusters,"A team of researchers from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), led by Prof. Yao Hongbin, has made a significant breakthrough in the development of warm white light-emitting diodes (LEDs). These LEDs are based on copper-iodide cluster hybrids and offer high efficiency and brightness. The findings of their study have been published in Nature Photonics, highlighting the potential of this technology.

Solution-processed LEDs are considered to be the future of large-area solid-state lighting due to their simple manufacturing process and high operability. Currently, solution-processed LED devices based on lead-halide perovskites, organic semiconductor materials, and colloidal core-shell quantum dots (QDs) have demonstrated impressive electroluminescence performance.

However, the use of materials containing heavy metals like lead-halide perovskites and CdSe QDs raises serious environmental concerns. On the other hand, LED devices based on organic light-emitting molecules, InP QDs, and ZnSe QDs have high production costs due to the complexity of their synthesis. Therefore, developing solution-processed LEDs based on low-cost, low-toxicity, easily scalable, and highly efficient emitters is a critical challenge for the advancement of solid-state lighting.

To address this challenge, Prof. Yao's team focused on designing and preparing a copper-iodine-based hybrid cluster with a broad photoluminescence spectrum. By introducing nitrogen-phosphine chelating ligands and phosphine-containing solubilizing ligands, they successfully obtained copper-iodide hybrid clusters that exhibit both high luminescence efficiency and high solubility. These clusters have a solubility of over 200 mg/mL and good structural stability in N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF), a cross-solvent used in LED production.

The team then fabricated luminescent thin films using spin-coating in DMF, resulting in films with a low surface roughness of 0.22 nm and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of over 70%. These films can serve as a luminescent layer for producing low-cost warm white LED devices through an orthogonal solvent route.

The LED devices developed by the team achieved exceptional performance. They achieved a maximum external quantum efficiency of 19.1%, a brightness exceeding 40,000 cd m-2, and an operational lifetime of over 232 hours (T 50 @100 cd m-2). Furthermore, utilizing the good solubility and processability of the clusters, the team successfully constructed a large-area solution-processed LED device with a working area of 36 cm2 using blade-coating. This device exhibited warm white light emission with a brightness close to 60,000 cd m-2.

In addition to warm white LEDs, the team also developed a series of solution-processed color-tunable LED devices by modifying different electron-donating groups on the nitrogen heterocycles of the nitrogen-phosphine chelating ligands.

Overall, the team's work has demonstrated the feasibility of developing high-efficiency and high-brightness LED devices based on copper-iodide hybrid clusters. These clusters offer structural expandability and spectral tunability, making them a promising choice for fabricating low-cost, high-performance LED panels and solid-state lighting.

The achievement of the USTC team is a significant step forward in the field of LED technology. Their research opens up new possibilities for the development of energy-efficient lighting solutions that are environmentally friendly and cost-effective. With further advancements in this area, we can expect to see more efficient and affordable LED lighting options in the near future.
