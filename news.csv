https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/apple-sued-microsofts-ai-ambitions-and-nvidia-surprises/,"Apple sued, Microsoft's AI ambitions and Nvidia's surprises","Welcome to this edition of Week in Review, where we bring you the latest updates on the Apple antitrust lawsuit and Microsoft's AI ambitions. Let's dive right in.

The U.S. has joined international regulators in accusing Apple of using monopolistic tactics to lock in iPhone users. In response, Apple claims that the actions taken by the Department of Justice (DOJ) could ruin the very things that its users enjoy about its phones and ecosystem.

While the DOJ's lawsuit draws a comparison between Apple and Microsoft in the 1990s, there are key differences between the two companies and their efforts to retain customers. It's important to note that the outcome of the lawsuit is not expected to have an immediate impact. Experts predict that it could take three to five years for it to reach a resolution.

Moving on to other news, Microsoft recently acquired the co-founders of Inflection AI, a high-profile AI startup. Mustafa Suleyman will now lead Microsoft AI's consumer-facing unit, while Kar√©n Simonyan will serve as the EVP and CEO of the same group. This acquisition comes after Inflection raised $1.3 billion, with Microsoft being its biggest investor.

Nvidia's recent GTC developer conference brought a couple of surprises. CEO Jensen Huang predicted that artificial general intelligence is just five years away. Additionally, Nvidia announced a new AI platform called GR00T, specifically designed for humanoid robots.

In other exciting news, Google and Apple are reportedly in talks that could lead to Google's AI model being deployed to power upcoming iOS updates. The nature of this partnership is still unclear, but it raises questions about whether it's a temporary solution or a long-term collaboration.

Now, let's discuss some important issues regarding hacking and privacy. The Biden administration is forming an international coalition to combat commercial spyware, and investors are now joining the fight. However, it has been revealed that one of these investors was previously involved in the very business they are now fighting against.

In the gaming world, a recent hack temporarily halted an Apex Legends tournament. The hackers claimed it was done for fun and to bring attention to the exploit used. This incident serves as a reminder of the vulnerabilities that exist in online gaming.

Glassdoor users have reported that their real names are being added to their profiles without their consent. The only solution provided to them is to delete their accounts completely. This serves as a reminder to carefully review your privacy settings on online platforms.

In terms of funding and IPOs, Reddit's IPO had a strong start, with the stock jumping 48% on its first day. Astera Labs, a company specializing in connectivity hardware for cloud computing data centers, also experienced success, with its stock closing at $62.03 on its first day.

Lastly, The Browser Company, the startup behind the Arc browser, raised $50 million at a valuation of $550 million. The company aims to supplant PCs with browsers, but its path to monetization remains unclear.

In our bonus round, we explore why AI still struggles with spelling, despite its massive potential. Additionally, Fisker, an EV manufacturer, has paused production due to financial difficulties. The company may have to cease operations if it fails to raise more capital.

In conclusion, while AI systems like ChatGPT and Gemini cannot be fully reviewed, it is crucial to put them to the test to understand their capabilities and limitations. Stay tuned for more updates in the next edition of Week in Review.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/apple-antitrust-doj-splash.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-23 20:15:37,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/24/new-whatsapp-warning-iphone-15-pro-max-samsung-s24-ultra-upgrade/,New WhatsApp Warning Suddenly Issued For 2 Billion Users,"WhatsApp's recent upgrade has introduced a hidden setting that should be avoided at all costs due to its potential dangers. This year, 2024, is expected to bring significant changes to the global messaging landscape, including iMessage co-opting RCS, WhatsApp's third-party chat hub, Gemini AI integrating with Google Messages, and the DOJ lawsuit against Apple, where iMessage plays a central role.

Many of these changes have led to a misunderstanding of the end-to-end encryption used by messaging platforms like iMessage, WhatsApp, and Signal for years. Recently, Google Messages and Facebook Messenger have made end-to-end encryption the default setting. This level of encryption is crucial and has prompted WhatsApp to caution users that third-party chats are not as secure as WhatsApp-to-WhatsApp chats. It has also led the DOJ to warn that Apple's refusal to provide full iMessage security on Android makes iPhone users less secure. Despite pressure from governments and security agencies, Facebook Messenger has also adopted end-to-end encryption by default.

Surprisingly, some media reports have encouraged users to transfer their existing chats and chat histories from WhatsApp to Telegram. WhatsApp provides an export setting within the chat menu, allowing users to select Telegram as the recipient. In 2021, Telegram announced that users could bring their chat history, including videos and documents, from apps like WhatsApp to Telegram. However, this recommendation is alarming because Telegram does not provide end-to-end encryption by default. Its ""secret chat"" option must be selected for each individual chat. Kaspersky warned last year that ""Telegram isn't as secure as its developers boast"" and that users are not informed about the secure chat option. Moving chats from WhatsApp, which is end-to-end encrypted by default, to Telegram, which isn't, poses a significant security risk, especially for group chats containing otherwise secure content from multiple users.

Even though WhatsApp has faced backlash recently after Meta (formerly Facebook) threatened to change user terms and conditions, promoting Telegram as an alternative for chat migration is a dangerous mistake. Jake Moore from ESET advises against pulling content out of end-to-end encrypted messaging platforms, as it removes the barriers designed to protect messages. While accessibility is important, sacrificing security and privacy during the transition is not worth it. Telegram promotes its cross-platform ease of use, but that is only possible because any client can access content on its central servers. If Telegram were end-to-end encrypted, this would not be possible. Additionally, Telegram offers reduced smartphone storage by storing everything in the cloud, but its architecture prioritizes access and simplicity over full encryption. The security of your data depends on policy rather than technology.

Therefore, it is strongly recommended not to follow the advice to switch from WhatsApp to Telegram. Despite its marketing, Telegram is a step backward in terms of security. Furthermore, there are other issues to consider. Telegram serves two opposite roles in the messaging world. On one hand, it aims to be an easy-to-use alternative to WhatsApp, which is why the migration option exists. On the other hand, Telegram has been associated with lack of content controls and has been described as ""social media for organized criminals."" It is not only used by criminals but also by campaigners and activists of all kinds. The platform has experienced a rapid rise in recent years, becoming an essential source of news and a resource for organizing, even in geopolitical and human rights contexts.

In conclusion, it is crucial to prioritize security and privacy when choosing a messaging platform. While Telegram may seem appealing with its ease of use and storage benefits, its lack of default end-to-end encryption and association with criminal activity should raise concerns. Stick with messaging platforms like WhatsApp, which provide end-to-end encryption by default, to ensure the highest level of security for your chats and protect your privacy.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65b41420a2b346798e66d370/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2207,1442,x681,y315,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 23:45:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2024/03/25/what-every-ceo-needs-to-know-about-the-new-ai-act/,What Every CEO Needs To Know About The New AI Act,"What Every CEO Needs To Know About The New AI Act

Having recently passed the Artificial Intelligence Act, the European Union is about to bring into force some of the world's toughest AI regulations. Potentially dangerous AI applications have been designated ""unacceptable"" and will be illegal except for government, law enforcement, and scientific study under specific conditions. As was true with GDPR, this new EU legislation will create new obligations for anyone who does business within the 27 member states, not just the companies based there. Those responsible for writing it have said that the aim is to protect citizens' rights and freedoms while also fostering innovation and entrepreneurship. But the 460-odd published pages of the Act contain a lot more than that.

If you run a business that operates in Europe or sells to European consumers, though, there are some important things you need to know. Here are what stands out to me as the key takeaways for anyone who wants to be prepared for potentially significant changes.

When Does It Come Into Force?

The Artificial Intelligence Act was adopted by the EU Parliament on March 13 and is expected to soon become law when it is passed by the European Council. It will take up to 24 months for all of it to be enforced, but enforcement of certain aspects, such as the newly banned practices, could start to happen in as little as six months. As was the case with GDPR, this delay is to let companies ensure they're compliant. After this deadline, they could face significant penalties for any breaches. These are tiered, with the most serious reserved for those breaking the ""unacceptable uses"" ban. At the top end are fines of up to 30 million euros, or six percent of the company's global turnover (whichever is higher!)

Potentially even more damaging, though, would be the impact on a business's reputation if it's found to be breaking the new laws. Trust is everything in the world of AI, and businesses that show they can't be trusted are likely to be further punished by consumers.

Some Uses Of AI Will Be Banned

The act states that ""AI should be a human-centric technology. It should serve as a tool for people, with the ultimate aim of increasing human well-being."" In order to do that, the EU has prohibited the use of AI for a number of potentially harmful purposes. Those specifically listed include:

- Using AI to influence or change behaviors in ways that are harmful.
- Biometric classification to infer political and religious beliefs or sexual preference or orientation.
- Social scoring systems that could lead to discrimination.
- Remotely identifying people via biometrics in public places (facial recognition systems, for example.)

There are some exemptions. There's a list of situations where law enforcement organizations can deploy ""unacceptable"" AIs, including preventing terrorism and locating missing people. There are also exemptions for scientific study. The Act says ""AI should be a human-centric technology. It should serve as a tool for people, with the ultimate aim of increasing human well-being."" So it's good to see that limiting the ways it could cause harm has been put at the heart of the new laws.

However, there is a fair amount of ambiguity and openness around some of the wording, which could potentially leave things open to interpretation. Could the use of AI to target marketing for products like fast food and high-sugar soft drinks be considered to influence behaviors in harmful ways? And how do we judge whether a social scoring system will lead to discrimination in a world where we're used to being credit-checked and scored by a multitude of government and private bodies? This is an area where we will have to wait for more guidance or information on how enforcement will be applied to understand the full consequences.

High-Risk AI

Aside from the uses deemed unacceptable, the act breaks down AI tools into three further categories ‚Äì high, limited and minimal risk. High-risk AI includes use cases like self-driving cars and medical applications. Businesses involved in these or similarly risky fields will find themselves facing stricter rules as well as a greater obligation around data quality and protection. Limited and minimal-risk use cases could include applications of AI purely for entertainment, such as in video games, or in creative processes such as generating text, video, or sounds. There will be fewer requirements here, although there will still be expectations regarding transparency and ethical use of intellectual property.

Transparency

The Act makes it clear that AI should be as transparent as possible. Again, there's some ambiguity here‚Äîat least in the eyes of someone like me who isn't a lawyer. Stipulations are made, for example, around cases where there is a need to ""protect trade secrets and confidential business information."" But it's uncertain right now how this would be interpreted when cases start coming before courts.

The act covers transparency in two ways. First, it decrees that AI systems must be transparent to users, allowing them to understand how the technology works and why certain decisions are being made. Second, it requires developers and providers of high-risk AI systems to document their development process, including the data used, the algorithms employed, and any testing or validation done. This is to ensure that these systems can be audited and assessed for safety, accuracy, and compliance with the law.

Conclusion

The new AI Act is a significant development in the regulation of artificial intelligence. It places a strong emphasis on protecting citizens' rights and well-being while also recognizing the potential for innovation and entrepreneurship. Businesses operating in Europe or selling to European consumers need to be aware of the Act's provisions and ensure they are compliant. The Act prohibits certain uses of AI that could be harmful or discriminatory, and it introduces stricter rules for high-risk AI applications. Transparency is also a key requirement, with AI systems expected to be transparent to users and developers required to document their processes. As with any new legislation, there may be some ambiguity and interpretation issues that arise, but it is crucial for businesses to stay informed and adapt to these new regulations.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660119636c929844c48ce7dd/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 02:28:31,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2024/03/24/the-walking-dead-the-ones-who-live-episode-5-review---another-massively-disappointing-episode/,‚ÄòThe Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live‚Äô Episode 5 Review - Another Massively Disappointing Episode,"The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live has been a rollercoaster ride so far, and the latest episode, ""Become,"" continues to keep viewers on their toes. While there were some enjoyable moments, the episode also had its fair share of implausibilities that left me scratching my head.

One of the highlights of the episode was the unexpected appearance of Gabriel, played by Seth Gilliam. The flashback scenes with Gabriel and Jadis, portrayed by Pollyanna McIntosh, added an element of suspense. I was genuinely concerned that Gabriel might meet his demise, which would have been a bold move for the series. However, it seems that The Walking Dead is playing it safe these days, as it was Jadis who ultimately met her end.

Another character who has been a disappointment in recent seasons is Morgan, played by Lennie James. Once a favorite of mine, Morgan's character has been mishandled and wasted. It's unfortunate to see such a talented actor be underutilized. The writers have taken Morgan's story in strange directions, with moments of insanity and the infamous ""You know what it is!"" catchphrase. It's a shame to see a character with so much potential be reduced to this.

Moving on to the plot, there were several moments that stretched believability. Rick and Michonne, played by Andrew Lincoln and Danai Gurira, stumble upon a trio of survivors who are being attacked by ""stoners,"" zombies who have turned into stone walkers. Initially portrayed as formidable foes, these stone walkers are easily dispatched by our heroes. The encounter quickly turns from a tense standoff to a one-sided beatdown. Rick and Michonne even go as far as returning the survivors' weapons, trusting them to be good from now on. This decision left me baffled. While I understand not wanting to kill them, giving them back their weapons on a promise seems foolish.

This brings me to a recurring question that has plagued The Walking Dead: how do characters this incompetent manage to survive in the apocalypse? At this point, one would expect anyone they come across to be as skilled and resourceful as Rick and Michonne. It's hard to believe that after over a decade into the apocalypse, there are still individuals who lack basic survival skills. It's a glaring inconsistency that takes away from the realism of the show.

On a lighter note, Rick and Michonne's relationship has taken center stage in recent episodes. They seem to find every opportunity to engage in romantic moments, including in the middle of fights. It's amusing to see their relationship take this turn, considering how little romantic development they had in the earlier seasons. At this point, it's safe to say that they're more than a little smitten with each other.

Despite the questionable decisions made by the characters, Rick and Michonne have found themselves in some fortunate situations. Last week, they stumbled upon a fully-powered smart home where they decided to have a romantic encounter as the building collapsed around them. This week, they find the Three Pines Cabin, a cozy retreat where they can relax and enjoy each other's company. However, as expected, their peace is short-lived when Jadis arrives the next morning, guns blazing.

In conclusion, ""Become"" had its ups and downs. While there were enjoyable moments, the implausibilities and inconsistent character development weighed it down. The Walking Dead continues to be a show that keeps viewers guessing, but it's important for the writers to maintain a level of believability to keep the audience engaged. I'm curious to see how the season finale will wrap up the storylines and whether it will leave us satisfied or wanting more.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600b341eca045b614f49ec5/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=800,450,x0,y41,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 21:39:14,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/25/google-upgrade-samsung-s24-s23-pixel-towards-apple-iphone-15-pro-max/,Google Suddenly Reveals Surprise Android Update That Beats iPhone,"Android and iPhone are in constant competition to attract users. Google has been making efforts to make Android more similar to iPhone in recent updates, including enhanced security features, WhatsApp calls on the phone dialer, and the addition of Apple passes to its wallet. The latest update from Google not only matches an existing iPhone feature but goes beyond it. Google has introduced an emergency satellite service that matches the satellite SOS functionality on the iPhone. This new feature enhances the safety and security of Android users.

One limitation of Apple's emergency SOS feature is that it is only useful for emergencies. It displays an SOS tag on the screen when users are out of coverage, but it is not something that everyday users need. However, with the latest Android 15 developer preview, Google is bridging this gap. Users will now have the option to expand their cellular accounts to include a satellite add-on, allowing core messaging apps to use the satellite network. This means that users will no longer experience dropped calls or loss of connectivity in cellular black spots.

The Android 15 developer preview also includes UI elements to ensure a consistent user experience for devices that support satellite connectivity. Additionally, it introduces a new API that apps can use to detect when a device is connected to a satellite. This update allows SMS/MMS/RCS apps to use satellite connectivity for sending and receiving messages. This is a significant development, especially considering that some networks have plans to add LEO satellite connectivity as an account option.

Apple's satellite connectivity is more limited compared to Android. With select iPhone models, users can connect their devices to a satellite to text emergency services, request roadside assistance, and share their location with friends and family when they have no mobile or Wi-Fi coverage. Android, on the other hand, has the potential to go even further, with beta code suggesting a satellite messaging option in partnership with T-Mobile. Elon Musk's announcement that SpaceX achieved download speeds of 17mbps to an unmodified Galaxy S21 Ultra further supports the idea of direct-to-phone satellite connectivity becoming more commonplace in the future.

While we wait for direct satellite connectivity to become the norm, the integration of satellite messaging into Android 15 is a great start. This development confirms that Android is moving ahead of iPhone in terms of innovation. It is expected that Apple will follow Google's lead in this area. This news comes shortly after rumors that Gemini, a powerful AI tool, might be coming to iPhone, potentially closing the gap between Android and iPhone even further.

In conclusion, Google's latest update to Android brings exciting satellite connectivity features that match and surpass Apple's existing capabilities. Android 15 allows users to expand their cellular accounts to include a satellite add-on, enabling core messaging apps to use the satellite network. This development enhances the safety and connectivity of Android users and brings Android one step closer to iPhone in terms of features and innovation. With the potential for direct-to-phone satellite connectivity in the future, this is an exciting time for Android users.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65d79ec3dadcd6b682668331/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 00:06:15,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-deep-geothermal-renewable-powerhouse.html,Dig deep: US bets on geothermal to become renewable powerhouse,"Geothermal energy has long been regarded as a niche source of power in the United States. However, recent technological advancements and the push for green energy solutions have sparked renewed interest in geothermal as a key player in the country's transition to a sustainable future. With its ability to provide clean, reliable, and scalable power, many businesses and the Biden administration are placing their bets on geothermal energy.

According to Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, capturing the heat beneath our feet has the potential to revolutionize energy production. Speaking at the CERAWeek conference in Houston, Granholm highlighted the numerous benefits of geothermal energy. The Department of Energy estimates that geothermal could surpass hydroelectric and solar power by 2050 in the United States.

Currently, geothermal energy only accounts for a small fraction of US energy consumption, totaling 1.6 percent in 2022. To increase production, the US government has invested over $200 million in an experimental site in Utah. Unlike traditional geothermal energy, which relies on near-surface sources, the Utah site focuses on Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS). This approach involves drilling exceptionally deep wells and injecting water into naturally hot rocks to generate power.

Francesco d'Avack, an analyst with S&P Global Commodity Insights, explains that geothermal energy can theoretically be harnessed anywhere. This flexibility reduces the upfront risk associated with drilling and increases the appeal for potential investors. Granholm also emphasized that the US government is streamlining the permitting process for oil and gas exploration companies interested in converting to geothermal energy, making it easier for them to transition.

In terms of environmental impact, geothermal energy is a more sustainable alternative to traditional fracking techniques used in oil and gas extraction. Geothermal drilling requires fewer chemical additives and does not release hydrocarbons into the environment. Additionally, unlike solar or wind power, geothermal provides a consistent source of energy, regardless of weather conditions or time of day.

When it comes to cost, the US government predicts that geothermal energy will become more affordable over time. Currently, the cost ranges from $70 to $100 per megawatt hour (MWh), but it is expected to drop to $45 by 2035. The use of existing drilling technology makes geothermal development quicker and cheaper compared to other renewable energy sources.

The United States has taken the lead in developing this new geothermal technology. Ajit Menon, a specialist in subterranean development at Baker Hughes, acknowledges the US as a first mover in this field. While experimental EGS sites exist in other countries, such as France, commercial-scale projects have yet to be realized.

However, there are potential risks associated with geothermal drilling, including induced seismicity. Similar to fracking, geothermal projects have the potential to cause seismic activity. The US Energy Department has implemented a mitigation protocol to address this issue and is funding research to further understand and minimize seismic events.

Despite these challenges, several US and Canadian start-ups are emerging in the geothermal market, attracting significant investments. Fervo Energy, for example, partnered with Google to connect its Nevada site to the electric grid. This collaboration demonstrates the growing demand for geothermal energy, with major companies like Google, Microsoft, and Nucor committing to purchasing geothermal power.

Cindy Taff, CEO of Sage Geosystems, believes that the geothermal market is still in its early stages, with plenty of room for growth. The first successful commercial facility will pave the way for future projects, attracting more investors and driving further industry expansion.

As the world seeks sustainable energy solutions to combat climate change, geothermal energy presents a promising opportunity. With its ability to provide clean, reliable, and scalable power, geothermal has the potential to become a significant player in the green energy transition. By investing in technological advancements and streamlining the permitting process, the United States is positioning itself as a leader in geothermal energy development. As the market expands and demand grows, geothermal energy has the potential to reshape the energy landscape for generations to come.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/a-worker-operates-a-dr.jpg,2024-03-25 04:59:03,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/techcrunch-mobility-the-wheels-are-starting-to-come-off-the-fisker-ev-bus/,TechCrunch Mobility: The wheels are starting to come off the Fisker EV bus,"Welcome to TechCrunch Mobility, your go-to source for all things transportation. In this edition, we'll be discussing the recent developments on Capitol Hill, as well as some exciting news from the world of EV startups. So buckle up and let's dive in!

The Biden Administration has recently proposed two new standards through the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency that will have a significant impact on U.S. automakers and consumers. While these regulations have been softened to appease various industry stakeholders, they still impose stricter standards than before.

The DOE has introduced a ""petroleum equivalency factor"" that assigns EVs a score under the government's corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. This proposal initially posed challenges for automakers to meet CAFE standards, potentially resulting in hefty fines. However, the revised version is more lenient, providing some relief to the industry.

On the other hand, the EPA has released tailpipe standards for 2027 to 2032 model year vehicles, which place greater requirements on automakers. However, these standards are technology-agnostic, allowing automakers to meet them using various powertrains, not just battery electric vehicles. This is a departure from the original proposal, which demanded that EV sales make up 67% of the U.S. passenger vehicle market by 2032.

While these regulations don't have a significant impact on EV startups like Rivian, Tesla, and Lucid, they do pose challenges for traditional automakers. Legacy manufacturers are investing billions in EV development while still relying on profits from internal combustion engine vehicles. Plug-in hybrids may be the winners in this scenario, as they bridge the gap between traditional and electric vehicles.

Now, let's shift our focus to the latest news in the EV startup world. One noteworthy development is Rivian's partnership with Tesla, which has generated quite a buzz. Additionally, electric boat startup Candela has secured $25 million in funding, signaling a growing interest in alternative forms of transportation.

On the flip side, Fisker, an EV startup that has garnered attention in recent years, is facing financial difficulties. The company is experiencing continued fallout, which could impact its future endeavors.

In the realm of autonomous delivery technology, Clevon, a company that has been developing this technology since 2018, has faced challenges in securing new investments. However, there is still hope for the company, as it has entered into an exclusivity agreement for a merger with an American electric vehicle company. The deal is expected to be finalized in the first half of June.

Uber, known for its ubiquitous presence, has made its first investment in an Africa-founded startup. Moove, a mobility fintech company, raised $100 million in a Series B funding round led by Uber. This investment aligns with Uber's commitment to a fully zero-emission fleet by 2040.

Lastly, Amber, a Bay Area startup, has launched an aftermarket Tesla extended warranty product. The company has raised $3.18 million in a seed round, demonstrating the market's interest in innovative solutions for EV owners.
