https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) may seem like unlikely parallels, but these two companies actually have quite a bit in common. Both Nvidia and AWS stumbled upon their core businesses by accident. AWS discovered that it could sell the services it had created for its own internal use, such as storage and computing power. Similarly, Nvidia found that its gaming-focused GPU was well-suited for processing AI workloads.

These fortuitous discoveries have led to explosive revenue growth for both companies. Nvidia's revenue has skyrocketed from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024 to $22.1 billion in Q4 2024, a triple-digit growth rate. However, the majority of this growth can be attributed to Nvidia's data center business. On the other hand, AWS has consistently been a major revenue driver for Amazon, and it currently operates at a run rate close to $100 billion.

Both Nvidia and AWS were able to capitalize on being in the right place at the right time. As web apps and mobile usage increased in the early 2010s, the cloud became a valuable resource for enterprises looking to move their workloads and applications. Similarly, the rise of AI and large language models coincided with the increased use of GPUs for processing these workloads.

While AWS has grown into a highly profitable business, its growth has begun to slow down. Meanwhile, Nvidia's growth is taking off. However, Nvidia will eventually face the same challenges as AWS due to the law of large numbers. The question remains whether Nvidia can sustain its growth and become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS.

In terms of short-term financial outlook, Nvidia's revenue growth has been astronomical in recent quarters, and it is expected to continue. In its recent earnings report, Nvidia projected $24 billion worth of revenue for its current quarter, representing a 234% growth compared to the same period a year ago. However, as the company's revenue ramps up, the growth rate is expected to decline. Analysts predict that Nvidia will generate around $110.5 billion in revenue for the current fiscal year, an 81% increase from the previous year.

Despite the anticipated decline in growth rates, Nvidia is still expected to scale its revenue past the $100 billion annual run rate mark for several more quarters. This level of growth is impressive for a company that had only $7.19 billion in total revenue just a year ago.

Looking ahead, AI appears to be the driving force behind Nvidia's continued growth. Even as competition from AMD, Intel, and other chipmakers emerges, Nvidia controls a significant portion of the market. The dominance of Nvidia's chips is evident when looking at market share data. However, AMD is gaining ground at the board level. Nevertheless, Nvidia's strong position in the market allows it to withstand competition and continue its momentum.

In conclusion, Nvidia and AWS share similarities in their accidental discoveries that became the basis of their core businesses. Both companies have experienced explosive revenue growth, although AWS's growth has slowed down while Nvidia's is still accelerating. It remains to be seen if Nvidia can maintain its growth and become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS. However, with its strong position in the market and the continued demand for AI, Nvidia is well-positioned for future success.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/non-sexy-industries-can-appeal-to-investors-too/,Non-sexy industries can appeal to investors too,"Welcome to TechCrunch Fintech! In this edition, we will be exploring some exciting fintech startups in Africa, discussing how Mint's closure has benefited Copilot, and diving into the reasons why VCs are showing increased interest in a particular expense management startup.

Africa's Fintech Ecosystem Thrives Amid Global Funding Decline
Although venture funding has decreased globally, Africa's fintech ecosystem had a promising week. Uber led a $100 million investment in African mobility fintech company Moove, raising its valuation to $750 million. Zone also secured $8.5 million in funding to expand its decentralized payment infrastructure. Additionally, Tanzanian payments company Nala successfully pivoted to offer remittance services, leading to the development of a B2B payment platform.

Opportunity Arises for Startups as Mint Closes
The closure of budgeting app Mint has opened doors for startups in the same space. Copilot, in particular, has experienced tremendous growth in the past four months, surpassing its growth in the previous four years. This growth enabled Copilot to secure a $6 million Series A funding round led by Adjacent. The demise of Mint has also been advantageous for Monarch Money, according to co-founder Ozzie Osman.

Investors Show Interest in Non-Sexy Industries
Expense management startup Coast has attracted investors by targeting businesses that manage real-world field personnel and fleets. With a revenue growth of 550% last year, the company recently secured $25 million in equity funding. Onyx Private, a digital bank originally focused on serving high-earning millennials and Gen Zers, has pivoted to a B2B model. Despite raising $4.1 million last year, Onyx Private has decided to terminate its bank operations.

Swiss Fintech nsave Raises $4 Million
Swiss fintech company nsave has raised $4 million in seed funding. The company aims to provide accessible banking services in Switzerland to individuals in countries with unstable banking sectors or facing high inflation.

The Future Potential of Fintech
Eric Glyman, the co-founder and CEO of Ramp, believes that the fintech industry is only scratching the surface of its potential. Despite significant growth, Glyman claims that Ramp has tapped into just 1% of its potential market share. On a related note, both Ramp and Deel celebrated their fifth anniversaries this week.
