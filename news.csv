https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/bankrupt-ev-startup-arrival-sold-its-assets-to-canoo/,Bankrupt EV startup Arrival sold its assets to Canoo,"Bankrupt electric vehicle (EV) startup Arrival has sold some of its assets, including advanced manufacturing equipment, to struggling startup Canoo, which is also trying to build and sell EVs. This acquisition is seen as a cost-saving measure for Canoo, expected to reduce capital expenditures by 20%. Canoo plans to send the purchased assets, packed into more than 20 container ships, to its facility in Oklahoma. It remains unclear whether Canoo also acquired any of Arrival's intellectual property (IP). Canoo has not responded to a request for comment.

Arrival announced in January that it intended to sell off assets and IP from its U.K. division after filing for bankruptcy protection. Previously valued at over $13 billion and backed by Hyundai and UPS, Arrival aimed to revolutionize EV production by building compact ""microfactories"" in city centers. However, its plans, which included an electric bus, vans, and a purpose-built car for Uber, fell apart due to financial issues and executive turnover. Arrival restructured multiple times, laying off workers, and shifted its focus to the U.S. market. The company never achieved large-scale production of commercial vehicles, and its market valuation now stands at around $7.7 million. After significant volatility and a sharp decline in share price, Arrival filed for bankruptcy.

Canoo has faced its own challenges. After going public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, the company struggled to produce its EV, which featured an eye-catching design based on a ""skateboard"" architecture. This design houses the batteries and electric drivetrain in a chassis beneath the vehicle's cabin. Canoo reported having more than $1 billion in its sales pipeline, largely due to a deal with Walmart to purchase 4,500 units, with an option for up to 10,000 units. However, the company has experienced difficulties converting these sales into deliveries. Canoo, a pre-revenue company, is burning through cash and has resorted to stock splits and issuing more shares to stay afloat. Last year, the company moved to a different tier in the Nasdaq Exchange after its stock price fell below $1, triggering a delisting notice.

Despite their struggles, both Arrival and Canoo represent the ongoing efforts in the EV industry to develop innovative and sustainable transportation solutions. While Arrival's bankruptcy and asset sale signify a setback, Canoo's acquisition of manufacturing equipment provides an opportunity for the company to advance toward commercial production. As the EV market continues to evolve, it remains to be seen whether these startups can overcome their challenges and contribute to the broader shift towards electric mobility.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/canoo-walmart-arkansas.jpg?resize=1200,670",2024-03-25 22:15:20,Innovation,Innovation
