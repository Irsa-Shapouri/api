https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/mallard-bay-airbnb-for-guided-hunting-and-fishing/,Mallard Bay is the Airbnb for guided hunting and fishing,"Americans spent a staggering $144.8 billion on fishing and hunting in 2022, as reported by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. While guided hunting and fishing excursions are a significant part of this industry, they have primarily remained offline, with bookings being made over the phone and payments made through physical checks or cash. However, Mallard Bay, a Houston-based startup, aims to change that.

Mallard Bay is a marketplace that allows consumers who hunt and fish to find and book guided tours online, similar to booking a hotel. Additionally, Mallard Bay serves as a vertical SaaS platform for outfitters, enabling them to bring their back office online and offer additional services such as marketing.

Recently, the startup announced a successful $4.6 million Series A funding round, led by Soul Venture Partners, with participation from existing investor Acadian Capital Ventures and other angel investors. Logan Meaux, the co-founder and CEO of Mallard Bay, was inspired to create the company after a disappointing hunting trip with his dad during college. They had intended to book a three-day guided duck hunt in Oklahoma but discovered upon arrival that the hunt had been double-booked. Their only option was to hunt for one day alongside 13 other people, and Meaux never even fired a shot.

At the time, Meaux was working for his dad's startup, Waitr, which had raised $24 million in venture capital before exiting in 2018. Drawing from his experience, Meaux believed he could launch a successful company of his own. In 2019, he teamed up with two other co-founders, and their initial idea was to create a marketplace similar to Airbnb for booking guided hunts. However, after consulting with outfitters and guides, they realized they needed to offer more to entice them to join the platform. This led to the development of Guidetech, Mallard Bay's back office solution for outfitters.

Outfitters were receptive to the idea of going digital, recognizing the importance of keeping up with the times. However, many outfitters were primarily passionate about guiding rather than running a business. Mallard Bay bridged this gap by combining their passion for the outdoors with their expertise in software, effectively offering outfitters the support they needed to transition online.

The platform gained traction after securing hunting influencer Toby Brohlin as a user, leading to an influx of outfitters signing up. Brohlin alone has generated over $1 million in gross bookings, and the platform as a whole facilitated more than $6 million in gross bookings in 2023. Mallard Bay is projected to reach $30 million to $35 million in gross bookings in 2024.

Despite the market potential and the company's success, Meaux faced challenges in securing investors. Mallard Bay approached over 270 investors before closing the Series A round. Many investors were unfamiliar with the hunting and fishing category and had preconceived negative notions about it. Mallard Bay emphasized that their platform was not intended for booking exotic hunting trips in Africa but rather focused on ethical hunting and fishing practices that contribute to conservation efforts.

Meaux highlighted the inherent connection between hunting and fishing and conservation. As hunters and fishermen pass down their knowledge to future generations, they instill the importance of sustainable practices and wildlife management. Without these practices, overpopulation can have detrimental effects on wildlife. Mallard Bay is passionate about promoting ethical and sustainable hunting and fishing practices.

As someone who is not personally involved in hunting or fishing, Mallard Bay's story caught my attention. It is uncommon to hear about hunting or fishing in the startup and tech ecosystem. The concept of hunting SaaS is intriguing, and Mallard Bay is not the only hunting-related company to secure funding recently. HLRBO, an online platform that simplifies the process of finding hunting land leases, raised a $1 million seed round in February.

What sets Mallard Bay apart is its substantial growth since its launch in 2021. The company has achieved a remarkable 600% year-over-year increase in bookings. This growth is particularly impressive in a niche market like hunting and fishing. It is a testament to the potential of niche markets, which are often larger than initially perceived.

Outdoor activities, including hunting and fishing, account for over $394 billion in spending by people in the U.S. However, many industries within this sector continue to rely on outdated offline practices or subpar technology. I personally experienced this challenge when attempting to find parking for a hike on Sedona, Arizona's popular Devil's Bridge trail. I had to gather information from various sources to determine if a parking pass was required.

These examples illustrate the need for innovative solutions like Mallard Bay in the outdoor industry. By leveraging technology and providing a user-friendly platform, Mallard Bay is revolutionizing the way hunting and fishing enthusiasts book guided tours. Their success demonstrates the potential for growth in niche markets and the importance of sustainable practices in conservation efforts. As Mallard Bay continues to thrive, it is sure to inspire other startups to pursue unique opportunities in unconventional industries.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/greysen-johnson-cZVzzFadTMc-unsplash.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-23 16:00:34,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/apple-sued-microsofts-ai-ambitions-and-nvidia-surprises/,"Apple sued, Microsoft's AI ambitions and Nvidia's surprises","Welcome to this edition of Week in Review, where we bring you the latest news and updates in the tech industry. In this week's edition, we have some big news on the Apple antitrust lawsuit and Microsoft's AI ambitions. So let's dive right in!

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has joined international regulators in accusing Apple of using monopolistic tactics to lock in iPhone users. Apple, on the other hand, claims that the DOJ's actions could ruin what its users enjoy about its phones and ecosystem. This lawsuit draws a comparison between Apple and Microsoft in the 1990s, although there are significant differences between the two companies and their efforts to retain customers. However, experts predict that it could take three to five years for the lawsuit to reach a resolution, so we shouldn't expect any immediate outcomes.

Moving on to other news, Microsoft made headlines by acquiring the co-founders of the high-profile AI startup, Inflection AI. Mustafa Suleyman will now lead the consumer-facing unit of Microsoft AI, while Kar√©n Simonyan takes on the role of EVP and CEO of the same group. This acquisition comes after Inflection raised $1.3 billion, with Microsoft being the biggest investor. It's an exciting development for Microsoft's AI ambitions.

Nvidia also made waves with its GTC event. In this wide-ranging developer conference, CEO Jensen Huang surprised attendees with several announcements. He predicted that artificial general intelligence (AGI) is only five years away, which is an ambitious claim. Additionally, Nvidia introduced a new AI platform called GR00T specifically designed for humanoid robots. It's an exciting time for Nvidia and the future of AI.

In other news, Google and Apple are reportedly in talks that could result in Google's AI model being deployed to power upcoming iOS updates. It's unclear whether this is a temporary solution until Apple's own AI efforts are up to speed, the start of a long-term partnership, or a negotiation that may not come to fruition. Nonetheless, it's an interesting development to keep an eye on.

Now let's turn our attention to hacking and privacy concerns. The Biden administration is spearheading an international coalition to combat commercial spyware. Interestingly, some investors joining the coalition were previously involved in the same business they're now fighting against. It's a reminder of the complex nature of the tech industry and the need for vigilance in addressing privacy issues.

In the gaming world, a recent hack disrupted a $5 million tournament for Apex Legends. The hackers claimed it was done for fun but also intended to highlight the exploit used to halt the tournament. It serves as a reminder of the potential vulnerabilities in online gaming platforms and the need for developers to address them.

Glassdoor users have also reported a concerning issue with their profiles. Some users have discovered that their real names were added without their consent, leaving them with no other option but to delete their accounts entirely. It's a reminder to be cautious about the information we share online and the platforms we trust with our personal data.

Shifting gears to funding and IPOs, Reddit's IPO had a strong start. The stock opened at $34 per share and jumped 48% on its first day, closing at $46 after the market closed on Friday. It's an impressive debut for the company.

Astera Labs, a company specializing in connectivity hardware for cloud computing data centers, also had a successful IPO. With the AI boom driving its revenue growth, Astera Labs saw a 45% increase in revenue to $115.8 million last year. Its stock closed at $62.03 on its first day, showcasing the market's confidence in the company.

In other funding news, The Browser Company raised $50 million at a valuation of $550 million. The startup behind the Arc browser has an ambitious vision to supplant PCs with browsers. However, questions about its path to monetization remain unanswered. It will be interesting to see how the company develops in the coming months.

In our bonus round, we explore why AI often struggles with spelling, despite its massive potential. AI-generated images often contain spelling errors, which can be attributed to the limitations of current AI technology. We also discuss Fisker's production pause, which is not due to issues with their electric vehicles but rather a lack of funds. Without additional capital, the company may have to cease operations.

Lastly, we delve into the challenges of reviewing AI systems like ChatGPT or Gemini. While these systems are difficult to review, it's crucial to put them to the test to ensure their reliability and accuracy.

That concludes this edition of Week in Review. Stay tuned for more updates and news in the tech industry.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/apple-antitrust-doj-splash.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-23 20:15:37,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have followed similar growth trajectories, with their core businesses emerging from unexpected opportunities. AWS realized it could sell its internal services, such as storage and compute, while Nvidia discovered that its gaming GPU was well-suited for processing AI workloads. Both companies have experienced explosive revenue growth, with Nvidia's revenue increasing from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024 to $22.1 billion in Q4 2024. However, the majority of this growth came from Nvidia's data center business. 

While AWS has consistently been a major revenue driver for Amazon, its growth has slowed down as competitors like Microsoft and Google entered the market. Similarly, other chip makers are expected to gain market share in the future. Both Nvidia and AWS were in the right place at the right time, as the rise of web apps, mobile, and AI created a demand for their services. 

AWS has become a tremendously profitable business, with a run rate close to $100 billion. However, its growth has started to slow down, while Nvidia's growth continues to soar. The question is whether Nvidia can sustain this growth and become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS. If the GPU market tightens, Nvidia does have other businesses, but they are smaller revenue generators growing at a slower pace than the data center business.

In the short term, Nvidia's revenue growth has been astronomical, and it is expected to continue. The company anticipates $24 billion in revenue for its current quarter, representing a 234% growth compared to the previous year's first quarter. However, as Nvidia's revenue ramp-up slows down, its growth rate is expected to decline. Analysts predict a more modest 8.6% growth rate from the final quarter of fiscal 2024 to the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Despite this, Nvidia is still expected to scale its revenue past the $100 billion annual run rate mark in the next several quarters.

AI could be a significant driver of growth for Nvidia in the coming years, even as competition from AMD, Intel, and other chipmakers increases. Currently, Nvidia holds a dominant position in the market, but it will face stiffer competition in the future. However, it has the advantage of controlling a large portion of the market. When looking at market share at the chip level, Nvidia remains in control. At the board level, AMD is gaining momentum but still lags behind Nvidia.

In conclusion, Nvidia and AWS have experienced significant growth due to their ability to capitalize on emerging technologies. While AWS has slowed down, Nvidia's growth continues, driven by its data center business and the AI market. The future holds challenges as competition increases, but Nvidia has a strong position in the market and the potential for continued growth.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2024/03/25/what-every-ceo-needs-to-know-about-the-new-ai-act/,What Every CEO Needs To Know About The New AI Act,"What Every CEO Needs To Know About The New AI Act

Having recently passed the Artificial Intelligence Act, the European Union is set to enforce some of the most stringent AI regulations in the world. This new legislation aims to protect citizens' rights and freedoms while fostering innovation and entrepreneurship. However, there are several key takeaways that CEOs need to be aware of if their businesses operate in Europe or sell to European consumers.

When Does It Come Into Force?

The Artificial Intelligence Act was adopted by the EU Parliament on March 13 and is expected to become law after being passed by the European Council. While it will take up to 24 months for full enforcement, certain aspects, such as the newly banned practices, could be enforced in as little as six months. This delay allows companies to ensure compliance, as failure to comply could result in significant penalties. Violations of the ""unacceptable uses"" ban could lead to fines of up to 30 million euros or 6% of the company's global turnover, whichever is higher. Additionally, businesses found to be breaking the new laws may suffer reputational damage, as trust is essential in the world of AI.

Some Uses Of AI Will Be Banned

The act emphasizes that AI should be human-centric and serve as a tool to increase human well-being. To achieve this, the EU has prohibited the use of AI for several potentially harmful purposes. These include using AI to influence or change behaviors in harmful ways, biometric classification to infer political or religious beliefs, social scoring systems that could lead to discrimination, and remotely identifying individuals via biometrics in public places. However, there are exemptions for law enforcement organizations to deploy ""unacceptable"" AIs for preventing terrorism and locating missing people, as well as exemptions for scientific study.

While it is encouraging to see that the new laws prioritize limiting the potential harm caused by AI, there is some ambiguity around certain wording, leaving room for interpretation. For example, could the use of AI to target marketing for fast food and high-sugar soft drinks be considered as influencing behaviors in harmful ways? How can we determine whether a social scoring system will lead to discrimination in a world where credit checks and scoring are already common? Further guidance and information on enforcement will be necessary to fully understand the implications of these provisions.

High-Risk AI

In addition to the prohibited uses, the act categorizes AI tools into three levels of risk: high, limited, and minimal. High-risk AI includes self-driving cars and medical applications, and businesses operating in these fields will face stricter rules and greater obligations regarding data quality and protection. Limited and minimal-risk use cases encompass applications such as AI in video games or creative processes like generating text, video, or sounds. While there will be fewer requirements for these categories, transparency and ethical use of intellectual property will still be expected.

Transparency

The act emphasizes the importance of transparency in AI. However, there is some ambiguity regarding the protection of trade secrets and confidential business information. It remains uncertain how these provisions will be interpreted in court cases.

Conclusion

The new AI Act in the European Union introduces strict regulations to protect citizens' rights and well-being while promoting innovation and entrepreneurship. CEOs operating in Europe or selling to European consumers should familiarize themselves with the key takeaways from this legislation. Ensuring compliance and understanding the potential impact on their businesses will be crucial, as violations could result in significant penalties and reputational damage. As AI continues to advance, it is essential to strike a balance between innovation and ethical use to build trust and ensure the benefits of AI are maximized while minimizing potential harms.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660119636c929844c48ce7dd/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 02:28:31,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/24/meet-the-apps-that-tell-you-when-to-take-your-eclipse-glasses-off/,Meet The Apps That Tell You When To Take Your Eclipse Glasses Off,"When to Remove Solar Eclipse Glasses: A Guide for Eclipse Chasers

Experiencing a total solar eclipse is an exhilarating and awe-inspiring event. However, knowing when to remove your solar eclipse glasses can be a cause of confusion and even panic for some. In this guide, we will provide you with the necessary information and tools to ensure you don't miss a moment of this extraordinary celestial phenomenon.

First and foremost, it is crucial to be within the path of totality, which is a narrow strip only 115 miles wide. This path is where the moon's shadow completely covers the sun, allowing you to witness the sun's majestic corona. So, if you want to witness the full splendor of a solar eclipse, you must plan your location accordingly.

Furthermore, a clear sky is essential for optimal viewing. Cloud coverage can obstruct your view and diminish the experience. Therefore, it is recommended to choose a location with a high chance of clear skies during the eclipse.

Now, let's address the burning question: when should you remove your eclipse glasses? The answer is surprisingly simple. You remove your glasses when it gets dark. If you are within the path of totality, you will notice a rapid darkening as the moon's shadow envelops you. This moment is unmistakable, and you won't miss it. However, if you are not within the path of totality, it will not get noticeably dark, and you should continue wearing your glasses throughout the event.

To enhance your eclipse viewing experience, there are now smartphone apps available that offer immersive audio instructions. These apps guide you through the entire eclipse, including when to remove your glasses as totality begins and when to observe specific phenomena. Some of these phenomena include shadow bands, which appear as wavy lines on the ground due to Earth's turbulent atmosphere when the sun is a tiny crescent; Baily's beads, which are the last few drops of sunlight visible before totality; and the diamond ring, which appears as a jewel just before the corona emerges like a halo.

One such app is the ""Pro"" version by The Eclipse Company. This app provides real-time weather updates, cloud forecasts for totality, a countdown timer with a vibration alert to safely remove your glasses, and detailed information about local eclipse events. It also alerts you when to look for specific eclipse phenomena, providing an immersive audio experience.

Another notable app is the Solar Eclipse Timer. Developed by eclipse chaser and educator Gordon Telepun, this app geolocates your position, confirms if you are within or outside the path of totality, and guides you through the contact times. It also provides audio instructions for observing the various eclipse phenomena. It even offers a special ""Photographer's Mode"" developed with the expertise of ex-NASA eclipse calculator and photographer Fred Espenak, also known as ""Mr. Eclipse.""

For iOS users, the One Eclipse app is a fantastic choice. Created by the non-profit organization Astronomers Without Borders and Simulation Curriculum, this app not only allows you to simulate the eclipse from your location or anywhere on Earth but also supports a glasses recycling program for underserved communities worldwide. It features an interactive map with precise eclipse event times and a dynamic Eclipse Countdown clock with a simple audio timer for all the different phases of the eclipse.

In conclusion, witnessing a total solar eclipse is a once-in-a-lifetime experience that should not be missed. By following the instructions outlined in this guide and utilizing the available smartphone apps, you can ensure that you remove your solar eclipse glasses at the right time and fully immerse yourself in the wonder of this celestial spectacle.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/24/samsung-s24-ultra-s23-free-update-warning-for-galaxy-android-users/,Samsung Issues Critical Update For Millions Of Galaxy Users,"If you own a Samsung Galaxy device, there's an important update you need to be aware of and install as soon as possible. Additionally, you should prepare yourself for a significant change that will soon come to your device. Trust me, you don't want to miss out on this.

Samsung has been rolling out its March security update, starting with premium devices and now including more budget models. For example, carrier-unlocked S21 FE devices in the US recently received the update. Over the past two weeks, different variations of S24s, S23s, and S22s received the update first, followed by older and budget variants. It is crucial that you ensure your device downloads and installs this new software as soon as it becomes available for your network and model.

To check if your device is eligible for the monthly update, you can find more information here.

Among the numerous fixes provided in the update, there are two high-risk vulnerabilities that have been patched. These vulnerabilities could potentially allow malware to take control of your device partially or entirely. It is essential to prioritize the installation of this update to protect your device and data.

However, the availability of the March update is not the most significant news of the week. Samsung has finally joined Google's seamless update roadshow after years of avoiding it. Instead of going through the traditional download, install, and reboot cycle for each update, the new system downloads and installs updates in the background onto a secondary partition of the device. The device then reboots from that partition during the next restart, making it the primary partition. The previous partition will remain until the next update, reducing the downtime when the device is not usable.

According to Google, this A/B system update, also known as seamless updates, ensures that a bootable system remains on the disk during an over-the-air update. This reduces the chances of having an inactive device after an update, leading to fewer device replacements and repairs at warranty centers. In the provided image, you can see two progress bars indicating the download/installation and verification of a seamless update. Samsung's Galaxy A55 has been the first device to receive this update, but we can expect it to roll out to more devices in the coming months. We eagerly await news on which devices will be next.

While it remains unclear if this feature will extend to all Samsung models, it's worth noting that Samsung updates are known for their complexity and the need to consult checklists to understand what, when, and for how long. The decision to implement seamless updates might have been prompted by external factors, as a recent Android Open Source Project comment suggested the removal of the legacy alternative after eight years of parallel running. Since seamless updates have been available since 2016, Samsung's delay has been a subject of discussion. On one hand, it has been a source of frustration for the Android project, but on the other hand, Samsung's contribution is vital to the Android ecosystem. We can only speculate on the discussions that have taken place behind the scenes, but one thing is clear: updates will continue to be a mysterious process, and we are yet to learn about the wider approach Samsung will adopt moving forward.

While this new seamless update process may shorten the device's update time to just a minute or two during which it is unusable, it does not necessarily simplify the monthly update process for Samsung and Android devices overall. The combination of Samsung and Android updates across various devices remains a complex task. However, it does eliminate the need for user action. Google recommends scheduling updates during idle maintenance mode, such as overnight and on Wi-Fi, to avoid disrupting users.

Although Samsung's approach still differs from Apple's one-stop-shop update system, we can see that iPhone and Android are becoming more similar in certain aspects. Perhaps, with time, they will move closer to each other.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65b9d23fb7b46f6467a28780/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2366,1280,x313,y135,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 22:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
