Why can't we all be on the same page?
Or better yet, why can't EA make it easier for MUT players and franchise mode fans to coexist?
Madden players fall into three main groups.
There are some smaller categories within these profiles, but they're mostly hardcore Ultimate Team players, online head-to-head players, and devoted franchise mode users.
You'll probably never convince strictly MUT players to try franchise mode, and it's just as hard to do the opposite. However, some aspects of the game are shared by both modes–besides the core gameplay.
The most important and controversial aspect is the availability of legends.
EA has a pretty impressive and appealing list of legends in MUT, but sadly, none of those legends can be used offline or in rosters for franchise mode players.
Roster creators often make historic rosters with their versions of legends like Deion Sanders, Joe Montana, Randy Moss, and Michael Vick (the latest legend shown on the main menu only to be exclusive to MUT).
But those user-made creations are not as good as the ones that are scanned or professionally made by EA's art team.
How accurate can roster creators be when making realistic-looking versions of these legends?
Based on the limited number of template faces available and with no way to shape a created player's face, you're restricted to simply finding a guy with the right skin tone.
Why wouldn't EA follow 2K and Sony San Diego Studio's example and allow every legend that appears in their respective collector modes to be accessible for offline use?
In NBA 2K, every legend in MyTeam is on an All-Time or classic team roster. In MLB The Show, each legend in Diamond Dynasty is on one of the fictional legends' teams or in the free agent pool.
Perhaps even more puzzling, EA’s NHL franchise has the legends from HUT available in their base game.
Madden is the only major American sports video game franchise that keeps its legends locked in its collector mode. The only reasonable explanation for this exclusivity is based on a philosophy that implies making the legends available in the base game would make them less valuable in MUT.
Basically, EA seems to think that keeping Vick and other legends only in MUT will attract players into playing the collector mode–even if they would rather play franchise.
I hope this is not the case, as forcing a consumer's choice has never been my preferred method. It's also a big overreaction.
I've played thousands of hours of collector modes in sports games, and the most powerful concept in these modes is strength.
Users want the strongest cards; by strength, I mean the ones that give them the best chance to win online games against other users.
Whether they are legends or not, those cards are the main factor in grinding, pack buying, and microtransaction spending.
Keeping legends out of the base game isn't positively affecting the bottom line. MUT users who want strength will still go after a good Vick card, even if he's available to offline franchise mode users.
If there is some restriction, it would make more sense for offline users to be able to unlock legends within MUT for use in the base game. Ideally, users could have the option to unlock the legends through gameplay or via purchase.
With this system, wouldn't everyone get what they want? Wouldn't EA still make money from the legends they've paid to sign?
Wouldn't MUT users still have the greatest players in NFL history available as rewards? And wouldn't franchise users have an extra element to add to their virtual football experience?
It makes too much sense not to happen at some point.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6594ff08667811318aadf052/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1863,1048,x0,y110,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-01-03 01:38:30

If you are planning to travel by air in 2024, you might be wondering which airlines are the most reliable and secure. You can find the answer in the latest ranking of the 25 most trustworthy airlines in the world by AirlineRatings.com, a website that reviews the safety and product quality of 385 airlines using a unique seven-star rating system. The website takes into account various factors, such as serious incidents, recent fatal accidents, audits from aviation’s governing and industry bodies, industry-leading safety initiatives, expert pilot training assessment, fleet age and more. However, the website does not include things that are beyond the airlines’ control, such as bird strikes, turbulence injuries, weather diversions and lightning strikes.
In previous years, the website published a list of the top 20 airlines; this year, it increased the list to 25 of the biggest and most well-known carriers. “This year we went for a top 25 because the margins were so small between these airlines,” Geoffrey Thomas, the editor-in-chief of AirlineRatings.com, said in an interview.
The number one spot for 2024 goes to Air New Zealand, which surpassed the competition, setting a new standard in airline safety and operational excellence. Air New Zealand also won in 2022. “Air New Zealand operates in some of the most challenging weather environments which test pilot skills,” says Thomas. “Wellington is one of the most windy airports in the world, while Queenstown is a huge navigation challenge.”
Another feature of Air New Zealand: “The airline has focused on the latest technology and its aircraft are state of the art in that respect,” says Thomas.
The second place on the list belongs to Qantas, which won in 2023—though, according to Thomas, the safety margin was very small between Air New Zealand and Qantas. “Between Air New Zealand and Qantas there is only 1.5 points—it’s incredibly close,” says Thomas.
What pulled Qantas down: “Qantas slipped on fleet age, which the airline will address in 2024 with new fleets arriving,” says Thomas.
International carriers dominate the list of safest airlines. When it comes to U.S. carriers, only one is on the top 10 list: Alaska Airlines, which comes in number 10. (The airline slipped two points from 2023, when it ranked number eight). Hawaiian Airlines ranks number 21—a big drop from 2023 when it was number 12. American Airlines ranks number 22 (down from number 19 in 2023) and United Airlines ranks number 25 (down from number 14 in 2023).
“The U.S. carriers rankings are dragged down by the fleet age of their aircraft, however all have major replacement programs in place but it will take time for that to reflect in the rankings,” says Thomas.
And as he points out: “The rankings of all airlines include incidents against flights and fleet age. However the scoring was very tight.”
When it comes to the low-cost carriers, Jetstar—an Australian airline owned by Qantas—comes in number one. The top-ranking low-cost U.S. carrier is Frontier, which ranks number six beating out Southwest (at number nine), Sun Country (at number 14) and Spirit (number 15) and JetBlue (number 17).

Interestingly, the teaser does not focus on the Galaxy S24, S24+ or S24 Ultra smartphones, which are widely anticipated to be revealed at the event. Samsung has confirmed that the Galaxy S Series will be part of the show, but the main attraction seems to be Galaxy AI. Samsung has previously introduced Samsung Gauss, an AI platform with three main components; ""Gauss Language for comprehending human language and generating natural responses, Gauss Code helps software development for code explanations and creating test cases, and Gauss Image enables the creation of and the alteration of images.""
Galaxy AI is coming, according to Samsung's promise.
The Galaxy S devices are a vital part of the offering, with the press release stating that “[Samsung will] reveal the latest premium Galaxy innovations, providing a new mobile experience powered by AI. ""
The new devices will run on Samsung's latest Exynos 2400 chipset or a customized Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 made for the Galaxy S24 platform, depending on the region. The Samsung fans will be eager to see if the Exynos devices can finally match the performance and efficiency of the Qualcomm-powered option. Both chipsets are designed to optimize AI and ML tasks running on a device or working with cloud-based services.
The Galaxy S24 Ultra is also expected to come with a new S-Pen stylus and feature a titanium frame to increase durability while reducing the overall weight of the flagship.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnarcher/2024/01/02/lg-reveals-2024-oled-tv-range/,LG Reveals 2024 OLED TV Range,"Here is a possible rewritten version of the article:

One of the most awaited AV events every year is when LG reveals its new OLED TV lineup. This year, we get to see it earlier than usual, before the 2024 CES in Las Vegas next week. And while LG’s new OLED range may not be as groundbreaking as last year’s G3 series, there are still plenty of exciting features for AV enthusiasts to enjoy.
Last year’s LG G3 models introduced a major improvement for WRGB technology with their Micro Lens Array technology (part of LG’s Brightness Booster Max technology, which combines the MLA hardware with other factors that make LG’s premium OLED picture quality stand out). So let’s start with LG’s new G4 range.
LG's new G4 series will build on the Brightness Booster Max technology introduced on last year's G3 ... [+] range with an ultra-powerful new processor. There's a new matching soundbar for the G4s, too. Photo: LG
The main picture enhancement here comes from a new processor that LG says is so much better than its predecessor that they’ve named it Alpha 11 AI instead of the expected Alpha 10 engine that would have followed 2023’s Alpha 9 processor. To give you some numbers to back up the Alpha 11 AI hype, LG claims the new chip will offer four times the AI performance of its predecessor, 1.7x the graphics performance, and 1.3x the general processing power - all paired with 2.5GB of RAM.
The most important news about Alpha 11 is that LG’s AI Picture Pro deep learning-powered image enhancement system can now work with all sources, including those connected to the TV via HDMI, instead of only working with broadcasts and some streaming services as it did before.
The new AI Picture Pro system includes the latest versions of the genre and scene analysis, AI Super Resolution, Noise Reduction and OLED Dynamic Tone Mapping Pro engine features (the latter of which divides the image into thousands of analysis blocks to make its tone mapping more effective) that we’ve seen in AI Picture Pro before. But Alpha 11 also adds two potentially key new AI Picture Pro features: Object Enhancing By Visual Perception, and AI Director Processing.
The Object Enhancing By Visual Perception feature is said to analyze each pixel in the picture to better detect and more effectively treat different objects in an image to make it more realistic (for instance, by giving more emphasis to key objects). The AI Director Processing tries to apply to whatever you’re watching the colour theory (where colour is used to enhance emotions) used during content mastering and grading to give images more impact.
These two new features might sound problematic for AV purists who would rather their TV just show the images it’s receiving as accurately as possible. However, given the power and extent of the AI deep learning that’s behind these features, I think they’re probably worth at least trying out, even for die-hard cinephiles.
The Alpha 11 processor also introduces a couple of potentially critical new elements to the G4’s AI Sound Pro system: A virtual 11.1.2-channel upmixer that can even be applied to stereo sources, and a new Voice Remastering system that can use AI to extract voices from audio mixes so that their clarity can be enhanced without affecting the rest of the mix. These new features join previous AI Sound Pro features of Adaptive Sound Control (which optimizes sound playback in real time based on analysis of the content), AI Acoustic Tuning to optimise the sound for your room set up, and a Dynamic Sound Booster for making the sound more dynamic and powerful.
LG's flagship OLED range for 2024 will be the wireless M4s. Photo: LG
While it’s not clear if LG has made any significant improvements to the hardware side of the Micro Lens Array system that helped the G3s deliver such a huge increase in brightness last year, LG does say that its latest Brightness Booster Max technology, which also includes a light boosting algorithm along with the better ‘light control architecture’, will make the G4s even brighter than the G3s. It’s not absolutely clear by how much; LG just says that the G4s will be up to 70% brighter than ‘conventional’ (which means basic entry level models such as LG’sB series) OLED screens.
One other great bit of progress for the G4 range is that the Brightness Booster Max system extends to the 83-inch model; it’s no longer limited to the 55, 65 and 77-inch sizes in the range. The only G4 model that won’t benefit from Brightness Booster Max technology is the new king-sized 97 incher.
Gamers have a new feature to look forward to, too, in the form of support for 144Hz games if you have a PC capable of delivering such refresh rates. LG says that this feature makes its new ‘",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6594b0c1b0a4ee92159accbe/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-01-02 20:00:46

Updated January 2: article originally posted January 1
Samsung will launch three new Galaxy S24 smartphones later this month, and those who pre-order one of its flagship phones will get some amazing free offers.

Samsung is expected to hold a Galaxy Unpacked event on January 17th, where the Galaxy S24, Galaxy S24+ and Galaxy S24 Ultra will be unveiled. The phones should be available for sale in key markets before the month ends, but there will be a pre-order window with several free offers to boost sales.
Update: Tuesday, January 2. Samsung has now confirmed the next Galaxy Unpacked event, where it will unveil the Galaxy S24, S24+ and S24 Ultra. In addition to confirming the time of 10 am Pacific on January 17th at the SAP Center in San Jose, CA, Samsung announced a special offer for those reserving a phone before the launch… a pre-order before a pre-order, so to speak.
Similar to a previous offer from the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Z Flip 5 launch, customers who reserve a phone between the 2nd and 16th of January will receive a $50 credit towards buying a phone from the S24 range.
The details of the pre-order offers are not yet known; they will probably be revealed during the launch event, but recent reports suggest two options will come back to attract consumers to the new Galaxy flagships.

The first is “double your storage,” which will allow consumers to get the next model’s storage for no extra cost—if you buy the 128 GB model of the Galaxy S24 you’ll get the 256 GB model right through the range to those buying the 512 GB model of the Galaxy S24 Ultra getting the 1TB model. You can see it as a double your memory or a lower price on the models with more storage; either way, it's a tempting option for those on a budget.
Then you have the bonus accessories. Samsung is expected to offer every Galaxy S24 buyer a discount on the Galaxy Buds Fan Edition wireless buds and Galaxy Watch smartwatches. The latest Buds FE were released late last year alongside the Galaxy S23 FE smartphone, offering active noise cancellation and a transparency mode for $99. The Galaxy Watch 6 was released in the summer of 2023 with better battery life, thinner bezels, and WearOS 4 for $299.
It remains to be seen which peripherals will be offered with which phones and how much discount will be offered. For comparison, Google offered a free pair of Pixel Buds Pro for those pre-ordering the Pixel 8 smartphone and a free Pixel Watch 2 for those pre-ordering the Pixel 8 Pro.
Finally, you have the exclusive models available only through Samsung’s website.
Samsung will have a wide range of colors across the S24 portfolio, but some will only be available through the website. Those looking for the highest specced Galaxy S24 Ultra must order through Samsung’s website if, as expected, the 1 TB storage option will only be available online.
Recent leaks on the potential European pricing suggest that the Galaxy S24 and S24+ will be slightly cheaper than equivalent S23 models. At the same time, the Galaxy S24 Ultra will be more expensive than last year’s Galaxy S23 Ultra.

The popular iFixit website has several official spare parts, with pages for the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro parts ready. The screen is the ‘big ticket’ item that many will look for first.

You can buy these individually or as part of a fix kit, which has the necessary tools to replace the part, such as suction handles, pry tools, cleaning cloths, and 4mm bits.
Some parts are not accessible. The main circuit board, which includes the USB-C port, is not available for purchase. This might be a letdown, but it should not overshadow the positive benefits of offering official parts and repair guides. Pixel owners have a supply of parts available for the same seven years as the software updates. Google is showing the benefits of an open repair program to the rest of the smartphone industry.

AI seems to have gained the trust of many Americans for their healthcare needs. getty
People are not waiting for the medical experts to endorse AI for health. They are already using ChatGPT to get health advice, diagnoses, and explanations of what their doctors tell them. A new survey of 2,000 American adults shows that 52% of them have used an AI system like ChatGPT to check their symptoms. Most of them say that ChatGPT was right.
“More than half of the respondents (52%) said they have given their symptoms to a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT, looking for a diagnosis,” says UserTesting, the company that conducted the survey. “Of them, 81% have received a diagnosis from the LLM, and when they asked their doctor for their diagnosis, 84% said it was accurate.”
Americans seem more willing to trust AI than others.
While nearly half of British people and a third of Australians say they don’t trust AI for any health-related tasks, only 6% of Americans feel the same. Some of the tasks we’d trust AI to do are simple, like booking appointments or working with pharmacies, but 53% of us “would trust AI to suggest treatment plans.”
I have used AI myself to understand medical terms and a medical diagnosis after getting a full-body MRI. And I recently used ChatGPT to confirm that I probably had a flu over the holidays.
It’s not surprising that Americans are looking for healthcare solutions outside of the usual doctor-patient and hospital settings. 26 million don’t have health insurance, and even those who do may face high co-pays or difficulty getting an appointment. Also, many rural and inner city areas in the United States may not have local and convenient healthcare options regardless of your insurance status.
“As the country ages, AI will be part of the healthcare journey to provide care at the scale that we need, especially in areas where there is a lack of access or healthcare deserts,” says Lija Hogan, who leads research strategy at UserTesting.
What would we trust AI with?
Suggesting treatment plans: 53% Tracking sleeping patterns: 53% Making doctors appointments: 52% Tracking heart health: 51% Diagnosing chronic illnesses like heart disease: 48% Working with pharmacies to fill prescriptions: 47% Tracking blood pressure: 42% Diagnosing Covid: 42% Providing fertility information: 40% Diagnosing colds and flus: 40%
Of course, many of us already have devices and tools that do some of this: Apple Watches, Fitbits, or others. And 78% say that we believe AI and tech companies will protect our health data that we share with them.
However, when we’re really sick, we may need a doctor and specific medical tests for diseases that can only be detected with blood tests or other exams that consumer-grade wearable medical technology can’t do. Consumer tech may be coming for that too—see the COR ‘FitBit for your blood’ that I covered in March of 2022—but there are some things only doctors can do. Few of us have a personal MRI machine, or X-ray.
The best option may be doctors and AI working together: a constant source of health information delivered easily via wearable tech and smart AI, and a backup layer of defense provided by experts who use all the data and insights that smart systems can offer.
“How AI can play the best role in healthcare journey is something that doctors and patients need to figure out together,” says Hogan. “This means that we have to figure out how to ensure people are getting quality advice in the right contexts and how to connect patients to providers.”
That connected, seamless system of medical professionals and healthcare-trained AIs, however, is still not available.

Welcome to the first Wordle Wednesday of 2024! I hope you all had a fantastic holiday break, a wonderful Christmas and a very, very happy New Year’s! I have a positive feeling about this year. 2023 was not very good for me, but I think I ended it well, and so I enter the new year with some hope for the future. Not too much, of course, but some.
Hope is the spark of rebellion.
In any case, it’s Wednesday and that means it’s time to solve a riddle, brain teaser or logic puzzle. Here’s today’s:
A farmer sends his daughter on a small boat across the river to the market with a pouch of coins. She buys a scruffy dog, a chicken and a bag of corn with her coins. When she returns to her small boat, she realizes that it is so small that she’ll only be able to carry one of her three purchases across at a time. She faces a problem, however: If she leaves the chicken with the corn, the chicken will eat the corn. If she leaves the scruffy dog with the chicken, the scruffy dog will eat the chicken. How does she get all three items across without any of them becoming a meal?
If you solve this puzzle, let me know on Twitter or Facebook. I’ll post the answer here on my blog (be sure to follow!) in tomorrow’s Wordle Guide.

Can you solve today’s phrase? Play Now
I had a bit of fun with how my own guesses went down today. I was thinking about guilt because someone sent me an angry message about my coverage of the Jonathan Majors case, and one of the only words left that I could think of after that was trial. How ironic! I obviously had to use that for my second guess—and oh how sweet it would have been if that had been today’s Wordle!—but came back with three greens and one yellow ‘R’.
At this point, the answer was clear: twirl for the win. Hooray!
Today’s Competitive Wordle Score
Once again, I get 1 point for guessing in three and 0 for tying the Bot. I’ll take it!
Today’s Wordle Etymology
The word ""twirl"" comes from the Middle English ""twirlen"" or ""twirlig"", which in turn comes from the Old English ""thwirl,"" meaning ""to turn around."" This Old English root is related to the Old Norse ""þvarr,"" meaning ""stubborn,"" suggesting a sense of something being twisted or turned with force.
The development of ""twirl"" reflects a common pattern in English etymology where words evolve through gradual phonetic and semantic changes over time, often influenced by the languages of neighboring cultures and invading forces, like the Norse in the case of Old English. This word especially captures the action of turning or spinning something in a light, quick manner, which is consistent with its etymological roots in the idea of turning or twisting.

Annotated screenshot for the crypto fraud that's spreading on X featuring an AI impersonation of Ripple's CEO, Brad ... [+] Garlinghouse. X
If you have been watching ads for a “giveaway” of the digital currency XRP on platforms like YouTube and X in the last few months, you might have seen Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse explaining how people can get XRP for free if they just send some XRP to a specific crypto wallet first. But it’s all a hoax using artificial intelligence to make it seem like Garlinghouse is saying things he never actually said.
I first spotted the hoax ads on YouTube back in November, which is surprising because the social media platform has a number of measures in place to prevent obvious hoaxes. But lately I’ve been seeing the ad so much on X, formerly known as Twitter, that it’s seemingly taking up half of the ads in my feed.
The ads seem to use AI to make it look like Garlinghouse is saying things he didn’t say. And it’s somewhat convincing until you really look at his mouth and notice the lip movements don’t quite match what he’s saying.
Garlinghouse himself confirmed back in November that the ads are hoaxes.
“There’s been an uptick in deepfake hoax videos (ex below) overlaying new words with old video footage from Ripple’s events (@YouTube are you asleep at the wheel again?!). Reminder: don't trust, verify (all approved messaging will only come from official Ripple accounts),” Garlinghouse tweeted on November 16, 2023.
New technologies that allow anyone to mimic someone’s voice and create a video that makes it look like they’re saying things they never said have advanced in recent years. And plenty of people are getting fooled by the ads, as you can see from testimonials of people who said they lost money on X.
“I just got fooled 2k in xrp on an ad here on X. Saying they would double it back to me. I should have looked it up....” one user wrote on X.
X has struggled in the past with hoax cryptocurrency ads, including some that even use photos of X owner Elon Musk. And it’s not clear when the company will take crypto hoaxes seriously, since they’ve become such a big problem.
X did not immediately respond to questions emailed Tuesday about why hoax ads for free Ripple seem to have increased recently. I’ll update this post if I hear back. But for now, just know that anyone who’s promising to send you digital currency if you just send them some crypto first, is almost certainly operating a hoax.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65949b5aea75550602c919da/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-01-02 18:29:52

A proptech startup has faced difficulties.
Frontdesk, a startup that operated more than 1,000 furnished apartments across the United States, let go of its entire 200-person workforce Tuesday after failing to secure more funding, TechCrunch learned exclusively from sources close to the company. The mass layoff happened just seven months after the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based startup bought smaller competitor Zencity.
The layoffs, which affected full-time, part-time workers and contractors, took place Tuesday afternoon during “a two-minute Google Meet call,” according to one employee who was among those joining the online meeting.
During that call, Frontdesk CEO Jesse DePinto told employees that Frontdesk would be filing for a state receivership, an alternative to bankruptcy, the sources said.
The company has not replied to a request for comment. When dialing the number on the company’s website, a recording says: “Currently, Frontdesk is unavailable. If you have a reservation, please seek alternative accommodations and expect to be contacted within the next two weeks.” TechCrunch will update the article if the company replies.
Frontdesk, which was founded in 2017, had raised about $26 million from investors such as JetBlue Ventures, Veritas Investments and Sand Hill Angels, according to Crunchbase.
Frontdesk tried to raise a bridge round, pitching investors on a new plan of doing full building management, sources told TechCrunch. That strategy didn’t work out and the company couldn’t keep operating. Frontdesk was apparently still hopeful about its ability to raise more capital; the startup had posted on LinkedIn openings for several jobs, including a chief of staff role, just two months ago.
The startup’s business model, which is renting apartments at market rental rates and furnishing them for short-term rentals in more than 30 markets, has faced challenges mainly due to the upfront costs involved, associated capital expenditures and variables in demand and rates, one of the sources said.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/former-anthemis-partner-soft-launches-new-fintech-focused-venture-firm/,Former Anthemis partner soft-launches new fintech-focused venture firm,"Here is a possible rewritten version of the article:

After nearly seven years as a partner at Anthemis Group, Ruth Foxe Blader has decided to launch her own venture firm, Foxe Capital, TechCrunch learned exclusively today.
Blader is accompanied by Kyle Perez, a former investment associate at Anthemis. Sophie Winwood is also joining as an operating partner. Winwood and Blader previously co-founded WVC:E, an organization that aims to foster “inclusion, empowerment and integration of VC globally.”
Blader says she has led investments in more than 50 fintech startups over the years, including Lemonade, Branch, Elevate, Flock, Mesh and Amplify.
Blader told TechCrunch in an interview that the main reason behind her departure from London-based Anthemis was her aspiration to invest independently. The investor says she experienced what that was like after she and Winwood started WVC:E in April 2022.
Foxe Capital will keep investing on behalf of Anthemis, acting as a sub advisor for the firm, and essentially managing the vehicle she was hired to run in 2017. When all that capital has been deployed — Blader estimates that it will stop writing checks into startups this year out of the Anthemis funds — Foxe Capital will focus on fundraising. Meanwhile, Foxe Capital is being compensated for continuing to run the fund on behalf of Anthemis, according to Blader.
Anthemis still has an economic interest in that vehicle but does not own any part of the management company and will only have a continued economic interest in Foxe Capital if it chooses to be an LP when the firm fundraises in the future, according to Blader.
An Anthemis spokesperson confirmed the move, sharing via email: “Ruth wanted to be an independent manager. Anthemis proudly backs her. She will continue to support us as an investor across her current Anthemis funds.”
While Blader travels back and forth currently between France and New York (Blader has been living in Europe/New York for 15 years), Foxe Capital is based in New York City. Its investments will be global, with the U.S. as its home market.
“We have the most familiarity [outside of the U.S.] with Europe but have also done investments in India, Cameroon and LatAm,” she told TechCrunch. “We’ll be looking to invest opportunistically globally.”
Restructuring and a failed SPAC
Anthemis has had its share of turmoil — and turnover — in recent times.
Last April, TechCrunch broke the news that Anthemis Group had completed a restructuring that resulted in its letting go of 16 employees, or about 28% of its staff.
A spokesperson for London-based Anthemis at the time said the move was an effort “to better reflect current market conditions and to set up the business for future growth” against its “strategic priorities.”
Also, last May, TechCrunch reported that Anthemis Group was trying to raise $200 million for a third fund. It had been in the market since 2022 and had only secured commitments of just $36.4 million. The firm separately had to scrap plans to raise a SPAC in late April.
In the past 18 months, Anthemis also saw a couple of portfolio companies stumble. In November 2022, controversy surrounding the sudden stepping down of three of Pipe’s co-founders, including its CEO, raised eyebrows. And in 2023, LGBTQ+-focused digital bank Daylight was slammed with a lawsuit by three former employees “alleging age and wage discrimination, whistleblower retaliation, and fraud.” The startup shut down later in the year.
The firm’s 2023 restructuring was not the first time it saw a management shakeup. Anthemis also made headlines in 2018 when its then-CEO and co-founder Nadeem Shaikh resigned after reportedly being the target of a sexual harassment complaint by a female employee.
Blader is not the first fintech-focused investor to venture out on her own in recent times.
Early last year, Peter Ackerson left fintech-focused Fin Capital to co-found a new firm, Audere Capital. It is still unclear as to whether Ackerson left voluntarily or was forced to leave. A source with familiarity of internal happenings at Fin Capital alleged there was tension between Ackerson and managing partner and founder Logan Allin around portfolio company alternative financing startup Pipe — an investment into which Ackerson led and on whose board he sat. Audere has invested in five startups, according to PitchBook — only one of which is focused on financial services.

Samsung has been skipping the big show reveals for its mobile division for some time. The company also seems to have abandoned the tradition of saving its first major phone announcement of the year for the weeks before Mobile World Congress.
The next Unpacked event will take place on January 17 — just over a week after CES ends. If history repeats itself (as it usually does), we’ll get to see Samsung’s new mobile flagship, the Galaxy S24, for the first time.
The previous event, which happened in early February last year, introduced three main variants of the S23, along with a few Galaxy Book laptops. As usual with Samsung, the handset leaks have been happening for a while now.
Images of the S24, S24+ and the S24 Ultra show that they don’t differ much from their predecessors. The devices are expected to have 6.2-, 6.7- and 6.8-inch screens, respectively. The S24 and S24+ seem to have three rear cameras each, while the Ultra adds a fourth one, including the 200-megapixel sensor.
The Ultra also keeps most of the features it inherited from the Galaxy Note series, such as square edges and S Pen functionality. The ultra-premium model is also rumored to have a titanium option, similar to the iPhone 15 Pro Max before it.
Despite apparently being among the first to use Qualcomm’s more powerful and energy-efficient Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip, leaked price lists suggest a lower price point in Europe, which could be good news for potential buyers everywhere.
This time, the event will be held in the South Bay. It starts at 10 a.m. PT and you can watch it here. If you want to reserve the device without seeing it before January 16, Samsung will give you a $50 “reserve credit” on preorders.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/CMC_6058.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-01-02 23:00:02
https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/tech-for-palestine-launches-to-provide-tools-and-projects-to-help-advocate-for-palestinians/,Tech for Palestine launches to provide tools to help support Palestinians,"Here is a possible rewritten version of the article:

A group of over 40 tech professionals, including founders, investors, engineers and others, are launching a coalition called Tech for Palestine today. The goal of the coalition is to create open source projects, tools and data that can help others in the tech industry support the Palestinian cause.
The group is starting at a critical time in the region. The attack by Hamas on Israel on October 7th resulted in more than 1,100 deaths. The subsequent war in the Gaza Strip has caused millions of Palestinians to lose their homes and tens of thousands to lose their lives.
The tech industry has been divided over the Israel-Hamas war. Israel, which has a thriving tech and startup scene, has received strong backing from many tech individuals and organizations. On the other hand, those who have called for a ceasefire and expressed solidarity with Palestine have faced some backlash and job losses.
Paul Biggar, the founder of Tech for Palestine, wants to increase awareness of the situation in Gaza, advocate for a lasting ceasefire and offer ways for those who are afraid to speak out publicly in favor of Palestine to still show their support. It is one of the first tech initiatives to take a public stand for Palestine and could signal a change in the venture industry’s attitude towards the Israel-Hamas conflict as more people seek to voice their support for a ceasefire.
Biggar, who also founded the company CircleCI — which was valued at $1.7 billion last time — formed the coalition after publishing a popular blog post that criticized the tech industry’s silence on the plight of Palestinians. He said that after he published his blog post, he received thousands of messages of support from people who were scared to speak up themselves for fear of harming their careers.
He said that among them were “dozens of people who not only spoke up but who had started projects to change the industry to make sure that people speaking up for Palestine could be heard. Dozens more were volunteering to help,” Biggar added. “I started connecting these folks together, and the [Tech for Palestine] community came together very quickly.”
The platform, which is still in its early stages, will host projects run by small groups and serve as a place to share resources and advice, something that many pro-Palestinian tech workers are already doing privately. It has already attracted names like Idris Mokhtarzada, founder of the unicorn Truebill, to help build out the platform. So far, it has created a badge for engineers to use on GitHub that calls for a ceasefire and created HTML snippets for people to use on their websites to put up a support ceasefire banner.
Biggar said there are plans to eventually collaborate more with Palestinian organizations and help Palestinian startups with mentorship and cloud credits. TechCrunch previously reported that the war has destroyed much of Palestine’s emerging tech industry.
Arfah Farooq, founder of Muslamic Makers, said the last three months have changed everyone in many ways. At the same time, there has been a unity and activism that she has never seen before. “I’ve seen firsthand people come together to work for Palestine with nothing but their laptops from across the globe,” she said.
She decided to work with Tech for Palestine after reading Biggar’s viral blog post and has already started to share resources on how to support Palestine. “Due to the siege, we can’t go to Gaza and help on the ground, but we help regardless of where we are in the world,” Farooq said.
One engineer, who asked to remain anonymous, decided to join the coalition because this person felt trapped at work. This person has agreed to work as an engineer and product manager to help build resources for Tech for Palestine, saying, “I hope this initiative will spark a significant shift and give people their voices back.”
A former tech brand marketer, who is also afraid to speak out publicly for fear it will affect a new job search, also told TechCrunch about feeling happy to have a way to get involved with the cause.
“This period has been incredibly isolating to Arabs, Muslims and other people of color in VC and tech,” she said. “Tech for Palestine is a necessary initiative. When we are seeing mobilization around the world and the U.S. in the numbers of hundreds of thousands calling for peace and [the] humanization of the Palestinians, the tech community can no longer be silent.”
The Tech for Palestine initiative comes as the death toll among Palestinians continues to rise. In recent weeks, U.S. officials have reportedly urged Israel to do more to protect civilians in Gaza even as they have reaffirmed U.S. support for Israeli security.
Biggar hopes, at the very least, that this new coalition will lead to more people speaking up.
“The narrative has only just turned,” he said. “We are working to enable many more who feel silenced to speak out, we are only getting started.”","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1367359752.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-01-02 21:15:40

Terran Orbital has revised its expected financial results for the end of the year after getting a long-awaited payment from its biggest customer, Rivada Space Networks.
The company confirmed the news today, which follows earlier reports from TechCrunch that Terran CEO Marc Bell was anticipating at least some payment from Rivada before the year ended.
Rivada, a German subsidiary of U.S.-based Rivada Networks, has big plans to launch a megaconstellation in low Earth orbit. The company hired Terran to build 300 satellites at a total estimated cost of $2.4 billion. The contract is Terran’s largest by far, making up most of the company’s backlog.
Terran did not reveal the exact payment amount, but the company said that Rivada has paid all outstanding invoices. Terran also said that it expects to get more payments this year and that it is on schedule to deliver satellites in 2025 and 2026.
Because of the payment, Terran changed its expected year-end cash balance from $38.7 million as of the end of September to more than $70 million by the end of December. It’s great news for Terran Orbital, which has seen its stock plummet since going public at $10.96 per share. But a payment from its biggest customer will surely boost investor confidence as the company enters a new year.
Terran Orbital, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol LLAP, saw a small increase in its stock price from the news, going from $1.14 as of previous close to $1.26 as of publication time.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1474001528.jpg?resize=1200,781",2024-01-02 21:09:48

Puma is one of the few brands that stuck with web3 in 2023, despite the prolonged crypto slump. Ivan Dashkov, the head of emerging technology at Puma, told TechCrunch+ that the company is committed to web3 for the long term.
Puma has been working with web3 for two years, but its tech revenues are still small. However, the sportswear maker wants to be prepared for a future where crypto is more mainstream. “Web3 is a big shift in how people use the internet,” Dashkov said. He added that such changes can have a huge impact on brands, and Puma does not want to miss out.
Dashkov admitted that the company “missed the boat” on the previous e-commerce and social media trends that reshaped the internet in the last few decades. That’s why it wants to be ahead of the curve in this space. “We don’t think the way the space exists today will be what it looks like in four or five years, but we want to be ready.”
In February 2022, Puma secured its first Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domain, as Puma.eth. ENS domains are popular among Ethereum users who want to have easy-to-remember addresses, instead of using a long and random string of letters and numbers.
In June 2023, Puma introduced Black Station and Black Station 2, which its website calls “experimental 3D spatial playground,” which is essentially a metaverse. I tried out the entry page and found it to be somewhat slow and unclear (disclaimer: I’m not a big gamer, so maybe I’m not getting it, but I guess not all Puma fans are either.) Anyway, its metaverse aims to provide consumers with a different way to interact with the brand, Dashkov said.

The news that AI giant OpenAI and Axel Springer had formed a financial and strategic partnership last year seemed to signal a peaceful coexistence between people who produce words, and tech companies that use them to develop and train artificial intelligence models. OpenAI had also reached a similar deal with the AP, for context.
But the harmony was disrupted when the New York Times filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and its supporter Microsoft, claiming that the AI company’s generative AI models were “created by copying and exploiting millions of The Times’s protected news articles, in-depth investigations, opinion pieces, reviews, how-to guides, and more.” The Times argued that OpenAI’s “can generate output that repeats Times content word for word, summarizes it closely, and imitates its expressive style, as shown by dozens of examples.”
The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.
The Times stated in its lawsuit that it “protested after it found out that Defendants were using Times content without authorization to build their models and tools,” and that “negotiations have not resulted in a resolution” with OpenAI.
The question of how to respect copyright and ensure that AI development doesn’t stop will not be solved easily. But the deals and more contentious disputes between creators and the AI companies that want to consume and use their work to create artificial intelligence models create a tense situation for both parties. Tech companies are busy integrating new generative AI models trained on data that includes protected material into their software products; Microsoft is a pioneer in that area, it’s worth noting. And media companies that have invested heavily over time to create a collection of reported and other materials are outraged that their efforts are being absorbed into machines that give nothing back to the people who provided their training data.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/steamboat-willie-mickey-mouse-public-domain/,Public domain Mickey Mouse is the first meme of 2024,"Here is a possible rewrite of the article:

The start of 2024 brings a special occasion for nerds everywhere: Public Domain Day. This year, the celebration is extra remarkable. After decades of legal battles, “Steamboat Willie,” a 1928 Walt Disney short featuring Mickey Mouse, is now public domain.
That doesn’t mean that you can do anything you want with the character of Mickey Mouse as we know him today. But, Mickey Mouse as he appears in the “Steamboat Willie” animation? That’s public domain, baby.
Every January 1, a bunch of old works of literature, music and art enter the public domain, meaning that no one holds exclusive rights to the work anymore. Some works are created to be public domain from the start, but previously copyrighted works become public domain because the copyright can expire over time. Copyright law differs from country to country, but to put it simply, the concept of the public domain is why there’s a Winnie the Pooh slasher film (which has a 3% rating on Rotten Tomatoes…), or a queer “Great Gatsby” retelling.
Already, there have been multiple horror movie and video game adaptations announced that will feature the version of Mickey Mouse from “Steamboat Willie.” Generally, “because I can” is not an inspiration that generates great art (see, again, the Rotten Tomatoes rating on “Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey”), but these are the situations in which life imitates a YouTube comments section: everyone wants to be “first.”
Mickey Mouse has already been remixed in certain media, like the TV show South Park, which created an egomaniacal Mr. Mouse character who is obsessed with owning everything. Mr. Mouse is an obvious rip off of Mickey, but depictions like this can be protected under a different subset of copyright law. Under fair use doctrine, some behaviors that might seem like copyright violations are legally permissible if they are transformative or satirical in nature (but of course, these are subjective parameters, which is a whole other can of legal worms).
Any notable work that enters the public domain will garner attention. But part of why there is such an excess of surprise “Steamboat Willie” adaptations is because Disney worked so hard to prevent this day from ever arriving.
The next 5 years of Steamboat Willie content pic.twitter.com/SoBanKpslO — ToonHoleChris (@toonholechris) January 1, 2024
“Steamboat Willie” was slated to enter the public domain in 1984, but Disney managed to extend that copyright for 40 more years through extensive government lobbying for two different copyright extension acts. First, Disney pushed for Congress to pass the Copyright Act of 1976, which delayed “Steamboat Willie” and Mickey Mouse’s public domain debut until 2004. By the 1990s, Disney continued to lobby for further extensions, which gave us the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998, making “Steamboat Willie” safe until just a few days ago.
“Many people thought that Disney would keep up this fight. But I personally don’t find it that surprising that this day has finally come,” wrote Casey Fiesler, an associate professor of information science at CU Boulder. “It was inevitable. And it would have been both a hard fight and a PR nightmare to postpone this yet again.”
Some of Disney’s most iconic works were adapted from public domain stories, like “The Little Mermaid” by Hans Christian Andersen, or the Brothers Grimm’s stories about Cinderella and Rapunzel. So, critics of Disney found its extensive lobbying for copyright extension to be hypocritical, with some even referring to the 1998 law as the “Mickey Mouse Protection Act.”
On social media, avid meme-makers derive joy from the humiliation of large corporations. It’s like a David vs. Goliath situation, in which random posters want to feel as though they, random people on the internet, can actually stand up to untouchable corporations. The internet delighted to watch as someone abused Twitter’s botched blue check system to impersonate pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and declare that insulin was free. It’s like when the Bernie Sanders mittens meme went viral, and even an Amazon corporate Twitter account posted its own Bernie meme. And when users responded by pointing out that Sanders is one of Amazon’s most vocal critics, the meme was quickly deleted.
So, the version of Mickey Mouse from “Steamboat Willie” seems to be everywhere right now. Among crypto folk, some people are already making “Steamboat Willie” NFTs, which is a good idea that definitely won’t result in any scammy behavior. And among the nihilistic meme-makers, we’re seeing AI-generated images of Mickey Mouse doing 9/11, Mickey Mouse confessing to the murder of JFK and many more extreme representations of Mickey that we do not dare repeat","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-01-02-at-9.58.27 AM.png?resize=1200,809",2024-01-02 18:16:15

A new update from Telegram brings better calls with a redesigned interface that consumes less battery power. The update also adds new animations, new features for the app’s bot platform and more.
The company says it has revamped calls and added backgrounds that change according to the call’s status: ringing, active or ended. The new design uses fewer resources than before, which means it extends battery life and works well on older devices. The update also enhances call quality. Telegram says it will launch more enhancements to connection and audio quality in 2024.
Telegram is also rolling out updates to its bot platform, which allows developers to integrate services into the Telegram ecosystem. Bots can now respond to messages and manage reactions, quotes and links, send replies to other chats or topics, and more. Bots can also access information about giveaways and boosts in channels where they are admins.
Moreover, Telegram is bringing its vaporize animation to both iOS and Android users after previously testing it with select users. The new effect plays when you delete a message, and is meant to bring some fun to the app.
The launch of the new features comes a month after Telegram announced improvements to channels, emoji customization for reactions and stats for stories to compete better with WhatsApp, which launched its broadcast channels features to all users in September 2023. Although Telegram has had channels for a long time now, the app has to keep innovating in order to compete with WhatsApp.
Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently said in his broadcast channel in WhatsApp that the channels feature had reached 500 million monthly active users. For comparison, WhatsApp has more than 2 billion monthly active users and Telegram has over 800 million monthly active users.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GettyImages-503572806.jpg?resize=1200,854",2024-01-02 17:29:52

A new capsule that vibrates in the stomach is compared to drinking water before a meal by MIT. The latter is a technique that dieticians advise to make the brain feel full by sending signals through the stomach. The inventors of the new device also propose it as a potential alternative to surgery and GLP-1s. These are drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy, which belong to the semaglutide class and are very effective but also very costly, partly due to the IP laws of the pharma industry.
The capsule has shown some success in the lab. When given to test animals 20 minutes before a meal, it reduced their food intake by about 40%, according to the team. Similar to the water trick, the capsule activates mechanoreceptors, which communicate with the brain via the vagus cranial nerve. This triggers the production of insulin, GLP-1, C-peptide and PYY hormones, which lower hunger and increase digestion.
“Using the endogenous system rather than any exogenous therapeutic leads to a profound behavioral change,” says associate professor Giovanni Traverso. “We have the possibility to overcome some of the challenges and costs related to delivering biologic drugs by modulating the enteric nervous system.”
The capsule is roughly as big as a regular multi-vitamin and contains a vibrating motor, powered by a silver oxide battery. When it reaches the stomach, gastric acid erodes the outer layer and completes the circuit, starting the vibration.
The team is working to determine not only the effectiveness but also the safety of the system. That requires a way to increase production and eventually test it on humans. “Our device could be manufactured at a fairly cost-effective price point at scale,” says post-doc researcher, Shriya Srinivasan.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/early-stage-hard-tech-firm-countdown-capital-shutting-down/,Early-stage hard tech firm Countdown Capital shutting down,"Here is a possible rewrite of the article:

Jai Malik, the founder and sole general partner of Countdown Capital, a venture capital firm that invests in early-stage hard tech industrial startups, announced in a yearly letter that he will close the fund by March and give back the remaining capital. The letter, which TechCrunch saw, explains that Malik made this decision after realizing two main things about the economics of early-stage hard tech investing: that “funding industrial startups is not inefficient enough to justify our existence” and that “larger, multi-stage venture firms are best positioned to generate strong returns on the most valuable industrial startups.”
In other words, that the fund would have a hard time making consistent profits due to capital constraints and growing competition from big players.
The sudden closure of the three-year-old fund suggests that early-stage hard tech funds face more challenges than the positive stories about “building for America” might imply. The letter is written with sharp clarity and feels like a wake-up call.
“Despite our performance to date, I’ve concluded that new investments are unlikely to yield strong returns,” Malik says. “As a result, I no longer believe that Countdown’s existence is justified, for both our LPs and Countdown management.” Malik declined to comment on this story.
The firm has supported some of the well-known names in the aerospace and defense sector, such as large satellite bus developer K2 Space, machining startup Hadrian, and cybersecurity company Galvanick. The firm’s website lists 12 investments in total. Among Countdown’s LPs were Craft Ventures’ David Sacks, Banana Capital’s Turner Novak and Homebrew VC’s Hunter Walk.
Interestingly, Countdown was relatively early to the American hard tech revival; the firm closed its first fund well before Andreessen Horowitz launched its American Dynamism practice, probably the largest and most famous U.S. fund focused on strengthening “the national interest” across sectors like manufacturing, aviation and others.
TechCrunch covered Countdown’s second $15 million fund in September 2022; at the time, Malik said that the firm was filling a gap at the very early stages for capital-intensive businesses. A year and a bit later, however, it’s clear that the early-stage opportunities Malik was targeting have not turned out as expected. Countdown’s first fund was $3 million.
The letter offers larger narratives about early-stage hard tech industrials investing that cast doubt on the ability of small, specialist funds to compete against multi-stage incumbents.
Malik explicitly mentions this fact toward the end of the letter, when he writes: “To be clear, we’re not bearish on venture capital or the future success of venture-scale hard tech companies at large. We’re bearish on the ability of small, early-stage funds — particularly sectionally focused ones — to continue exploiting these opportunities profitably.”
In the letter, Malik links large multi-stage firms investing in hard tech industrial startups to the slowdown in growth in software-as-a-service (SaaS) businesses. But he says that the rate of overall value growth for industrial startups will not outpace the rate of investment from large firms. “Consequently, we think early access to the best companies for a specialized, early-stage venture firm like Countdown will become more limited,” he says. “The most successful early-stage, specialist firms may simply resemble less-profitable ‘derivatives’ of top-performing multi-stage firms, like Founders Fund.”
Malik goes on to say that he thought Countdown had or could develop competitive advantages to outcompete against other firms, multi-stage or early-stage, but that these “are unlikely to prevail.” These advantages could be things like incubation or other approaches that require more time and money than the small-AUM firm could afford.
He said that this lack of competitive advantage was already noticeable: In three cases, Countdown came close to investing in a company’s first round, only for the firm to be priced out by a larger multi-stage firm: “A 50-100% price difference at the pre-seed and seed stage is immaterial to a multi-stage firm managing billions of dollars, but can and should be the difference between a yes and no for a firm of our size.”
Another issue, Malik says, is that the top-performing industrial startups are inaccessible to early-stage firms because they are priced efficiently early on. For example, Malik estimates that Anduril, The Boring Company and Redwood Materials were priced at roughly $60 million, $1 billion and $200 million, respectively, in their first outside rounds; Countdown would’ve had to invest an enormous portion of its fund to acquire even just 3% of each company.
By March end, the firm will finish all pending investments, give back capital, cancel all uncalled commitments and permanently stop operation apart from current asset management, Malik said.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/ev-tax-credit-eligibility-tesla-ford-chevy/,Here are the 5 EVs that qualify for the full federal tax credit in 2024,"Here is a possible rewritten version of the article:

The federal government has announced the electric vehicles that are eligible for the maximum federal tax credit under the new and stricter rules, and they are very few. Only five EVs can get the full $7,500 rebate: the Chevy Bolt from General Motors, which is being discontinued, and some versions of the Tesla Model 3, Model Y and Model X, and the Ford F-150 Lightning.
Some other EVs, such as some models of Rivian’s R1S and R1T, and a few plug-in hybrids, can get half of that amount, $3,750. The plug-in hybrid Chrysler Pacifica managed to keep the full credit. That’s it.
The new requirements were unclear until this list was released on Monday, and many people were confused about what would qualify. Even Tesla seemed unsure in its own way.
The reason the list is so short is because lawmakers want to change the EV supply chain — or at least make it more diverse — from China to North America in the long term. In the short term, that means automakers who depend a lot on Chinese suppliers, especially for battery materials and parts, are losing eligibility. This is in addition to some other limitations, such as the fact that the vehicles must be made in North America, and must cost less than either $55,000 or $80,000, depending on vehicle type.
While it will be more difficult to find a vehicle that qualifies for the federal EV tax credit, the credit itself is much better for consumers in two important ways. First, the credit is now applied when buying the car, meaning you don’t have to wait to claim it on your tax returns.
Second, buyers no longer have to have a tax liability equal to or greater than the amount of the credit — a rule that previously prevented a lot of buyers from accessing the credit in the first place. (That said, buyers still have to have certain adjusted gross income to qualify. Here’s a list of FAQs from the IRS.)
Some automakers, like GM, have said they are working on replacing parts that are disqualifying their EVs from the credit, so the list could grow as the year goes on. A lot of automakers and suppliers are rushing to build new factories in North America in order to ease the burden in the years to come. But until that happens, here’s the full list of what’s eligible:

Chevrolet Bolt EV

Chrysler Pacifica PHEV
Ford F-150 Lightning Extended Range

https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/crowdfunding-is-actually-good/,Debunking the myth that crowdfunding is only good for cash,"Here is a possible rewritten version of the article:

Startups can benefit from equity crowdfunding, which allows them to raise funds from both unaccredited and accredited investors, instead of relying on venture capital. This option has become more attractive in recent years as venture funding is more scarce and regulatory changes enable companies to raise more money at once.
However, many VCs are not fans of equity crowdfunding and often criticize it. They claim that equity crowdfunding is only for startups that fail to attract venture funding. And they also dismiss the money raised this way as just cash that does not come with the value that an investor can provide, such as their network that can help with recruitment and customer acquisition, or their own guidance and expertise.
But startups that have used equity crowdfunding disagree with the VCs and say they are just biased.
Chris Lustrino, the founder and CEO of KingsCrowd, a platform for crowdfunding data, believes that crowdfunding is more than just a way to raise money. He told TechCrunch+ that KingsCrowd has been able to get loyal investors, customers and even talent from their crowdfunding campaigns, and he has seen many other startups do the same.
“I would argue that the venture capital value-add is almost nonexistent in reality,” Lustrino said. “They want to keep their monopoly.”","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1191380440.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-01-02 16:00:13

Rivian announced on Tuesday that it made 17,541 vehicles at its Normal, Illinois plant and shipped 13,972 to customers in the last quarter of the year, mixed results that made investors cautious and caused shares to drop in pre-market trading.
Rivian shares fell 9.75% to $21.17 at 1:40 pm ET.
Rivian had shown steady growth in production and deliveries in the first three quarters of the year. And while production numbers kept rising in the last quarter, deliveries declined by 10.2% from the previous quarter. This could indicate weakening demand for the company’s range of premium EVs. Rivian makes four vehicles: its two consumer vehicles, the R1T truck and R1S SUV, and two versions of its commercial van.
Reduced demand for high-priced EVs has affected automakers, forcing many to lower production or cut prices. Rivian has managed to avoid reducing prices. If deliveries keep falling into 2024, the automaker may have to adopt that strategy in an effort to increase its numbers. That would be bad news for Rivian, which is not yet profitable.
The cost of building one Rivian vehicle continues to be an obstacle to the company’s path toward profitability. Rivian’s consumer R1T and R1S vehicles sell for more than $80,000, on average. But the cost of building far exceeds any revenue it generates. In the second quarter, for example, the company lost $32,495 on every vehicle it made.
Rivian said during its third-quarter earnings that it reduced that per unit loss by $2,000 compared to the second quarter by simplifying its product portfolio and lowering material and labor costs. Cutting the sticker price would only add more pressure on margins.
On a full-year basis, Rivian made 57,232 vehicles and shipped 50,122. This surpassed the automaker’s most recent full-year 2023 production guidance of 54,000 vehicles.
The company also announced that it will report fourth-quarter earning after markets close February 21.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/rivian-Your_electric_adventure_awaits._Reserve_an_R1T_228.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-01-02 14:40:40

Educators are often wary of generative AI and its potential to undermine the learning process. They worry about the risks of machine-generated essays and plagiarism, as well as the ""hallucinations"" - where the system confidently states something that is false because it lacks the knowledge to tell otherwise - of tools like ChatGPT and Bard. They fear that generative AI will become a shortcut for learners who want to pass a test without really understanding the material.
However, AI can also be a powerful ally for education, as ChatGPT has already shown by becoming an informal tutor for millions of people. It can change how we learn and enhance our connection with education. We can imagine an AI-powered teaching assistant that can mentor, support, and guide learners through the content in a personalized way. And the best part is that AI can scale to reach anyone who needs it.
AI can make learning fun and engaging - and for many people, it already has. The reasons behind this have more to do with the basic principles of what makes a learner interested, motivated, and curious than with the latest breakthroughs in AI and computer science.
I grew up in Armenia, where I was fascinated by the math Olympiads and their competitive nature. I wanted to win so badly that I spent hours studying and practicing. But later, when I studied math at MIT, I couldn't find the same drive. I've devoted much of my life to exploring and understanding what motivates learning, which inspired me to write this article and to create CodeSignal.
What do we mean by fun and engaging?
Education has always relied on the human factor, and it's hard to envision a scenario where machines can take over that role.
When I say that AI can make learning fun and engaging, I mean that it can create a sense of enthusiasm and eagerness - a hunger for self-improvement and growth that stays with the learner even after they've achieved their initial goal. In other words, this means creating long-term motivation. This is a challenge that many educators face, and there is a lot of research on this topic in education.
Motivation is crucial. Whether you're learning a new language or starting a career in programming, learning is a process that requires repetition, where the learner gradually builds confidence and fluency over time. Zed Shaw, a renowned programming educator, once called this ""climbing a mountain of ignorance."" The first few months - when you're not confident and don't understand the subject - are the toughest, and it's very easy to quit. That's why you need an external force to push the learner to keep going. Confidence, skill, and maybe even excellence are within reach.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GettyImages-482765551.jpg?resize=1200,720",2024-01-02 14:35:55
https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/tesla-2023-sales-figures-price-cuts/,Tesla's cheapest cars helped it notch another record year,"Here is a possible rewritten version of the article:

Tesla surpassed its annual targets for electric vehicle production and delivery by a small margin, thanks to a record-breaking quarter. The company announced in a press release on Tuesday morning that it made 1.85 million EVs and delivered 1.81 million in 2023.
The bulk of Tesla's output and sales came from its most economical EVs, the Model 3 and Model Y, which represented more than 96% of the total numbers. Tesla produced almost 500,000 cars in the last quarter of the year at its plants in California, Texas, Germany and China, and shipped 484,507 worldwide. That includes a few Cybertrucks, which began rolling out late last year with a price tag of around $100,000. But we don't have a precise figure for how many Cybertrucks the company has sold so far as it is combining those numbers with Model S and X sales in an ""other models"" category.
The impressive performance in the final quarter follows a drop in Tesla's deliveries in the third quarter for the first time in a year, due to some factory closures — something that hindered CEO Elon Musk's more ambitious goal of making 2 million cars this year. The company changed its prices frequently throughout the year, starting with big price reductions, which has eroded its industry-leading profit margins.
Tesla's successful year is also largely attributed to the company's growth in China, where the market is becoming increasingly competitive due to price cuts from rivals. That includes BYD, which has recently been on track to beat Tesla's global EV sales.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2021-Tesla-Model-Y-Goodbye-085.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-01-02 14:26:58
https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/02/openai-dublin-data-controller/,OpenAI moves to shrink regulatory risk in EU around data privacy,"Here is a possible rewrite of the article:

OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, sent an email to its users in late December with some changes to its terms that seem to reduce its legal risk in the EU. The AI giant's chatbot has been under scrutiny in the region for how it affects people's privacy and how it handles their data. Some regulators in Italy and Poland have opened investigations into ChatGPT's data processing and data generation, and even suspended it temporarily in Italy until OpenAI improved its user information and controls.
The email said: ""We have changed the OpenAI entity that provides services such as ChatGPT to EEA and Swiss residents to our Irish entity, OpenAI Ireland Limited.""
The updated Privacy Policy for Europe also says:
If you live in the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland, OpenAI Ireland Limited, with its registered office at 1st Floor, The Liffey Trust Centre, 117-126 Sheriff Street Upper, Dublin 1, D01 YC43, Ireland, is the controller and is responsible for the processing of your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy.
The new terms of use that name its Dublin-based subsidiary as the data controller for EEA and Swiss users, where the GDPR applies, will take effect on February 15 2024. Users can delete their account if they don't agree with the new terms.
The GDPR has a mechanism that allows companies that process data of Europeans to have a single lead data regulator in an EU Member State where they have their main establishment. This makes it easier for them to deal with privacy oversight and limits the power of other regulators in the bloc to act on their own. They can still intervene locally if there are urgent risks, but this is rare and usually temporary. Most of the GDPR oversight goes through the lead authority. This is why many big tech companies have chosen to make their EU home in Dublin.
OpenAI has been in contact with Ireland's data regulator, the DPC, and other EU regulators about this matter, a DPC spokesperson told TechCrunch. OpenAI did not respond to our request for comment.
The AI giant opened a Dublin office in September and hired some policy, legal and privacy staff as well as some back office roles. It still has only five open positions in Dublin out of 100 on its careers page, so it doesn't seem to have a large presence there yet. Most of its open positions are in San Francisco or the U.S. One of the Dublin-based roles it is looking for is a privacy software engineer.
To get main establishment status under the GDPR, OpenAI will have to show that its Dublin-based entity can influence how it processes data of Europeans. It will need to have the right expertise and legal structures to put privacy checks on its U.S. parent. It can't just have a front office in Dublin that approves product decisions made in San Francisco.
However, OpenAI may be inspired by X, formerly known as Twitter, which has kept its main establishment status despite Elon Musk taking over and making drastic changes to its regional staff and product decisions. (So go figure.)
If OpenAI gets GDPR main established status in Ireland, it will join Apple, Google, Meta, TikTok and X among others that have their lead regulator there. The DPC has been criticized for being slow and lenient with its GDPR oversight of big tech companies. It has issued some big fines recently but often lower than what other regulators wanted. It has also been slow or reluctant to investigate some complaints or changed them in ways that avoided the main issue (for example, this Google adtech complaint).
Any existing GDPR investigations of ChatGPT, such as by Italy and Poland, may still matter as they concern data processing before OpenAI gets main establishment status. But their impact may be limited.
OpenAI's updated European privacy policy also has more details on why it thinks it can process people's data for AI model training without their consent. It says it is ""necessary for our legitimate interests and those of third parties and broader society"". The current policy just says it is for ""protecting our Services from abuse, fraud, or security risks, or in developing, improving, or promoting our Services"".
This suggests OpenAI may try to argue that its massive data collection for generative AI profit is also good for the public interest when facing European privacy regulators. But the GDPR has a specific list of six valid reasons for processing personal data and data controllers can't just mix and match them to make up their own justification.
It's also worth noting that GDPR regulators have been working together to find common ground on how to deal with big data and AI through a taskforce set up last year within the European Data Protection Board. But it's not clear if they will reach any consensus on this. And if OpenAI establishes a legal entity in Dublin as the controller of European users' data now, Ireland may end up having the final say on how gener","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1173441590.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-01-02 14:13:57
https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/oral-peptides-a-new-era-in-drug-development/41404/,Oral peptides: A new era in drug development,"Here is a possible rewritten version of the article:

A new milestone in oral peptide drug development has been achieved by scientists from the lab of Professor Christian Heinis at EPFL. They have developed a method to create oral peptides, a novel class of drugs that can be taken by mouth, overcoming a long-standing challenge in the pharmaceutical industry. The study, titled ‘De novo development of small cyclic peptides that are orally bioavailable,’ is published in Nature Chemical Biology.
Professor Heinis said: “There are many diseases where we know the targets, but we cannot develop drugs that bind and reach them. These are mostly cancers, and many of the targets are protein-protein interactions that are essential for the cancer growth but cannot be inhibited.”
Oral peptides with enhanced stability
The researchers focused on cyclic peptides, which are versatile molecules that can bind to difficult disease targets with high affinity and specificity. However, cyclic peptides have been hard to develop as oral drugs, because they are quickly degraded or poorly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract.
The research team aimed at the enzyme thrombin, which is a key target for preventing and treating thrombotic disorders like strokes and heart attacks, because it plays a crucial role in blood coagulation. To create oral peptides that can target thrombin and are stable enough, the scientists used a two-step combinatorial synthesis strategy to make a large library of cyclic peptides with thioether bonds, which improve their metabolic stability when taken by mouth.
Heinis said: “We have now succeeded in creating cyclic peptides that bind to a chosen disease target and can also be given orally. We have developed a new method where thousands of small cyclic peptides with random sequences are chemically made on a nanoscale and tested in a high-throughput process.”
The one pot, two steps method
The new method involves two steps and takes place in the same reaction vessel, which chemists call ‘one pot’. The first step is to make linear peptides, which then undergo a chemical process of forming a ring-like structure. This is done using bis-electrophilic linkers – chemical compounds that connect two molecular groups – to form stable thioether bonds. In the second phase, the cyclic peptides undergo acylation, which adds carboxylic acids to them, further diversifying their molecular structure.
The technique avoids the need for intermediate purification steps, allowing for high-throughput screening directly in the synthesis plates, combining the synthesis and screening of thousands of peptides to find candidates with high affinity for specific disease targets – in this case, thrombin.
When tested on rats, the oral peptides showed up to 18% bioavailability, which means that when the cyclic peptide drug is given by mouth, 18% of it successfully enters the bloodstream and has a therapeutic effect. Since oral peptides usually show a bioavailability below 2%, increasing that number to 18% is a significant advance for drugs in the biologics category, including peptides.
Future prospects of this pharmaceutical advance
By enabling the creation of oral peptides, the team has opened up opportunities for treating various diseases that have been hard to address with conventional oral drugs. The method’s versatility means it can be adapted to target a wide range of proteins, potentially leading to breakthroughs in areas where medical needs are currently unmet.
“To apply the method to more challenging disease targets, such as protein-protein interactions, larger libraries will likely need to be made and studied,” said Manuel Merz, PhD student and leader of the research.
In the next step of this project, the researchers will target several intracellular protein-protein interaction targets for which it has been difficult to develop inhibitors based on classical small molecules. They are confident that oral peptides can be developed for at least some of them.

A new study suggests that crops that can withstand climate change are needed to fight nutrition insecurity in sub-Saharan Africa.
Sub-Saharan African farmers should diversify their crops and grow less maize, which is vulnerable to climate change, and more fruits, vegetables, and crops like cassava, millet, and sorghum, which can provide the essential micronutrients for good health.
The researchers also say that the amount of food produced needs to increase, and more land needs to be used for agriculture.
The study, which involved more than 50 researchers and consultations with policymakers and other stakeholders in the food and agriculture sectors in four sub-Saharan African countries: Malawi, South Africa, Tanzania, and Zambia, was published in the scientific journal Nature Food.
Sub-Saharan Africa faces food and nutrition insecurity challenges
Sub-Saharan Africa has a population of 1.2 billion people, according to the World Bank. This is projected to grow by 740 million people by 2050.
Climate change will create extreme conditions that will affect what crops can be grown, and farmers will have to produce more food to meet the growing demand.
The team warns that the population faces food and nutrition insecurity risks unless effective ways of adapting to climate change are found.
Professor Jennie Macdiarmid, from the Rowett Institute at the University of Aberdeen and one of the authors of the paper, said: “The study has shown the need to put nutrition at the centre of agricultural policy to avoid the long-term unintended consequence of failing to produce food that can meet the nutritional needs of the population.
“If policy solutions focus only on increasing production of calories and adapting to be climate smart, it is likely there will be negative consequences for health through nutritionally poor diets.”
Building a resilient agricultural system
The researchers used the iFEED assessment framework to examine policy options to build an agricultural system that is resilient to climate change and tackles nutrition insecurity.
“Food, agriculture and nutrition policies often sit in siloes across different government departments,” said Dr Jennings, a Research Fellow in the School of Earth and Environment at the University of Leeds.
“This study provides holistic evidence that combines information on the environmental impacts of food system changes and the changes needed for population-level nutrition security.
“The research shows that action can be taken to adapt to climate change and improve nutrition security in sub-Saharan Africa.”
A transformative approach is needed to incorporate nutritional needs
Stakeholders in each country identified key uncertainties in the future of the food system. iFEED considers these uncertainties and identifies agricultural policies to be considered.
To fight nutrition insecurity, scientists argue that there needs to be a fundamental change in agriculture.
One option is to switch to soybean production. This is because soybean crops are more resilient to climate change than maize.
Dr Ndashe Kapulu said: “Many countries in sub-Saharan Africa will be better able to cope with climate change and other stresses if they have more diverse food systems, such as the transition to soybean production in Zambia.
“As scientists, we need to generate enough evidence in our research to help make changes that support and guide actions to make the agrifood system more resilient.”
Increasing the production of animal-based products
In sub-Saharan Africa, increasing the production and consumption of animal-based products could help fight nutrition insecurity. However, the researchers argue that it should not reach the unsustainable production levels seen in higher-income countries.
An increase in animal-based products would cause an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, but this could be acceptable to reduce sub-Saharan Africa’s need to reduce the risk of nutritionally inadequate diets.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/©-shutterstockCreative-Nerd_1379661350-1024x576.jpg,2024-01-02 11:42:55

Don't miss the chance to network, learn, and chat with leaders in San Francisco on January 10. Request your invite here.
The New York Times has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft last Wednesday, accusing them of copying and using its copyrighted works without permission. The lawsuit claims that the defendants owe the Times ""billions of dollars in statutory and actual damages"" and demands that they destroy any chatbot models and training data that contain the Times' content.
This lawsuit could be a landmark case in the field of AI and copyright, as many legal experts have anticipated that such a case could reach the Supreme Court. The outcome could have major implications for the future of AI and the publishing industry.
The legal dispute over generative AI has been simmering for a while
I interviewed Bradford Newman, a partner at Baker McKenzie in Palo Alto, back in August 2022, before ChatGPT was launched. He told me about the legal challenges that generative AI poses.

He said that there is little legal guidance right now, and that there will be different arguments about fair use versus infringement. He predicted that different courts will have different opinions, and that eventually, this issue will go to the Supreme Court.
Moreover, some industries that are affected by generative AI are not waiting for the courts to decide, especially in areas like publishing and entertainment. In September, I talked to Marc Rotenberg, president and founder of the Center for AI and Digital Policy, and an adjunct professor at Georgetown Law School. He told me that he was expecting the New York Times to take legal action against OpenAI.
The showdown between the New York Times and OpenAI is here
He mentioned the famous case of Authors Guild v. Google, which lasted for 10 years and ended with Google winning the right to digitize books under fair use. He said that Google benefited from that case, but the publishers and the news industry did not, and that they are in trouble now.
He said that the New York Times, which survived the first battle, is now aware that they may be in trouble too, because if AI models can use their high-quality data and replicate their content, they could lose their business. He said that this is one of the most interesting legal cases involving AI today: the clash between one of the most respected publishers, The New York Times, and one of the most influential generative AI firms OpenAI.
OpenAI lawyers are ready to fight back
OpenAI and Microsoft are likely to have a strong defense strategy in this case. In July, I spoke to a prominent lawyer who specializes in copyright law and who is defending OpenAI in some of the cases filed by authors who claim that OpenAI infringed their copyrights. He said that these cases will shape the future of innovation and copyright law.
He said that every 20 years or so, there is a new and significant question that affects how the commercial world works. He gave examples of cases involving VCRs in the 1980s and Web 2.0 in the 2000s. He said that we are now seeing the next big wave of litigation over these tools that will have a profound effect on society.
He told me that he was confident that the position of the technology companies is correct and should prevail. He said that copyright is often used to address problems that it was not designed to solve, such as labor or privacy issues. He said that there are other laws that deal with those concerns.
He also said that changing copyright law to protect any industry is a bad idea that will not work because it will not apply outside the US. He said that these tools will continue to exist regardless of where they are based or launched.
He said: ""You couldn't put this cat back in the bag.""",https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Untitled-design-2024-01-02T105616.348.png?w=1200&strip=all,2024-01-02 17:29:48
