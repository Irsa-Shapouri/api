This year, despite the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, Apple is expected to hold the conference in June. While the official announcement has yet to be made, we can make some educated guesses based on previous years.

In the past, Apple would have announced the date of WWDC around this time. However, in the last three years, the announcement has come later. In 2021 and 2022, the date was revealed in late March and early April, respectively. So, we can expect the announcement to be made soon.

As for the timing of WWDC 2024, it will likely take place in early June, as it always has, unless there are unforeseen circumstances like a pandemic. In 2020, due to Covid-19, the dates were pushed to late June. But in other years, it has consistently been in the first full week of June, starting on a Monday and running until Friday.

Based on this pattern, we can predict that WWDC 2024 will take place from Monday, June 3 to Friday, June 7. However, there is also a possibility that it could be the following week, from Monday, June 10 to Friday, June 14. This is still within the typical timeframe for WWDC, which has ended as late as June 11 in previous years.

In terms of format, WWDC has undergone some changes since 2020. In that year, the keynote was pre-recorded, and there were no in-person attendees. This was a departure from previous years when thousands of people gathered in a large auditorium to watch the keynote live.

Since then, every keynote has been recorded, but Apple has gradually increased the number of attendees in Cupertino. While the numbers are still significantly lower than pre-Covid years, last year saw an increase compared to the previous year.

For WWDC 2024, it is likely that we will see a similar format. The keynote will be pre-recorded, with Tim Cook and Craig Federighi presenting live on stage at Apple Park. There will be some attendees, including VIPs, press, staff, and a small number of other attendees.

As for the timing of the keynote, Apple has always scheduled it for 10 a.m. local time, specifically Pacific Daylight Time. This timing allows for a global audience to tune in and watch the event.

Once the official announcement is made, we will provide more details and insights. Stay tuned for updates on this exciting event.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600830c22fb840e0281afe2/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 16:00:15,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have more in common than you might think. Both companies experienced significant growth due to their core businesses emerging from unexpected circumstances. AWS realized it could sell its internal services to others, while Nvidia discovered that its gaming GPU was well-suited for AI workloads.

In recent quarters, Nvidia's revenue has grown at an astonishing rate, from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024 to $22.1 billion in Q4 2024. However, the majority of this growth came from the company's data center business. On the other hand, AWS has consistently been a revenue driver for Amazon, but its growth has slowed down over time.

The success of both companies can be attributed to being in the right place at the right time. As web apps and mobile technology emerged, the cloud became a valuable resource for enterprises. Similarly, the rise of AI and large language models coincided with the increased use of GPUs for processing these workloads.

While AWS has become a highly profitable business, its growth has started to plateau. Nvidia, on the other hand, is experiencing a surge in growth. The question is whether Nvidia can sustain this growth and become a revenue powerhouse like AWS. If the GPU market tightens, Nvidia has other businesses, but they are smaller and growing more slowly than the data center business.

In terms of financial outlook, Nvidia's revenue growth has been astronomical in recent quarters, and it is expected to continue. In its recent earnings report, Nvidia projected $24 billion worth of revenue for its current quarter, a 234% growth compared to the previous year. However, as the company's revenue ramp slows down, its growth rate is expected to decline.

Analysts predict that Nvidia will generate $110.5 billion in revenue for the current fiscal year, an 81% increase from the previous year. While this is lower than the 126% gain in the previous fiscal year, it still demonstrates significant growth for the company.

Looking ahead, AI presents a promising opportunity for Nvidia. Despite increasing competition from AMD, Intel, and other chipmakers, Nvidia is currently in control of the market. However, as competition intensifies, Nvidia may have to cede some market share.

In conclusion, Nvidia's growth trajectory resembles that of AWS, and the company has the potential to become a long-term revenue powerhouse. While some growth declines are expected, the future looks promising for Nvidia, particularly in the AI sector. As competition increases, Nvidia will need to stay ahead of the curve to maintain its position in the market.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation

Welcome back, Wordle enthusiasts! It's Monday, and we're ready to tackle another puzzle. But before we dive into today's Wordle, let's take a moment to reflect on the weekend.

It was an unusual one, wasn't it? Just as we were embracing the arrival of spring, Mother Nature decided to surprise us with a snowy twist. Despite the unexpected weather, I must admit that the winter wonderland outside my window is quite breathtaking.

But let's not dwell on the weather for too long. It's time to get back to work and, of course, back to Wordling! So, without further ado, let's unravel today's puzzle.

Wordle Analysis

Every day, I eagerly check my Wordle Bot to see how I fared. If you're curious about your own Wordle performance, you can do the same with Wordle Bot.

I must admit, today's puzzle had me scratching my head. It started off on the wrong foot, leaving me with a whopping 195 possible solutions after my initial attempts. Even after narrowing it down to 40 with the word ""boink,"" I was still at a loss.

But then, a breakthrough! ""Allay"" turned out to be a fantastic guess. It revealed the existence of multiple 'L's and left me with just one word to ponder. I almost went with ""palsy"" before realizing that I needed that second 'L.' After some brainstorming, I finally settled on ""sally."" Admittedly, I usually think of it as a name, but it also refers to a battle tactic from days of yore.

Competitive Wordle Score

Once again, no points for guessing in four or tying the Bot. It's a big, fat zero for me.

Today's Wordle Etymology

The word ""sally,"" when used as a non-proper noun, primarily means to suddenly rush forth or launch a sudden attack from a defensive position. It can also refer to embarking on a journey or undertaking a new venture. The etymology of ""sally"" in this context is quite fascinating, tracing its roots through various languages before making its way into English.

The term originates from the Middle French word ""sallie,"" which is the noun form of ""sallir,"" meaning ""to rush out, leap forth."" ""Sallir"" itself can be traced back to the Latin word ""salire,"" meaning ""to leap."" This Latin root has given rise to several related words in English, such as ""salient"" (prominently projecting) and ""assail"" (to attack), all reflecting the concept of movement or leaping forth.

Therefore, the etymology of ""sally"" captures the essence of sudden and unexpected movement, whether it be launching a physical attack from a fortified position or embarking on a new journey or venture.

The intense final saw Sentinels go head-to-head with Gen.G, the two strongest teams in the competition. Gen.G started strong with a 13-8 win on Breeze, but Sentinels quickly bounced back, taking Bind 14-12 in overtime to even the series at 1-1. Gen.G regained their momentum on Ascent with another 13-8 victory, putting them on match point. However, Sentinels fought back on Split, winning 13-10 and forcing a final map to determine the champion.

The decisive map was Icebox, and the competition remained fierce. After 10 rounds, the score was tied at 5-5. Sentinels then took two rounds before the break, giving them a 7-5 advantage heading into the final half of the tournament. After the break, Sentinels extended their lead to 9-5 before Gen.G secured another round. However, this would be the last round Gen.G would win, as Sentinels claimed a convincing 13-6 victory, clinching both the map and the championship.

Sentinels' victory earned them a well-deserved first-place prize of $250,000, while Gen.G received $100,000 for their impressive performance. Third-place finishers, Paper Rex, walked away with $65,000, while LOUD, who finished in fourth place, received $35,000.

Heading into the final, Gen.G was considered the slight favorite, having defeated Sentinels in the upper bracket final just a few days earlier. Gen.G had dominated the tournament, winning all their matches in the Swiss stage against Loud and EDward Gaming. They continued their success in the knockout stage, defeating Paper Rex before facing Sentinels for the first time, where they emerged victorious with a score of 2-1.

Sentinels also showcased their strength throughout the tournament, going undefeated in the Swiss stage with wins against Team Heretics and Karmine Corp. They defeated Loud in the opening round of the knockout stage, suffered a loss to Gen.G, and then secured a rematch against Paper Rex in the final.

In addition to the thrilling matches, Valorant Masters Madrid introduced a new agent, Clove, to the game. Clove possesses the unique ability to resurrect and create smokes from beyond the grave. This new addition has generated excitement among players, who hope Clove will prove more impactful than the underwhelming previous agent, Iso.

Valorant Masters Madrid was a showcase of intense competition, with Sentinels ultimately emerging as the worthy champions. Their victory against Gen.G, the tournament favorites, solidified their position as one of the strongest teams in the Valorant scene. As fans eagerly anticipate future tournaments, the introduction of Clove adds an exciting dimension to the game, setting the stage for thrilling gameplay and strategic possibilities.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600832a1389114562dc7741/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 17:13:21,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewwight/2024/03/24/helping-patients-access-sickle-cell-disease-treatments-in-west-africa/,Helping Patients Access Sickle Cell Disease Treatments In West Africa,"A researcher from Cameroon is on a mission to help patients in low-income countries in West Africa access affordable medicine for sickle cell disease. With over 4 million people worldwide affected by sickle cell disease, 80% of cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa, and 89% of women in Central and West Africa lack access to universal medical coverage. Dr. Marthe-Sandrine Eiymo Mwa Mpollo, a scientist and co-founder of NaYa Health, recognized that simply having a drug for sickle cell disease is not enough; affordability is crucial.

Dr. Mpollo's experience working as a medical scientist in the pharmaceutical industry led her to the realization that without access to medication, research fails to deliver its promise to patients, especially in the Global South where disease prevalence is high. This inspired her to establish NaYa Health, a digital patient assistance platform aimed at helping underserved patients without insurance have timely access to medication, even when they are short on cash. NaYa Health achieves this through community savings, deferred payments, and a portable health-only savings account that helps manage health risks and protect earnings.

In a pilot implementation in Cameroon's capital, NaYa Health successfully empowered informal workers to handle unexpected challenges, increased income for local medical providers, and ensured guaranteed access to critical services. Their work has gained recognition, and they were selected in the financial inclusion challenge by MIT Solve.

Dr. Mpollo's passion for medicine in Cameroon stems from her childhood experiences watching ""doctors without borders"" shows in the late 1980s. These shows made her aware of the devastating impact of sickle cell disease on affected individuals and their families, beyond the financial burden. They also sparked her desire to bring healthcare to challenged communities. While her initial goal was to become a medical doctor, her journey led her to life science research in Canada and the US, where she obtained a doctorate in developing therapies for sickle cell disease.

After publishing scientific papers on lung damage in sickle cell patients and communicating research findings, Dr. Mpollo realized that access to medication is crucial for research to fulfill its life-saving potential. This realization prompted her to launch NaYa Health. She emphasizes that scientists from the Global South have a unique perspective on the limitations faced in their settings, particularly in terms of affordability, access, and cultural acceptance of research findings. Scientists from the Global South can better tailor their research to address the most impactful issues in their communities and collaborate with local actors to define or adapt distribution models for scientific findings.

In another part of Africa, a team of entrepreneurs, researchers, and health professionals in Zambia is utilizing artificial intelligence to improve care for pregnant women. Despite a significant decrease in Zambia's maternal death rate, there is still a 1% risk of death during pregnancy or childbirth for Zambian women. Tafadzwa Kalisto Munzwa, the founder and CEO of Dawa Health, based in Lusaka, Zambia, spearheads the DawaMom project. This initiative combines AI tools, last-mile health workers, mobile clinics, and digital platforms to enhance maternal and child health.

Through DawaMom, over 60 community health workers provide in-community healthcare, and more than 800 mothers have signed up on the mobile platform. The project utilizes generative AI models that directly engage with patients and respond to their needs. By leveraging technology and community-based healthcare, Dawa Health aims to reduce maternal mortality rates and improve the well-being of pregnant women in Zambia.

These examples highlight the innovative approaches researchers and entrepreneurs are taking to address healthcare challenges in Africa. From ensuring access to affordable medication for sickle cell disease to utilizing AI to improve maternal and child health, these initiatives are making a significant impact on underserved communities. By combining scientific research with practical solutions, these individuals are transforming healthcare delivery and saving lives.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66009a73668df974c31e0a4f/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=579,579,x127,y431,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 17:54:08,Innovation,Innovation
