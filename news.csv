https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/03/25/understanding-the-implications-of-the-sec-incident-disclosure-rules/,Understanding The Implications Of The SEC Incident Disclosure Rules,"In December 2023, the SEC implemented new rules regarding cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance, and incident disclosure for publicly traded companies. These rules now require companies to disclose any ""material cybersecurity incidents they experience"" within four business days via Form 8-K. Additionally, public companies must annually submit Form 10-K, which includes their processes for assessing, identifying, and managing cybersecurity threats. These regulations aim to increase transparency and accountability in cyber risk management.

The SEC emphasizes the importance of companies acknowledging whether they are taking steps to prevent or detect cyber incidents and minimize their negative effects. While the SEC does not require specific details about companies' cybersecurity measures, it recognizes that such information could be proprietary or beneficial to malicious actors. Therefore, the focus is on whether firms are actively assessing cyber risks, learning from past incidents, and effectively managing cyber risk at the executive and board level.

The objective of these rules is to inform investors rather than influence companies' cybersecurity risk management. However, it is essential to recognize that what gets measured gets managed. The new reporting requirements to the SEC will likely lead to increased attention and informal evaluation of cybersecurity practices across companies and industries. While it technically satisfies the SEC regulation to respond with ""none"" in terms of cyber preparation, this response may not be well-received by investors, business partners, and customers.

Comparing publicly available 10-K information will likely raise expectations for due diligence in corporate cybersecurity. While the cybersecurity requirements for a small publicly traded company in the consumer products sector may differ from those of a multinational corporation operating in critical infrastructure sectors, the foundational principles remain the same.

Determining the materiality of a cyber incident involves collaboration among various stakeholders within a company. Cyber experts focus on understanding the incident, managers address operational impact, the CFO and general counsel determine materiality, and the CEO and board decide on appropriate actions. Collaboration becomes even more critical during significant cyber incidents, as timelines are shorter, and the consequences of failure to collaborate can be severe.

Creating and following a playbook for cyber incident response is a best practice. This playbook should include worst-case scenarios as well as less catastrophic but still significant incidents that are more common in your industry. Conducting tabletop discussions to simulate potential incidents can help senior corporate officers and the board focus on the issue. Testing and refining the playbook based on lessons learned from these exercises and real incidents is crucial.

During a material cyber incident, the response team will likely extend beyond the company to include public and private sector partners. Federal organizations like the SEC offer guidance and expertise. It is advisable to reach out to these partners before experiencing a significant breach to benefit from their advice and make necessary improvements to enhance your organization's cyber resilience.

Private sector partners, such as digital forensics experts, incident response teams, and specialized legal counsel, can also provide valuable assistance. Additionally, it is important to involve key suppliers, business partners, and customers in your incident response plans to ensure a comprehensive approach.

In conclusion, the SEC's new cybersecurity rules encourage transparency and accountability in managing cyber risk for publicly traded companies. By disclosing material cybersecurity incidents and outlining their risk management processes, companies can enhance investor confidence and demonstrate their commitment to cybersecurity. Collaboration, incident response planning, and engagement with public and private sector partners are essential components of effective cyber risk management.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fdc7969c762b0830a28aba/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 09:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/03/25/finding-the-goldilocks-scenario-for-cyber-threat-response/,Finding The Goldilocks Scenario For Cyber Threat Response,"We have been hearing a lot about the Goldilocks scenario in the economy, where things are just right - not too hot, not too cold. But did you know that a similar challenge exists in the cybersecurity world? It involves finding the right balance between manual and automated cyber responses.

Automation has come a long way in cybersecurity, but a hybrid approach is still necessary. In the 1990s, my company implemented an intrusion detection system (IDS) that had the capability to block attacks in real time. However, it ended up blocking all our VPN traffic because it misinterpreted activity on our VPN solution as a denial-of-service attack. This incident highlighted the need for human oversight even with automation.

Nowadays, AI is taking automation to new levels. It can relieve analysts of certain tasks, allowing them to focus on more advanced projects. But the question remains - should we trust humans or AI more? Humans make mistakes, but AI is far from infallible. It can be trained for specific jobs, but its training only goes so far. In cybersecurity, training data can be touchy because not everything that looks malicious is malicious, and vice versa. Experienced analysts are still needed to make decisions regarding response.

So, a hybrid approach is the way to go. Automated threat response should be a partnership between humans and AI. While AI can assist analysts, it should not replace them entirely. Organizations still want to have a human in control to make decisions.

In addition to deciding on the level of automation, organizations also need to consider how to manage a hybrid solution. Centralized management is the most efficient option. Having separate solutions with their own AI capabilities may sound good, but it can make basic management and troubleshooting more complicated and time-consuming. With a centralized approach, the capabilities of various solutions can be centralized, making management easier.

Hyperautomation systems are designed to work with AI and other automated systems. They provide an orchestration platform that centralizes the capabilities of various solutions. This not only makes management easier but also improves efficiency and effectiveness.

In conclusion, finding the right balance between manual and automated cyber responses is crucial in cybersecurity. While automation has evolved, a hybrid approach is still necessary. Organizations should trust humans and AI in partnership rather than relying solely on one or the other. Centralized management is the most efficient way to handle a hybrid solution. By finding the right balance and utilizing hyperautomation systems, organizations can enhance their cybersecurity capabilities and stay ahead of evolving threats.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6570e0e1a0e6f153f1d0be06/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 09:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-deep-geothermal-renewable-powerhouse.html,Dig deep: US bets on geothermal to become renewable powerhouse,"Geothermal energy is gaining traction as a promising solution for the green transition. Despite currently representing only a small fraction of US energy production, advancements in technology and backing from businesses and the Biden administration are positioning geothermal energy as a clean and reliable power source for the future.

Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm believes that harnessing the heat beneath our feet can provide clean and scalable power for various sectors, from industries to households. The Department of Energy estimates that by 2050, geothermal energy could surpass hydroelectric and solar power in the US.

Currently, geothermal energy accounts for just 1.6 percent of US energy consumption in 2022. To increase production, the US government has invested over $200 million since 2018 in an experimental site in Utah. This site focuses on Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), which involve drilling exceptionally deep wells and injecting water into hot rocks deep underground. This approach eliminates the need for nearby hot springs or underground reservoirs.

Francesco d'Avack, an analyst with S&P Global Commodity Insights, states that geothermal energy has the potential to be utilized anywhere. Additionally, it reduces the upfront risk associated with drilling and the possibility of finding nothing, which has deterred some investors in the past.

Granholm emphasized another advantage of geothermal energy during her speech at the CERAWeek energy conference. The US government allows companies to convert permits for oil or gas exploration into geothermal licenses, streamlining the process and reducing paperwork and delays.

Unlike classic fracking, geothermal drilling requires fewer chemical additives and does not release hydrocarbons. Geothermal energy also offers a consistent flow of energy regardless of weather conditions or time of day. Cost-wise, the US government predicts a drop from the current range of $70 to $100 per megawatt hour (MWh) to $45 by 2035. The use of existing drilling technology makes geothermal development faster and more cost-effective.

The US has been at the forefront of adopting new geothermal technology. However, other countries, including France, have also established EGS sites, although they are still considered experimental. One potential risk associated with geothermal drilling is induced seismic activity, similar to fracking. To address this concern, the US Energy Department requires all funded projects to follow a mitigation protocol and is investing in research on the issue.

In the emerging geothermal market, several US and Canadian start-ups have attracted significant investments. Fervo Energy, for example, collaborated with Google to connect its Nevada site to the electric grid. While the site currently generates only 3.5 megawatts, the demand for geothermal energy is growing. Major companies like Google, Microsoft, and Nucor have announced plans to purchase geothermal energy.

Jigar Shah of the Energy Department's loan office believes that the willingness of large corporations to pay a premium for geothermal energy will stimulate private sector interest. However, the market is still in its early stages, and the first successful commercial facility is yet to be established. Once a company demonstrates the viability of geothermal energy, others are likely to follow suit.

As the geothermal sector continues to expand, careful and sustainable growth is crucial. Cindy Taff, CEO of Sage Geosystems, emphasizes the importance of establishing the first commercial facility to pave the way for future development. With the sector's potential untapped, strategic growth is essential to ensure long-term success.

In conclusion, geothermal energy holds immense potential as a clean and reliable power source. With technological advancements and increasing support from businesses and governments, geothermal energy could play a significant role in the green transition. As the sector continues to grow, it is vital to prioritize sustainable development and establish successful commercial facilities to inspire further investment and adoption.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/a-worker-operates-a-dr.jpg,2024-03-25 04:59:03,Innovation,Innovation

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-strategy-suppress-strain-propagation-ultrahigh.html,A strategy to suppress strain propagation in ultrahigh-Ni cathodes during fast charging,"To support the growing demand for the electronics industry and electric vehicles, researchers are constantly striving to improve battery technologies. One promising approach is the use of nickel-rich layered oxides as cathode materials in lithium-ion batteries (LiBs). These cathodes offer advantages such as increased battery capacity, improved rate capabilities, and lower fabrication costs. However, they also face limitations, including capacity degradation and structural instability during fast-charging and long-term cycling.

To address these challenges, researchers at Argonne National Laboratory and other institutes worldwide have developed a new strategy. They published their findings in a paper in Nature Energy, introducing the use of epitaxial entropy-assisted oxide coating to suppress strain propagation, which is responsible for the structural deterioration of cathodes during battery operation.

The team, led by Chen Zhao and Chuanwei Wang, designed a specialized oxide coating that aligns with the structure of the nickel-rich cathodes. This coating not only enhances the robustness of the cathode materials' surface but also improves ionic conductivity, enabling faster charging of batteries.

The coating is based on Wadsley-Roth crystallographic shear phases, compounds known for enhancing the performance of electrodes in LiBs. These compounds adhere well to nickel-rich cathodes, strengthening their structural stability during prolonged operation and fast charging.

Through a series of experiments, the researchers coated nickel-rich layered cathodes and tested their performance over time and under different conditions. The results were highly promising, as the coating significantly reduced damage to the cathodes, even during fast-charging and after multiple operation cycles.

The team's findings suggest that this epitaxial entropy-assisted coating strategy could open up new opportunities for surface engineering in the design and development of high-energy and high-power LiBs.

In conclusion, researchers have developed a novel strategy to enhance the performance and stability of nickel-rich cathodes in lithium-ion batteries. By utilizing epitaxial entropy-assisted oxide coating, they have successfully suppressed strain propagation, addressing the challenges of structural deterioration during battery operation. This breakthrough brings us one step closer to the development of advanced battery technologies that can meet the demands of the electronics industry and electric vehicles.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/a-strategy-to-suppress.jpg,2024-03-25 09:40:01,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/03/25/adopting-ai-legislation-and-best-practices/,Adopting AI Legislation And Best Practices,"The global artificial intelligence (AI) market is growing rapidly, with a projected value of $1.81 trillion by 2030. However, the legislation surrounding AI has not kept pace with its development, leading to debates and controversies over its role. It is crucial to understand the issue of AI legislation and what companies can do in the meantime.

Legislation is needed to govern the use of AI, as demonstrated by the recent Taylor Swift deepfake incident. As AI technology advances, it becomes easier to create fake photos, videos, and phone calls, which can have disastrous consequences. There are also unresolved issues concerning copyright, as AI requires a vast amount of data for training purposes. Experts and critics disagree on what constitutes fair use and whether AI companies should compensate original authors for using copyrighted material. Legislation can provide clarity and establish a smooth path for AI development.

In the meantime, companies can take steps to establish best practices for AI use. One important step is to upskill employees. Training and educating employees about AI and its risks are crucial to responsible usage. Internal company data should be handled with caution, as evidenced by Samsung's ban on using ChatGPT after a leak of sensitive code. Educating employees on proper AI usage and data protection is essential.

Using internal AI models instead of widely available options can help protect data. Internalizing the architecture ensures that data remains segregated, unlike when using external options like ChatGPT or Google Gemini. Internal models also offer customization options, allowing companies to tailor the model to their specific needs.

Addressing bias is another critical aspect of responsible AI usage. AI has the potential to perpetuate racial and gender biases based on the data used for training. Companies must ensure that their training data includes diversity to prevent biases from creeping into their models. Regular tests should be conducted to identify and rectify any biases that may arise.

Continuous evaluation is essential in AI usage. As technology and legislation evolve, organizations need to regularly assess and adjust their AI practices. This includes making adjustments to training data, access policies, and regulatory compliance.

While AI legislation is being developed in various jurisdictions, the field is still largely unregulated. Companies must take the responsibility to self-regulate and follow best practices to protect themselves and their customers. Until regulation catches up with reality, it is crucial for organizations to stay vigilant and adapt their AI practices accordingly.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/03/25/netflix-is-in-a-bind-with-3-body-problem-season-2/,Netflix Is In A Bind With ‘3 Body Problem’ Season 2,"Netflix recently released its highly anticipated sci-fi series, 3 Body Problem, which has quickly climbed to the number two spot on the top 10 list in the US. However, fans of the show are left hanging with a major cliffhanger at the end of the first season, raising questions about the possibility of a second season. As it is Netflix we're talking about, there are several factors to consider.

Based on Cixin Liu's acclaimed book trilogy, The Three-Body Problem, the show aims to bring together the three interconnected stories of the trilogy: The Three-Body Problem, The Dark Forest, and Death's End. This means that committing to the first season of the show implies a commitment to three seasons overall. Unfortunately, Netflix did not announce this ahead of time, leaving fans uncertain about the show's future.

For Netflix, this is a significant project, as the streaming service doesn't typically invest in high-profile and expensive sci-fi ventures due to the inherent risks involved. Aside from Stranger Things, Netflix has mostly left sci-fi to Apple TV+. However, given the book's acclaim and the involvement of David Benioff and DB Weiss, the creators of Game of Thrones, expectations are high for 3 Body Problem.

Reception for the show has been mixed. Critics have given it a 76% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, which is decent but not outstanding. User scores, on the other hand, have been less favorable, with a 64% rating. In comparison, other shows like Shogun on Hulu and X-Men 97 have received much higher scores. Ultimately, audience reception is what matters most.

It's worth noting that 3 Body Problem debuted behind Homicide New York, a true crime show, on Netflix's US Top 10 list. A strong show usually makes an immediate impact by debuting at number one, but 3 Body Problem's complex concepts may make it less likely to generate viral recommendations. Furthermore, its high production costs may pose a challenge for renewal unless it performs exceptionally well.

Netflix finds itself in a difficult position with this show. While it is an important project with high-profile talent attached, including the Game of Thrones duo, the lukewarm reception suggests that the streaming service will need to carefully consider its commitment to the series.

Update: As of March 25th, 3 Body Problem has reached the number one spot on Netflix's Top 10 list, which bodes well for the possibility of a second season. However, actual viewership numbers have yet to be released. In interviews, the creators have hinted at the potential for a second season, but nothing has been confirmed. David Benioff has expressed his enthusiasm for the trilogy, stating that the second book is even better than the first, and the third book is mind-blowing. The story becomes more ambitious as it progresses, making it an exciting prospect for future seasons.

Interestingly, it has been revealed that 3 Body Problem is Netflix's most expensive scripted series ever, with each episode costing $20 million. This comes as a surprise, considering the hefty price tag attached to the show. Weiss and Benioff's Netflix deal alone cost at least $200 million. While Netflix has canceled shows in the past after signing big deals with creators, they generally hesitate to do so. Given the clear three-book arc of the trilogy, it seems likely that Netflix will remain committed to the show. However, the high cost of production raises valid concerns about the financial viability of the entire trilogy.

In conclusion, Netflix appears to be heavily invested in 3 Body Problem, regardless of its performance. While the show may not have met expectations thus far, its growing popularity and potential for future seasons make it a project worth pursuing. Only time will tell how the show progresses and whether it can live up to its ambitious goals.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/apple-sued-microsofts-ai-ambitions-and-nvidia-surprises/,"Apple sued, Microsoft's AI ambitions and Nvidia's surprises","Welcome to this edition of Week in Review, where we bring you the latest news and updates in the tech industry. In this week's highlights, we have major news regarding Apple's antitrust lawsuit and Microsoft's AI ambitions. So, let's delve right in.

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has accused Apple of using monopolistic tactics to lock in iPhone users. Apple, on the other hand, argues that the DOJ's actions could potentially harm what its users love about its phones and ecosystem.

The lawsuit draws parallels between Apple and Microsoft in the 1990s. However, there are notable differences between the two companies and their strategies to retain customers. Despite this legal battle, experts predict that it may take several years for the lawsuit to reach a resolution.

Moving on to other news, Microsoft recently acquired the co-founders of Inflection AI, a prominent AI startup. Mustafa Suleyman will now lead Microsoft's consumer-facing unit for AI, while Karén Simonyan has been appointed as the EVP and CEO of the same group. Inflection AI had previously raised $1.3 billion, with Microsoft being one of its major investors.

Nvidia's GTC developer conference also made waves this week. CEO Jensen Huang surprised attendees with various announcements, including the prediction that artificial general intelligence is just five years away. Additionally, Nvidia unveiled a new AI platform called GR00T, designed for humanoid robots.

In the realm of collaboration, Google and Apple are reportedly in talks about deploying Google's AI model to power upcoming iOS updates. This raises questions about whether this collaboration is temporary or a long-term partnership, as Apple continues to develop its own AI capabilities.

On the topic of hacking and privacy, the Biden administration is leading an international effort to combat commercial spyware. Interestingly, some investors joining the cause were previously involved in the spyware business themselves.

In the gaming world, a recent hack disrupted a $5 million Apex Legends tournament. The hacker's intention was to showcase the exploit used, while also highlighting the need for developers to address such vulnerabilities.

Glassdoor, a popular platform for employee reviews, faced criticism as users discovered their real names added to their profiles without consent. The only solution offered to these users was to delete their accounts entirely.

Turning to funding and IPOs, Reddit's IPO had a successful start, with the stock price jumping 48% on its first day of trading. Astera Labs, a company specializing in connectivity hardware for cloud computing data centers, also experienced a 72% increase in stock price on its first day.

Lastly, The Browser Company, the startup behind the Arc browser, raised $50 million in funding. The company aims to replace PCs with browsers but faces uncertainty regarding its path to monetization.

In our bonus round, we explore why AI often struggles with spelling, despite its potential. We also discuss Fisker's production pause due to financial difficulties and why it's crucial to review systems like ChatGPT and Gemini, even though they are inherently difficult to assess.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/gostudent-tutoring-profitability/,"GoStudent, the online learning platform, says it's now profitable","GoStudent, the online tutoring marketplace based in Vienna, Austria, has become one of the leading startups in the country, valued at $3.2 billion. With 11 million families and 23,000 tutors on its platform, GoStudent has now achieved profitability. According to CEO Felix Ohswald, the company is not only EBITDA profitable but also has positive operating cash flow. This milestone places GoStudent among the few Austrian startups to gain international recognition in the tech industry.

However, GoStudent's path to profitability was not without challenges. Like many technology companies, it experienced a market crash during the boom in online learning and remote experiences. Cash burn became a significant issue, and customer demand dropped sharply, leading to a critical situation. In 2021, GoStudent lost €89 million, which increased to €220 million in 2022. As a result, the company had to implement several rounds of layoffs and make major cost cuts.

GoStudent's rapid growth from 2019 to 2022 was accompanied by significant cash burn, totaling over €150 million in 2022 alone. Despite raising significant funding, the company realized it needed to change its approach. In 2023, GoStudent reduced its burn rate by 70%, but it was still not enough. The company underwent restructurings and layoffs to find a way to continue growing while spending less. These experiences taught GoStudent valuable lessons about scaling and prioritizing key factors for success.

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the digital transformation, particularly in the field of education technology (edtech). GoStudent benefited from this trend, transitioning from having to convince parents about the merits of online tutoring to becoming the go-to solution for students in need of educational assistance. However, despite the favorable market conditions, GoStudent needed to address its cash burn issue to ensure long-term sustainability.

To reduce costs, GoStudent made several adjustments. It cut back on extravagant parties, paused acquisitions, and refrained from expanding into markets where online tutoring was not well-established. The company also exited the U.S. market shortly after entering, recognizing the high competition and the need to focus on more feasible opportunities. GoStudent now aims to concentrate on Europe and adopt a more organic growth strategy outside of German-speaking countries.

While GoStudent's mission is to become the number one global school and unlock the potential of every student through personalized tutoring, achieving this goal while controlling costs will be challenging. The company currently offers tutoring rather than teaching, but its acquisition of StudienKreis in 2022 indicates a shift toward hybrid learning. StudienKreis, founded in 1974, has 1,000 physical learning centers primarily in Germany. GoStudent plans to leverage these centers and technology to provide a hybrid education model.

GoStudent believes that the future of education is hybrid and emphasizes the importance of a ""glocal"" approach. While education curricula are typically national or regional, GoStudent aims to use technology to connect students with the right tutors regardless of location. Most of GoStudent's tutors are university students, which facilitates a connection with pupils while providing quality service.

In conclusion, GoStudent's journey to profitability highlights the challenges faced by technology companies in a rapidly evolving market. By implementing cost-cutting measures and focusing on organic growth, the company has successfully turned its fortunes around. With its mission to revolutionize education through personalized tutoring and hybrid learning, GoStudent is poised to make a lasting impact in the edtech industry.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Founders-of-GoStudent-Gregor-Muller-I-Felix-Ohswald-2.jpg?w=1024,2024-03-25 11:00:36,Innovation,Innovation
