They have developed a multifunctional additive that improves the efficiency and stability of inverted PSCs.

Perovskite solar cells have garnered attention in recent years due to their exceptional optoelectronic properties and low fabrication cost. They hold promise for large-scale production. However, the commercialization of PSCs has been hindered by their relatively low power conversion efficiency (PCE) and poor long-term stability.

To overcome these challenges, Prof. Ge Ziyi's team used a novel additive called potassium (4-tert-butoxycarbonylpiperazin-1-yl) methyl trifluoroborate (PTFBK). By incorporating PTFBK into the perovskite precursor solution, they were able to passivate defects and enhance carrier transport in the perovskite films.

The introduction of PTFBK had multiple positive effects on the perovskite films. It not only passivated defects but also improved the extraction of carriers, resulting in higher-quality perovskite films with larger grain size. This, in turn, led to increased power conversion efficiency.

The researchers achieved impressive results using PTFBK. They obtained highly efficient rigid and flexible inverted PSCs with power conversion efficiencies of 24.99% and 23.48%, respectively. These values represent a significant improvement over previous records.

Additionally, the PTFBK-modified devices demonstrated excellent thermal, humidity, and light stability under various conditions. They remained stable even when subjected to continuous heating at 85Â°C in nitrogen-filled containers, ambient conditions with 60-70% relative humidity, and continuous illumination at 100 mW cm-2. This stability is crucial for the practical application of PSCs.

Furthermore, the flexible PSCs developed by Prof. Ge Ziyi's team showed remarkable bending stability. After 5,000 bending cycles at a radius of 5 mm, they retained 85% of their initial power conversion efficiency. This indicates that the PTFBK-modified flexible PSCs have great potential for use in flexible and wearable electronics.

The findings of this study pave the way for the future development and commercialization of perovskite solar cells and related photovoltaic technologies. The use of the multifunctional additive PTFBK has proven to be a promising approach to improving the efficiency and stability of PSCs. With further research and optimization, perovskite solar cells may become a key player in the renewable energy sector.

In conclusion, Prof. Ge Ziyi's team at NIMTE has made significant strides in enhancing the performance and stability of inverted perovskite solar cells. Their use of the multifunctional additive PTFBK has demonstrated improved power conversion efficiency and long-term stability. This research opens up new possibilities for the future development and commercialization of perovskite solar cells and related technologies.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/novel-multifunctional.jpg,2024-03-26 09:20:01,Innovation,Innovation
