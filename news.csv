While we wait for spring to truly arrive, let's talk about the upcoming PlayStation Plus lineup for next month. But before we dive into that, don't forget that you still have a few days left to grab this month's lineup, which offers a great selection of four diverse games. Personally, I'm thrilled that one of my long-standing predictions, the kung fu action game Sifu, has finally come true. Let's see if any of my other predictions (listed below) will also materialize in April.

PlayStation Plus, or PS Plus, is Sony's monthly membership program that provides access to online gaming. It's important to note that PS Plus is not required for streaming movies or TV shows on platforms like Netflix, nor is it necessary for playing free-to-play games such as Warzone or Fortnite. However, any paid online games will require a subscription.

Within the PS Plus program, there are three tiers: Essential, Extra, and Premium. For the purpose of this post, we will focus solely on the free monthly games included in the Essential tier. Following a recent price increase, the costs for the different tiers are as follows: PS Plus Essential - $79.99/year, PS Plus Extra - $134.99/year, and PS Plus Premium - $159.99/year.

Now let's talk about when Sony will reveal the lineup for next month's PS Plus games. Typically, Sony announces the upcoming games on the last Wednesday of the current month. However, there may be exceptions to this rule. The new games are always released on the first Tuesday of the month, and their details are revealed the previous Wednesday. Therefore, we can expect an announcement for April's lineup on the morning of Wednesday, March 27th, with the new games becoming available on Tuesday, April 2nd.

As of now, there haven't been any leaks or rumors about the essential games for April. I have scoured the internet for clues but have come up empty-handed. Since there are no games scheduled for release on April 2nd, we can safely assume that it won't be a brand new title. If any leaks do emerge between now and Wednesday morning, I will promptly update this post. In the meantime, here is my slightly truncated list of predictions, although I must admit that some are more wishful thinking than others. It's also possible that we may see a Simulator or sports game in the mix.

Without further ado, here are my predictions/wishful thinking titles for the April PlayStation Plus lineup:

1. Assassin's Creed Valhalla
2. Need For Speed Unbound
3. The Outer Worlds
4. Forspoken
5. Demon's Souls
6. The Order 1886
7. The Last Of Us Part 1
8. LEGO Jurassic World
9. Marvel's Midnight Suns
10. Tales of Arise
11. Cult Of The Lamb
12. Little Nightmares 2
13. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor
14. Nier: Automata
15. Elden Ring
16. Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice
17. Metal: Hellsinger
18. Donut County
19. Dead Island 2
20. Metro Exodus
21. Gollum
22. Skull Island: Rise Of Kong
23. The Walking Dead: Destinies

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have both experienced incredible growth in recent years, and there are many similarities between the two companies. Both emerged from unexpected opportunities in their core businesses. AWS realized it could sell its internal services to others, while Nvidia discovered that its gaming GPU was well-suited for AI workloads.

Nvidia's revenue has been growing rapidly, reaching $22.1 billion in Q4 2024 from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024. However, most of this growth comes from the company's data center business. On the other hand, AWS has consistently been a major revenue driver for Amazon, but its growth has started to slow down.

Both companies benefited from being in the right place at the right time. As web apps and mobile became popular, the cloud provided on-demand resources, and enterprises saw the value of moving workloads to the cloud. Similarly, the rise of AI and large language models coincided with the increased use of GPUs for processing these workloads.

While AWS has become a highly successful business, its growth has begun to decline. Nvidia, on the other hand, is experiencing astronomical revenue growth and is expected to continue scaling its revenue past the $100 billion annual run rate mark. Analysts predict that Nvidia will generate $110.5 billion in revenue in its current fiscal year, up over 81% from the previous year. However, growth rates are expected to slow down in the future.

Despite competition from other chipmakers like AMD and Intel, Nvidia remains firmly in control of the market. It dominates the chip market, but AMD is gaining ground at the board level. Nvidia's success is largely due to its strong position in the AI market.

In conclusion, Nvidia has the potential to become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS. Its revenue growth has been impressive, and analysts predict continued growth in the coming years. While competition may increase, Nvidia's market dominance and strong position in AI give it an advantage. The future looks promising for Nvidia as it continues to ride the wave of AI innovation.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/24/samsung-s24-ultra-s23-free-update-warning-for-galaxy-android-users/,Samsung Issues Critical Update For Millions Of Galaxy Users,"If you own a Samsung Galaxy device, it's crucial that you check for and install a critical update as soon as it becomes available. Additionally, you should prepare yourself for a significant change that will soon be coming to your device. Trust us, you won't want to miss out on this!

Samsung has been diligently rolling out its March security update, ensuring that both premium and budget models are covered. Recently, carrier-unlocked S21 FE devices in the US were added to the list of eligible devices. Over the past couple of weeks, various versions of S24s, S23s, and S22s received the update first, followed by older and budget models. It is essential that you download and install the new software as soon as it becomes available for your specific network and model.

To check if your device is eligible for the monthly update, you can visit this link.

Among the numerous fixes included in the update are patches for a couple of high-risk vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could potentially allow malware to take over and control your device to some extent. So it's crucial that you prioritize downloading and installing the update to protect your device from these risks.

But the availability of the March update isn't the most significant news of the week. Samsung has finally joined Google's seamless update roadshow after years of resistance. Instead of going through the traditional process of downloading, installing, and rebooting for every update, the new system downloads and installs updates in the background to a secondary partition on the device. The device then reboots from that partition during the next restart, making it the primary partition. The previous partition remains inactive until the next update. This significantly reduces the amount of time your device is unusable during the update process, with most of the work happening in the background.

According to Google, this A/B system update, also known as a seamless update, ensures that a functional booting system remains on the disk during an over-the-air (OTA) update. This reduces the chances of ending up with an inactive device after an update, resulting in fewer device replacements and repairs.

You can identify if a seamless update is being installed by looking for two progress bars—one for the download/install process and the other for verification. The Galaxy A55 has been the guinea pig for Samsung's initial seamless update, but it is expected that this feature will roll out to a wider range of devices in the upcoming months. We eagerly wait to see which devices will be next in line for this update.

However, it remains to be seen whether this update will be extended to all Samsung models. If there's one thing we've learned from Samsung updates, it's that they can be complex and require consulting checklists to understand what, when, and for how long updates will be available.

So why has Samsung waited until now to adopt seamless updates? It's possible that they were pushed to do so rather than making the decision independently. A recent comment from the Android Open Source Project hinted at the removal of the legacy alternative to seamless updates after eight years of parallel operation.

Given that seamless updates were introduced in 2016, Samsung's delay has become quite notorious. While this delay has been a thorn in the side of the Android project, it's important to note that there can be no Android without Samsung. Therefore, it's safe to assume that there were numerous discussions behind the scenes before this decision was made. However, as updates tend to be shrouded in mystery, we still don't know what the wider approach will be going forward.

While seamless updates may shorten the update process to just a minute or two of reboot time when the device is unusable, it won't necessarily simplify the Samsung and Android update combination each month. This combination still needs to be deployed across the diverse range of Samsung devices.

Nevertheless, the implementation of seamless updates removes the need for user action. As Google explains, ""Because A/B updates happen in the background, they are no longer user-initiated. To avoid disrupting users, it is recommended that updates are scheduled when the device is in idle maintenance mode, such as overnight, and on Wi-Fi.""

While Samsung's approach is still far from Apple's streamlined process, it does bring us a step closer. As iPhones and Android devices continue to resemble each other more and more, it's possible that we will see further improvements in the future. Only time will tell.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65b9d23fb7b46f6467a28780/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2366,1280,x313,y135,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 22:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/techcrunch-mobility-the-wheels-are-starting-to-come-off-the-fisker-ev-bus/,TechCrunch Mobility: The wheels are starting to come off the Fisker EV bus,"TechCrunch Mobility is a weekly newsletter that covers all things related to transportation. In this edition, we'll be discussing recent developments in the automotive industry, including proposed regulations from the Biden Administration, EV startups, and other news in the mobility sector.

The Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have released two separate proposed standards that will impact U.S. automakers and consumers. While the regulations have been softened to accommodate the industry, they still impose stricter standards compared to the previous ones.

The DOE's proposed standard introduces a ""petroleum equivalency factor"" that assigns a score to electric vehicles (EVs) under the government's corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. The original proposal would have made it challenging for automakers to meet the CAFE standards, resulting in hefty fines. However, the new proposal provides more flexibility for compliance.

On the other hand, the EPA's tailpipe standards for 2027 to 2032 model year cars and light-duty trucks impose more stringent requirements on automakers. However, the standards are technology agnostic, allowing automakers to meet them through various powertrain options. This is a departure from the original proposal, which mandated a significant portion of EV sales by 2032.

While these regulations have minimal impact on EV startups like Rivian, Tesla, and Lucid, legacy automakers face challenges as they invest in EV development while still profiting from internal combustion engine vehicles. Plug-in hybrids may benefit from these regulations.

In other news, Clevon, a company specializing in autonomous delivery technology, has faced financial difficulties. However, it has entered into an exclusivity agreement for a merger with an American electric vehicle company. The deal is expected to be finalized by June.

Uber has made its first investment in an Africa-founded startup, Moove. Moove offers vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers in Africa and has raised $100 million in a Series B funding round led by Uber. This investment aligns with Uber's commitment to a fully zero-emission fleet by 2040.

Additionally, Amber, a Bay Area startup, has raised $3.18 million in a seed round for its aftermarket Tesla extended warranty product. Candela, an electric boat maker, has raised $25 million in funding, and Pelikan Mobility, a French startup, has secured funding for its mobility solutions.

These are just a few highlights from the latest edition of TechCrunch Mobility. Stay tuned for more news and insights on the future of transportation.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1363022906.jpg?resize=1200,730",2024-03-24 19:00:33,Innovation,Innovation
