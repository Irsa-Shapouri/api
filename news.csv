https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-vulnerability-virtual-reality.html,Vulnerability in virtual reality systems identified,"Virtual reality (VR) systems have opened up a world of possibilities, allowing users to immerse themselves in a virtual environment. However, a team of computer scientists from the University of Chicago has discovered a potential vulnerability in VR systems that could be exploited by hackers. This vulnerability involves the insertion of an ""inception layer"" between a user's VR Home Screen and their VR User/Server. The team has detailed their findings in a paper published on the arXiv preprint server.

Imagine a scenario where hackers add an app to a user's VR headset, tricking them into revealing sensitive information. This is the premise behind the researchers' work. The app would create a layer between the user and the virtual world they see in their VR device. Drawing inspiration from the movie ""Inception,"" where a character has an altered reality downloaded into their brain, the researchers refer to this layer as the inception layer.

The potential consequences of such an inception layer are significant. Hackers could record information, such as passcodes entered into virtual ATMs, intercept and modify transaction details, or even manipulate the VR world itself. By adding characters representing friends or family, hackers could deceive users and gain their trust or access to confidential information. Essentially, the app could monitor or manipulate gestures, voice commands, browsing activity, and social or business interactions.

To test the feasibility of this vulnerability, the researchers enlisted the help of 28 volunteers who played a game using a demonstration VR headset. They then downloaded an app onto the devices, simulating a hacking scenario. Although the download process caused a slight flickering effect, only 10 of the volunteers noticed it, and only one questioned whether something nefarious was happening.

Upon discovering this vulnerability, the research team promptly notified Meta, the company behind the Meta Quest VR system used in the experiment. Meta responded by expressing their intention to investigate the potential vulnerability and resolve it if confirmed. It is worth noting that similar vulnerabilities may exist in other VR systems and apps that attempt to insert themselves between users and their VR devices.

The implications of this research are significant. As VR technology becomes more widespread, it is crucial to address potential security flaws that could compromise user privacy and safety. By raising awareness of this vulnerability, the research team aims to encourage VR system developers to enhance their security measures and protect users from potential attacks.

In conclusion, the University of Chicago computer science team has identified a potential vulnerability in VR systems, which they refer to as inception attacks. This vulnerability involves the insertion of an inception layer between a user's VR Home Screen and their VR User/Server, enabling hackers to manipulate and monitor user interactions. The researchers conducted an experiment to validate their findings, and upon discovery, they promptly informed Meta, the company responsible for the Meta Quest VR system. It is essential for VR system developers to address this vulnerability and bolster security measures to ensure user privacy and safety in the rapidly evolving field of virtual reality.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/vulnerability-in-virtu.jpg,2024-03-25 10:20:02,Innovation,Innovation

Here's the good, the bad, and the ugly","DevOps engineering is a highly sought-after job in today's economy. However, it requires a combination of technical expertise and business acumen. In order to thrive in this role, continuous learning is essential as the industry evolves rapidly.

DevOps engineers are in high demand as they oversee the automation and collaboration of both cloud and on-premises environments to ensure the seamless development and deployment of software. This job offers attractive salaries, with an average of $134,000 per year in the US, according to Talent.com.

Seasoned DevOps engineer, Brad Morgan, emphasizes the importance of understanding foundational technology. He highlights the significance of learning Linux, as it is integral to any modern DevOps role. A strong background in Linux, familiarity with the terminal, and knowledge of basic commands are essential skills for success.

In addition to Linux, bash scripting is another crucial skill for DevOps engineers. Automation through bash scripting is widely used in the DevOps world, especially in building pipelines. It is important to master this skill to streamline processes and enhance efficiency.

Cloud skills are also vital for DevOps engineers. Familiarity with mainstream providers like AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure can open doors to more opportunities. Morgan recommends focusing on one cloud vendor at a time, becoming a master of one before moving on to others.

Becoming a DevOps engineer does not require a formal course of study. Self-learning is the key to pursuing a career in this field. Constant learning and personal growth are crucial in keeping up with the ever-evolving DevOps ecosystem. Tools and frameworks that were popular yesterday may be replaced by new alternatives, making continuous learning a necessity.

""Homebrew Henry,"" another experienced DevOps engineer, echoes the sentiment of constant learning. He emphasizes that the pace of development and the introduction of AI tools like ChatGPT will continuously reshape the field of DevOps engineering.

Infrastructure management is a significant aspect of the job. DevOps engineers spend a considerable amount of time setting up, configuring, and maintaining cloud infrastructure. This involves dealing with servers, databases, networks, and security on a daily basis. Passion for managing infrastructure is essential for success in this role.

On the other hand, if you lean more towards software engineering, DevOps may not fulfill your coding itch. Writing Terraforms, CI/CD pipelines, and automation scripts may not provide the same satisfaction as building customer-facing applications. However, it is worth noting that there are plenty of examples of people transitioning between software engineering and DevOps roles.

It is important to consider the business side of DevOps as well. Unrealistic expectations often surround the role, with businesses hoping to solve all their problems by hiring a few engineers. Management may overlook the complexities and challenges that come with DevOps. Therefore, it is crucial to communicate effectively with stakeholders and manage expectations.

In conclusion, DevOps engineering is a dynamic and rewarding field that requires a combination of technical skills, continuous learning, and business understanding. With the right mindset and dedication to personal growth, DevOps engineers can navigate the ever-evolving landscape and contribute to the success of their organizations.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/e4d3d8d263eb00323161fcf2566ad35a3fe52282/2024/03/25/1b8b924e-2629-43c2-b416-1b990e262786/gettyimages-1319039490.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-liquid-iron-battery-grid-energy.html,New all-liquid iron flow battery for grid energy storage,"Flow batteries holds great potential for large-scale energy storage and the integration of renewable energy sources into the electric grid. Researchers at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have developed a new battery design that uses a common chemical found in water treatment facilities to create a safe, economical, and water-based flow battery using Earth-abundant materials.

The team's lab-scale, iron-based flow battery demonstrated impressive cycling stability, maintaining 98.7% of its maximum capacity over one thousand charging cycles. This is a significant improvement compared to previous iron-based batteries, which experienced degradation of charge capacity over fewer charging cycles.

What sets this battery apart is its unique liquid chemical formula that combines charged iron with a neutral-pH phosphate-based liquid electrolyte. The key ingredient in this formula is nitrogenous triphosphonate, nitrilotri-methylphosphonic acid (NTMPA), which is readily available in industrial quantities due to its use in inhibiting corrosion in water treatment plants.

NTMPA belongs to a chemical family called phosphonates, which are based on the element phosphorus. Phosphonates are known for their ability to dissolve well in water and their non-toxic properties. They are commonly used in fertilizers, detergents, and other applications.

Flow batteries operate by storing energy in chemical bonds within two chambers filled with different liquids. The batteries charge through an electrochemical reaction and release energy when connected to an external circuit. Unlike conventional batteries, flow batteries have two external supply tanks of liquid that constantly circulate through them, serving as the battery system's ""blood supply."" The larger the electrolyte supply tank, the more energy the flow battery can store.

Flow batteries have the advantage of being able to be built at any scale, from small lab-scale systems to large installations that can power entire cities. They can serve as backup generators for the electric grid and are an essential part of decarbonization strategies that aim to store energy from renewable sources.

One of the advantages of the aqueous iron-based flow battery developed by the researchers is its ability to operate in water at neutral pH. This makes it a safer option for grid operators, particularly in urban or suburban areas near energy consumers where safety concerns are paramount. The use of commercially available reagents that have not been previously explored for flow batteries further adds to the system's advantages.

Although the initial design of the battery has a lower energy density compared to commercialized vanadium-based systems, it still holds promise. The team achieved an energy density of up to 9 watt-hours per liter (Wh/L), while vanadium-based systems reach over 25 Wh/L. However, by using Earth-abundant materials, the battery can be scaled up to provide the same energy output as higher energy density systems.

The development of flow batteries like this one is crucial for modernizing the U.S. electric grid and effectively storing energy from renewable sources such as wind and solar power. The use of water-based, flow batteries with Earth-abundant materials offers a viable solution for large-scale energy storage that is safe, economical, and sustainable.

As research into flow batteries continues, there is potential for further improvements in energy density and other performance metrics. The ability to harness renewable energy sources and store energy efficiently will play a vital role in transitioning to a clean and sustainable energy future. The work done by the researchers at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is a significant step in that direction.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/new-all-liquid-iron-fl.jpg,2024-03-25 07:22:25,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobinglis/2024/03/25/avoiding-the-judgment-of-history/,Avoiding The Judgment Of History,"Art Laffer, a prominent economist and former advisor to President Ronald Reagan, recently held discussions with former President Trump regarding the potential replacement of Jerome Powell as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Additionally, Laffer has been a vocal advocate for a revenue-neutral carbon tax as an effective market-based solution to combat climate change.

In response to climate skeptics, Kim Beazley, Australia's former ambassador to the US, emphasizes the importance of leaving a record of one's stance on climate change for future generations. Beazley wants his children and grandchildren to know where he stood on this critical issue.

Recently, the US House of Representatives passed a non-binding resolution condemning a carbon tax, despite the fact that carbon pricing is widely viewed as one of the most powerful tools for addressing climate change. The resolution was put forth by Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana and has been previously offered by Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana.

However, those who oppose a carbon tax seem to overlook two crucial aspects of a well-designed carbon tax. Firstly, it can be made revenue-neutral by offsetting it with a reduction in an existing tax, thereby preventing any growth in the size of government. Secondly, a carbon tax can be made border-adjustable by applying the tax to imports from countries that have not implemented their own pollution taxes.

Interestingly, during the same week that the House passed the carbon tax resolution, reports emerged of Art Laffer discussing the possibility of replacing Jerome Powell as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board with President Trump. Furthermore, there was speculation about Kevin Hassett also being considered for the position. Both Laffer and Hassett have expressed support for addressing climate change through a carbon tax that is accompanied by a dollar-for-dollar reduction in existing taxes.

Both Laffer and Hassett draw inspiration from Arthur Cecil Pigou, an influential English economist who lived from 1877 to 1959. They are members of the Pigou Club, founded by Harvard economist Greg Mankiw, who served as Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush.

Pigou advocated for taxing activities that society wishes to discourage while reducing taxes on activities that society wants to encourage. For instance, society wants to increase income and reduce pollution. Those who voted in favor of the carbon tax resolution should be questioned about their objections to such a tax swap. Were they primarily concerned that a carbon tax would disproportionately impact low-income individuals? What if we reduced taxes on payroll income and instead taxed carbon pollution? This tax swap would specifically address the regressive nature of a standalone carbon tax. Contrary to the claims made in the resolution, low-wage workers would not be negatively affected. Furthermore, the economy-wide expansion of the tax base could provide additional support to Social Security, which relies on payroll taxes.

The authors of the carbon tax resolution also appear to be unaware that, under existing World Trade Organization rules, the US could apply its carbon tax to imports from countries that do not have their own carbon tax. This approach, known as a border adjustment, would prompt other countries to adopt their own carbon pollution fees in order to protect their own interests. Consequently, the true costs associated with burning fossil fuels would be reflected in the prices of products. As a result, environmentally friendly products would become more affordable relative to those that are environmentally harmful.

This solution would undoubtedly make Pigou proud, as he argued that negative externalities, which are costs imposed on society by firms and individuals, create market distortions that hinder innovation. If a company can freely pollute the environment without consequence, it can offer its products at a lower cost than its competitors who have invested in cleaner and more sustainable processes. While some may argue for stricter regulations, Milton Friedman, an esteemed economist and one of President Reagan's advisors, suggested that taxing such activities would be a more effective approach. This sentiment was expressed by Friedman during a two-minute clip from the Phil Donahue Show in the 1980s.

Ultimately, history will judge the decisions made by politicians on both sides of the aisle. Democrats who voted in favor of the carbon tax resolution in favor of political expediency rather than sound policy also face scrutiny. Fortunately, the non-binding nature of the resolution allows for rectification, and redemption is always possible.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6601d28de733bba2fcac676c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 15:47:48,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2024/03/25/amid-fintech-slowdown-goldman-sachs-backed-startup-considers-sale-sources-say/,"Amid Fintech Slowdown, Goldman Sachs-Backed Startup Considers Sale","Deserve, a Silicon Valley startup that specializes in helping companies launch and manage credit cards, is facing challenges due to a slowdown in business and a difficult funding market. The company, which is backed by investors such as Goldman Sachs, Visa, Mastercard, and Accel, has reportedly considered selling itself amidst the turmoil in the crypto industry. However, the company's founder and CEO, Kalpesh Kapadia, has denied these rumors, stating that the company is not for sale. Deserve has raised $150 million in equity funding since its founding in 2013 but has yet to turn a profit. Despite these challenges, Kapadia remains optimistic about the company's future, expecting strong growth in the coming year.

Deserve initially aimed to be a consumer credit card company that focused on serving underserved populations, such as immigrants and students. However, breaking into the consumer lending industry proved to be difficult and capital-intensive. In 2018, the company shifted its focus to helping other companies launch credit cards, with student loan bank Sallie Mae becoming its first customer. Deserve now offers a range of services to make the credit card launch process easier for its customers, including risk assessment, transaction processing, customer service, and dispute resolution.

Deserve's pivot to serving other companies has been successful, with notable customers like the University of Notre Dame and small fintech startup Vertical Finance. However, the company still maintains its original consumer card business and continues to collect fees and interest income. In the past, Deserve had expressed interest in working with crypto lenders to issue credit cards. BlockFi, a crypto lender, became Deserve's largest customer but later went bankrupt, resulting in a significant loss of revenue for the company.

In addition to the challenges posed by the crypto industry, Deserve has also faced difficulties due to the struggles of its fintech customers. As interest rates rise and the startup funding market becomes more challenging, many fintech companies have struggled to survive. Deserve has had 15 customers over the past year, half of which are fintech companies and the other half are banks.

Despite these challenges, Deserve remains committed to its mission of providing financial infrastructure for card programs. The company aims to achieve profitability and sustainable growth in the future. While the possibility of a sale looms, Deserve's founder and CEO is focused on strategic discussions around partnerships, investment, and mergers and acquisitions.

In conclusion, Deserve, a Silicon Valley startup in the credit card management industry, is facing challenges due to a slowdown in business and a difficult funding market. The company, which is backed by high-profile investors, has considered selling itself but denies the rumors. Deserve has successfully pivoted to helping other companies launch credit cards and continues to collect fees and interest income from its original consumer card business. Despite setbacks with crypto lenders and struggling fintech customers, Deserve remains optimistic about its future and aims to achieve profitability and sustainable growth.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600d053afe6bed0f9b925c9/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 11:57:06,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-household-robots-common.html,Engineering household robots to have a little common sense,"Robots are becoming increasingly proficient at performing household tasks, from cleaning spills to serving food. Many robots learn these tasks through imitation, where they copy the motions guided by a human. However, robots often struggle to handle unexpected disruptions or adjust to slight bumps and nudges unless explicitly programmed to do so. To address this issue, engineers at MIT have developed a new method that combines robot motion data with the ""common sense knowledge"" of large language models (LLMs).

The MIT engineers' approach allows robots to logically break down complex tasks into subtasks and adapt to disruptions within those subtasks. This enables robots to continue their tasks without starting from scratch or requiring explicit programming for every possible failure. Yanwei Wang, a graduate student at MIT, explains that blindly mimicking a human's motion trajectories can lead to errors accumulating and derailing the robot's execution. With their method, robots can self-correct errors and improve overall task success.

The researchers present their approach in a study that will be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024). The study's co-authors include graduate students Tsun-Hsuan Wang and Jiayuan Mao, postdoc Michael Hagenow, and Professor Julie Shah.

To illustrate their approach, the researchers use the example of scooping marbles from one bowl and pouring them into another. Traditionally, engineers would demonstrate the task to the robot by moving it through the motions of scooping and pouring in one continuous trajectory. However, the researchers realized that tasks like this consist of a sequence of subtasks, such as reaching into the bowl, scooping, and pouring. If a robot makes a mistake during any of these subtasks, it would typically have to start over unless explicitly programmed to recover from failures.

Manually planning and programming each subtask can be tedious. Instead, the researchers found that language models can help automate some of this work. Language models process vast amounts of text and can generate sentences based on learned connections between words, sentences, and paragraphs. In this case, the researchers found that language models could produce a logical list of subtasks for a given task. For example, if asked to list the actions involved in scooping marbles, the language model might generate a sequence of verbs like ""reach,"" ""scoop,"" ""transport,"" and ""pour.""

The researchers developed an algorithm to connect the language model's subtask labels with the robot's position in physical space or an image that represents the robot's state. This process, known as ""grounding,"" allows the robot to understand its stage in the task and autonomously replan and recover. By mapping the robot's physical coordinates or image to the language model's labels, the robot gains a better understanding of its actions.

This new approach has promising implications for improving the performance of household robots. It reduces the need for explicit programming and enables robots to adapt to disruptions, ultimately improving overall task success. The combination of robot motion data and language models provides robots with the ability to self-correct errors and make adjustments on their own. This research paves the way for more advanced and adaptable household robots in the future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/engineering-household.jpg,2024-03-25 09:48:20,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-large-language-simple-mechanism-knowledge.html,Large language models use a surprisingly simple mechanism to retrieve some stored knowledge,"Large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools used in various fields such as customer support, code generation, and language translation. Despite their widespread use, scientists still have limited understanding of how these complex models work. To gain insight into their inner workings, researchers at MIT and other institutions examined how LLMs retrieve stored knowledge.

Their findings revealed a surprising discovery: LLMs often utilize a simple linear function to retrieve and decode stored facts. These linear functions, which involve two variables and no exponents, capture the direct relationship between the variables. What's more, the same decoding function is used for similar types of facts.

By identifying linear functions for different facts, researchers can probe the model to uncover its knowledge about new subjects and determine where that knowledge is stored within the model. They developed a technique to estimate these simple functions and found that even when a model provides an incorrect answer, it often retains the correct information. This approach could potentially be used to identify and correct falsehoods within the model, reducing its tendency to produce incorrect or nonsensical responses.

The lead authors of the paper detailing these findings are Evan Hernandez, a graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science (EECS) at MIT, and Arnab Sharma, a graduate student in computer science at Northeastern University. The research was conducted in collaboration with other researchers from MIT, Harvard University, and the Israeli Institute of Technology. The findings will be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024) in Vienna.

Large language models, also known as transformer models, are neural networks that consist of billions of interconnected nodes or neurons organized into layers. These models encode and process data, with much of the knowledge being represented as relations connecting subjects and objects. For example, the relation ""Miles Davis plays the trumpet"" connects Miles Davis to the trumpet.

As a transformer model acquires more knowledge, it stores additional facts about a particular subject across multiple layers. When a user queries the model about that subject, it must decode the most relevant fact to provide an accurate response. Understanding how the model retrieves this information was the focus of the researchers' investigation.

Through a series of experiments, the researchers discovered that despite their complexity, LLMs use a simple linear function to decode relational information. Each decoding function is specific to the type of fact being retrieved. For instance, one function is used to output the instrument a person plays, while another function is used to output the state where a person was born.

The researchers developed a method to estimate these simple functions and computed functions for various relations, such as the ""capital city of a country"" and the ""lead singer of a band."" While there are countless possible relations, the researchers focused on this subset as they are representative of the types of facts that can be expressed in this manner.

To test the functions, the researchers altered the subject and examined whether the correct object information could still be retrieved. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the linear functions in retrieving and decoding stored facts.

This research sheds light on the internal mechanisms of large language models and provides valuable insights into how they retrieve and utilize stored knowledge. The discovery of these simple linear functions opens up possibilities for further exploration and refinement of language models, potentially leading to improved accuracy and reduced instances of incorrect or nonsensical answers.

In conclusion, large language models have proven to be highly complex and challenging to understand. However, by investigating the mechanisms behind their knowledge retrieval processes, researchers have discovered the use of simple linear functions. This finding has significant implications for the field of natural language processing and offers opportunities for future advancements in language model development.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/large-language-models-2.jpg,2024-03-25 09:34:06,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-strategy-suppress-strain-propagation-ultrahigh.html,A strategy to suppress strain propagation in ultrahigh-Ni cathodes during fast charging,"To support the increasing demand for the electronics industry and the widespread use of electric vehicles, researchers are working on developing advanced battery technologies. One promising approach is the use of nickel-rich layered oxides as cathode materials in lithium-ion batteries (LiBs). These cathodes offer several advantages, such as increased battery capacity, improved rate capabilities, and reduced fabrication costs. However, they also have limitations, including capacity degradation and structural instability during fast-charging and long-term cycling.

To address these limitations, a team of researchers from Argonne National Laboratory and other institutes worldwide has introduced a new strategy. Their work, published in Nature Energy, focuses on the use of epitaxial entropy-assisted oxide coating to improve the structural stability and reliability of ultrahigh-Ni cathodes. This coating suppresses strain propagation, which is the main cause of structural deterioration in cathodes during fast-charging and prolonged cycling.

In their study, the researchers designed a specialized oxide coating that aligns with the structure of Ni-rich cathodes. These coatings not only enhance the robustness of the cathode surface but also improve ionic conductivity, enabling faster charging of batteries. The coating is based on Wadsley-Roth crystallographic shear phases, which have been found to enhance electrode performance in LiBs. These compounds adhere well to Ni-rich cathodes, strengthening their structural stability during operation and fast-charging.

Through a series of experiments, the researchers coated Ni-rich layered cathodes and tested their performance over time and under different conditions. The results were highly promising, as the coating significantly reduced damage to the cathodes, even during fast-charging and after many operation cycles. The researchers believe that this epitaxial entropy-assisted coating strategy opens up new opportunities for surface engineering in the design and development of high-energy and high-power LiBs.

In conclusion, researchers are exploring ways to enhance the performance of LiBs by using nickel-rich layered oxides as cathode materials. The use of epitaxial entropy-assisted oxide coating shows promise in improving the structural stability and reliability of these cathodes. By aligning with the cathode structure and enhancing ionic conductivity, the coating reduces damage during fast-charging and prolongs the lifespan of the batteries. This strategy has the potential to contribute to the development of high-energy and high-power LiBs in the future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/a-strategy-to-suppress.jpg,2024-03-25 09:40:01,Innovation,Innovation

In a regulatory filing on Monday morning, Lucid disclosed that Ayar Third Investment, an affiliate of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, has agreed to purchase $1 billion worth of Lucid's stock. This investment will increase the Kingdom's current ownership stake to approximately 60%.

This fresh injection of funds follows Lucid's recent announcement to investors that it plans to produce approximately 9,000 units of its Air electric vehicles this year, a slight increase from the previous year's output. However, the company faced challenges in finding buyers for its expensive sedan, leading to multiple price reductions in recent months. Additionally, Lucid has plans to commence production of its electric Gravity SUV by the end of this year.

Interestingly, the investment from Saudi Arabia comes shortly after Lucid's CEO, Peter Rawlinson, expressed caution about relying too heavily on the Kingdom for financial support. Rawlinson emphasized his respect for Saudi Arabia's backing but stressed the importance of not assuming unlimited funding from the Public Investment Fund (PIF).

With this significant investment, Lucid Motors aims to address its financial constraints and continue its mission of producing high-quality electric vehicles. The company recognizes the need to diversify its sources of funding and avoid overdependence on any single entity.

As the demand for electric vehicles continues to rise, Lucid Motors faces both challenges and opportunities. The company's ability to streamline production costs and enhance its market appeal will be crucial for its future growth and success. The funding from Saudi Arabia's PIF will provide a much-needed boost, enabling Lucid to navigate these challenges and expand its presence in the electric vehicle market.

In conclusion, Lucid Motors is set to receive a substantial investment of $1 billion from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. This funding will support the company in mitigating the high costs associated with manufacturing and selling its luxury electric sedans. Despite recent struggles in finding buyers for its vehicles, Lucid remains committed to its mission and plans to diversify its offerings with the introduction of the electric Gravity SUV. The investment from Saudi Arabia reflects the Kingdom's continued support for Lucid Motors, while the company acknowledges the importance of not solely relying on a single source of funding. With this new injection of funds, Lucid is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for electric vehicles and drive its future success in the market.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2580.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-25 14:31:52,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.forbes.com/sites/webroot/2024/03/25/7-cyber-safety-tips-to-outsmart-scammers/,7 Cyber Safety Tips To Outsmart Scammers,"Welcome to the exciting world of the internet, where cyber scammers are lurking around every corner. Cybercrime is a real threat that targets people of all ages, from young kids to wise grandparents. And guess what? It's on the rise faster than your Wi-Fi connection during peak hours. So, let's set sail and explore the seven seas of cyber safety.

Before we dive into the tips for staying safe online, let's arm ourselves with the ultimate weapon: knowledge. Scams are like snake oil salespeople in the digital world, peddling miracle cures. They come in various forms, hiding in the dark corners of the internet. To detect scams, remember the golden rule: skepticism.

Now, let's take a quick tour of some common cyber scams:

Phishing scams: Ah, phishing scams, the bane of our digital existence. These sneaky scams involve fake emails that pretend to be from familiar faces or reputable companies. They'll try to trick you into clicking on suspicious links or sharing sensitive information like passwords or credit card details. Remember, real companies don't ask for your personal data via email.

Sweepstakes and awards scams: Congratulations! You've just won a brand new car, a tropical vacation, and a lifetime supply of unicorn-shaped cookies. All you need to do is pay a small processing fee. Sounds too good to be true? That's because it is! These scams promise instant wealth but are clever tricks to empty your wallet faster than you can say ""jackpot.""

Investment scams: Imagine a golden opportunity to double your money with zero risk. Investment scams lure unsuspecting victims with the promise of sky-high profits. Don't let these offers cloud your judgment. Always do thorough research before investing your hard-earned cash.

Lawsuit or tax scams: Lawsuit and tax scams thrive on fear and panic, claiming that you owe urgent payments. When in doubt, verify the legitimacy of any claims before reaching for your wallet.

Romance scams: These scams prey on the hopeful hearts of romantics, spinning elaborate tales of love and devotion before swooping in for the financial kill. Remember, anyone who asks for money online is more likely to break your heart than mend it.

Tech support scams: These imposters offer remote assistance to fix nonexistent problems with your devices while gaining access to your sensitive data. Legitimate tech support doesn't come knocking unsolicited. If in doubt, delete the email and seek help from trusted sources.

Armed with this knowledge, you're ready to navigate the digital minefield with confidence. You can also be a good internet citizen by forwarding these scams to the U.S. government's Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) at phishing-report@us-cert.gov.

Now, let's move on to the seven tips that will help you stay safe online:

1. Use strong passwords: Let's start with the basics. Your password is the key to your digital castle, so make sure it's not something as weak as ""123456"" or ""password."" Get creative! Mix uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters like a mad scientist concocting a secret potion. And remember, don't reuse passwords across multiple accounts unless you want to throw a welcome party for cybercriminals.

2. Enable two-factor authentication: Adding an extra layer of security to your online accounts is like putting a moat around your castle. Two-factor authentication requires you to provide a second form of verification, such as a unique code sent to your phone, in addition to your password. This way, even if someone manages to guess your password, they won't be able to access your account without the second factor.

3. Keep your software up to date: Software updates may not be the most exciting thing in the world, but they are essential for your online safety. Updates often include patches for security vulnerabilities, so make sure you regularly update your operating system, web browsers, and other software to stay one step ahead of cybercriminals.

4. Be cautious with public Wi-Fi: Public Wi-Fi networks can be a breeding ground for hackers. Avoid accessing sensitive information, such as online banking or shopping, when connected to public Wi-Fi. If you must use public Wi-Fi, consider using a virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt your internet connection and protect your data from prying eyes.

5. Think before you click: Clicking on suspicious links or downloading attachments from unknown sources is like opening the door to cybercriminals. Be cautious and think twice before clicking on anything that seems fishy. Hover your mouse over links to see the actual URL before clicking, and if something seems off, trust your instincts and don't proceed.

6. Educate yourself and your loved ones: Knowledge is power when it comes to staying safe online. Take the time to educate yourself about the latest scams and share this knowledge with your family and friends. By raising awareness, you can collectively create a safer online environment for everyone.

7. Use comprehensive cybersecurity software: Last but not least, invest in reliable cybersecurity software to protect your devices from malware, viruses, and other cyber threats. Look for reputable antivirus programs that offer real-time protection, regular scans, and automatic updates to keep your devices safe and secure.

By following these tips, you can navigate the digital world with confidence and reduce the risk of falling victim to cyber scams. Remember, cyber scammers may be lurking in the wild west of the internet, but with knowledge and vigilance, you can protect yourself and enjoy all the wonders the digital world has to offer. Stay safe out there!",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ea0ea426a7cb96ff0f5cde/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 11:48:40,Innovation,Innovation

In today's episode, we have a lot to cover as we reflect on the weekend and look ahead to the week to come.

Let's start with a global financial update. Stocks across the world are experiencing a decline, but on the brighter side, the crypto market is showing some promising gains. It's always interesting to see how these two sectors perform in relation to each other.

Moving on to the startup world, one of the major news stories we need to discuss is the departure of Stability AI's CEO. This is significant because the company's revenue growth and burn rate have been topics of discussion in the past. The CEO's exit could signal important changes for Stability AI's future.

Shifting our focus to Europe, there is an ongoing inquiry into several U.S.-based tech companies due to the implementation of the new Digital Markets Act. It raises the question of whether tech giants can establish a more positive and productive relationship with the European Union.

Speaking of Europe, Spotify has recently made a non-musical move that caught our attention. I have some thoughts on this development and its potential impact on the company's future. Additionally, we have news from China about the country's adoption of the Vision Pro, as well as its efforts to replace Intel and AMD chips in state computers. And finally, we wrap up with a report on how beverage startups are challenging the dominance of industry giants like Coke and Pepsi.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/match-board-directors-after-talks-activist-investor-elliott-management/,Match appoints two board directors after talks with activist investor Elliott Management,"Tinder-owner Match Group has made some significant moves recently, including the appointment of two new members to its board of directors and entering into an agreement with Elliott Management, an activist investor. Laura Jones, the chief marketing officer at Instacart, and Spencer Rascoff, the co-founder of Zillow, will be joining the board immediately.

According to Match, these appointments came after a ""constructive dialogue"" with Elliott Management, and the two companies have entered into an ""information-sharing"" agreement. This development comes a few months after The Wall Street Journal reported that Elliott had acquired a stake of approximately $1 billion in Match Group. The report indicated that Elliott was interested in discussing strategies to improve Match's performance, especially considering the decline in paying users amid economic uncertainty.

Marc Steinberg, a partner at Elliott, expressed confidence in Match Group's potential for value creation as the global leader in online dating. He also praised the collaboration with management and the board, stating that Laura Jones and Spencer Rascoff would bring unique skills and perspectives to support the company's next phase of growth.

Elliott Management is known for acquiring stakes in tech companies and pushing for changes. Their involvement with Match Group follows similar board shakeups at Crown Castle and Etsy. 

In the fourth quarter of 2023, Match Group experienced a 5% decrease in total paid users compared to the previous year, with a total of 15.2 million users. The company's growth has slowed down since the peak it reached during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a 79% decline in its stock since 2021.

Match Group is the parent company of numerous popular dating apps, including Tinder, Hinge, Match.com, Meetic, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, and OurTime, among others.

Overall, these recent developments indicate that Match Group is actively seeking ways to address its challenges and capitalize on its position as a leading player in the online dating industry. The addition of Laura Jones and Spencer Rascoff to the board, along with the collaboration with Elliott Management, suggests a commitment to driving growth and improving performance in the coming months.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1241790742.jpeg?w=1024,2024-03-25 14:15:04,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-i-run-with-these-80-earbuds-instead-of-bone-conduction-headphones/,Why I run with these $80 earbuds instead of bone-conduction headphones,"Introducing the Edifier Comfo Run: The Perfect Workout Companion

If you're someone who enjoys staying active while listening to music, then you know how important it is to find the right headphones. You want something that provides a secure fit, excellent sound quality, and durability. That's where the Edifier Comfo Run wireless sports headphones come in. Priced at just $80, these headphones offer everything you need for a great workout experience.

One of the standout features of the Edifier Comfo Run is its open-ear design. This design allows you to enjoy your favorite tunes while still being aware of your surroundings. Unlike traditional bone conduction headsets, the Comfo Run utilizes traditional speakers directed towards your ears. This means you can enjoy your music without the vibration associated with bone conduction technology.

The headset itself is covered in soft silicone material and features a comfortable neckband that applies minimal pressure to the back of your neck. This ensures that the headset stays securely in place, even during the most intense workouts. I even tested the Comfo Run with sunglasses on, and it remained securely in place. Additionally, it's rated for IP55 dust and splash resistance, so you can exercise outside without worrying about damage.

When it comes to audio performance, the Edifier Comfo Run doesn't disappoint. With 16.2mm dynamic drivers and large speaker grills, these headphones deliver excellent volume and clarity. Even without bone conduction technology, the audio quality is top-notch. And if you're a fan of bass, the Edifier ConneX smartphone app allows you to toggle on more bass for a richer sound experience.

Battery life is another area where the Comfo Run excels. With up to 17 hours of playtime, these headphones outperform most earbuds on the market. And when it's time to recharge, the USB cable and magnetic connector make the process quick and convenient. Just 15 minutes of charging can provide up to five hours of playback.

While the Comfo Run is primarily designed for workouts, it still offers functionality for phone calls. The two built-in microphones and beamforming algorithms ensure clear call quality. Additionally, you can use the microphones to activate your phone or watch voice assistant, making it easy to control your connected device while on the move.

In terms of controls, the Comfo Run features three buttons positioned on the top of the right side, behind your ear. These buttons allow you to adjust volume, power, and manage phone calls and voice assistant commands. With different presses and actions, you can control various functions. While it may take some time to get used to all the functions, the user manual provides detailed instructions.

As someone who has been using bone conduction headphones for workouts, I must say that these new open-ear options are a game-changer. The Edifier Comfo Run offers everything I need in a headset, from long battery life to flawless Bluetooth performance. And at just $80, they're an affordable option for anyone looking to upgrade their workout gear.

If you're tired of losing your earbuds during exercise, want to stay aware of your surroundings, or simply need a reliable pair of headphones for your workouts, then the Edifier Comfo Run is worth considering. With its secure fit, long battery life, and comfortable design, it's a great investment. Don't miss out on this fantastic opportunity to enhance your workout experience.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/dma-first-formal-probes/,"Apple, Google and Meta face first formal investigations under EU's DMA","Collective Noun: A Heap of Investigations: The European Union Cracks Down on Big Tech

The European Union has recently launched a series of investigations on major technology companies, and the collective noun for these inquiries could aptly be described as a ""heap of investigations."" Under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), Alphabet/Google, Apple, and Meta find themselves at the center of the EU's first formal non-compliance investigations since the implementation of the bloc's revamped ex ante competition rules.

Alphabet/Google faces scrutiny over its rules on steering in Google Play and its approach to self-preferencing in search results. The EU is also examining Apple's rules on steering in the App Store and the design of choice screens for alternative web browsers to Safari. Additionally, Meta's ""pay or consent"" model will undergo thorough investigation by the European Commission.

In total, five investigations were announced on Monday, less than three weeks after the compliance deadline for these companies. These three gatekeepers, designated under the pan-EU market power and contestability regulation, are now subject to formal investigation to determine whether they are in violation of the DMA, as the Commission suspects. If found guilty of violating the DMA, fines of up to 10% of global annual turnover can be imposed, with repeat offenses potentially incurring fines of up to 20%.

The European Union has set a maximum timeframe of 12 months to conclude these investigations, with a preliminary report possible within six months. While these guidelines exist, senior Commission officials have acknowledged that the probes may be concluded sooner or potentially take longer.

This enforcement action by the EU coincides with increased antitrust scrutiny on these three U.S. companies within their home country as well. Since the announcement of their DMA compliance plans, there has been a range of criticism suggesting that these proposals do not align with the new EU law.

Google has faced accusations of attempting to circumvent the regulation's ban on self-preferencing by introducing new rich features in search results that unfairly compete with rivals. Apple's use of notifications to warn users about the risks of leaving its controlled environment has been condemned by developers as ""scare screens,"" among other criticisms. Meta's ""pay or be tracked"" tactic has also drawn widespread condemnation from privacy and consumer rights groups. Furthermore, earlier this month, the Commission raised questions about this tactic under the DMA's sister regulation, the Digital Services Act.

""The Commission has opened proceedings to assess whether the measures implemented by Alphabet and Apple in relation to their obligations pertaining to app stores are in breach of the DMA. Article 5(4) of the DMA requires gatekeepers to allow app developers to 'steer' consumers to offers outside the gatekeepers' app stores, free of charge,"" the Commission stated. It expressed concerns that the steering measures implemented by Alphabet and Apple ""may not be fully compliant"" due to various restrictions and limitations, such as constraints on developers' ability to freely communicate, promote offers, and directly conclude contracts.

Regarding Google's self-preferencing, the EU investigation will focus on Google's vertical search services, including Google Shopping, Google Flights, and Google Hotels, and the impact these actions may have on similar rival services. The Commission is concerned that Alphabet's compliance measures may not ensure fair and non-discriminatory treatment of third-party services featured on Google's search results page, as required by Article 6(5) of the DMA.

The EU will also examine Apple's compliance with user choice obligations on iOS, such as enabling easy app uninstallation, allowing users to change default settings, and presenting choice screens that effectively and easily allow users to select alternative default services, such as web browsers and search engines on their iPhones. The Commission expressed concerns that Apple's measures, including the design of the web browser choice screen, may prevent users from truly exercising their choice of services within the Apple ecosystem, in violation of Article 6(3) of the DMA.

As for Meta, the EU's proceedings will investigate whether its recently introduced ""pay or consent"" model for EU users complies with Article 5(2) of the DMA. This portion of the regulation requires gatekeepers to obtain user consent when combining or cross-using personal data across different core platform services. The Commission is concerned that Meta's binary choice model may not provide a genuine alternative if users refuse to consent, thereby failing to achieve the objective of preventing the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers.

During a press conference, the EU's internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, emphasized that the DMA imposes a clear requirement on gatekeepers to offer free, non-preferential access to alternative services. The investigations currently underway will determine whether these major tech companies are upholding their obligations under the DMA and whether they are engaging in anti-competitive practices.

As the EU proceeds with these investigations and aims to safeguard fair competition and consumer choice, the outcomes will undoubtedly shape the future of the digital landscape and the operations of Big Tech within the European market.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1031626648.jpg?resize=1200,799",2024-03-25 12:10:10,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/gostudent-tutoring-profitability/,"GoStudent, the online learning platform, says it's now profitable","GoStudent, an online tutoring marketplace based in Vienna, Austria, has become one of the most successful startups in the country, with a valuation of $3.2 billion. The platform boasts 11 million families and 23,000 tutors. In addition to its impressive growth, GoStudent has achieved profitability, which sets it apart from many other technology companies. CEO Felix Ohswald stated that the company is not only EBITDA positive, but also has positive operating cash flow. This is a significant milestone for the company, especially considering the challenges it faced during the recent market crash for online learning.

GoStudent's journey to profitability has not been without obstacles. Like many other companies, it experienced a decline in customer demand and faced cash burn issues. The company lost €89 million in 2021 and €220 million in 2022. As a result, GoStudent had to undergo several rounds of layoffs and implement major cost-cutting measures. However, it managed to turn things around by reducing its burn rate by 70% in 2023. Despite the difficulties, GoStudent's growth has been remarkable, with revenue exceeding €100 million within just two years.

The COVID-19 pandemic played a significant role in GoStudent's success. The digital transformation brought about by the pandemic led to increased demand for online education, benefiting edtech companies like GoStudent. The company quickly became a trusted solution for students in need of educational support. However, despite its popularity, GoStudent still needed to address its cash burn issue. It made several strategic changes, including cutting expenses on parties and acquisitions, as well as refocusing its market expansion efforts.

GoStudent decided to exit the US market and instead focus on expanding in Europe. It also adopted a more organic growth strategy, prioritizing bottom-line growth over top-line growth. The company aims to become the leading global tutoring platform, but it understands the importance of balancing growth with cost-effectiveness. GoStudent's acquisition of Studienkreis, a physical learning center with 1,000 locations in Germany, demonstrates its commitment to hybrid learning. The company believes that the future of education lies in a hybrid approach, combining online tutoring with physical learning centers.

Most of GoStudent's tutors are university students, which allows them to connect better with students while providing personalized tutoring. The company leverages technology to match students with the right tutors, regardless of location. This approach ensures that each student receives the support they need to succeed academically.

In conclusion, GoStudent has become a major player in the online tutoring market, with a valuation of $3.2 billion and a profitable business model. Despite facing challenges during the market crash, the company managed to navigate through the difficulties and achieve profitability. By focusing on bottom-line growth and expanding its hybrid learning model, GoStudent is well-positioned to continue its success in the education technology sector.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Founders-of-GoStudent-Gregor-Muller-I-Felix-Ohswald-2.jpg?w=1024,2024-03-25 11:00:36,Innovation,Innovation
