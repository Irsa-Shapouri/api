https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-vulnerability-virtual-reality.html,Vulnerability in virtual reality systems identified,"Virtual reality (VR) systems have revolutionized the way we interact with digital environments. They offer users the ability to immerse themselves in a virtual world where anything is possible. However, a team of computer scientists from the University of Chicago has recently discovered a potential vulnerability in VR systems that could have serious implications for user security.

In their research, the team envisioned a scenario where hackers could manipulate a user's VR experience by inserting an ""inception layer"" between their VR Home Screen and their VR User/Server. This layer would create a simulated VR app that deceives users into revealing sensitive information to the hackers.

The concept behind this app is similar to the movie ""Inception,"" where characters have altered layers of reality downloaded into their brains. In the case of VR systems, the inception layer would create an altered reality that appears to be the user's normal VR environment. However, this layer would allow hackers to record information, intercept and alter data, and even add deceptive imagery to the VR world.

Imagine a scenario where a user enters their passcode into a virtual ATM within the VR world. The inception layer could record this passcode and send it to the hacker without the user's knowledge. Similarly, if a user designates a certain amount of cash for a virtual purchase, the inception layer could intercept the transaction and reroute the funds to the hacker's bank account.

Furthermore, the inception layer could manipulate the VR environment by adding characters that represent the user's friends or family. This could be used as a means to gain trust or access to personal secrets. Additionally, the app could monitor and alter the user's gestures, voice, browsing activity, and social or business interactions within the VR world.

To test the feasibility of this vulnerability, the research team enlisted the help of 28 volunteers who played a game using a demonstration VR headset. They downloaded the app onto the devices, simulating a hacking scenario, and asked the volunteers if they noticed anything unusual. While the download process caused a slight flickering, only 10 of the volunteers noticed it, and only one of them questioned whether something malicious was happening.

The researchers promptly notified Meta, the company behind the Meta Quest VR system used in the experiment, about their findings. Meta has expressed its intention to investigate the potential vulnerability and take appropriate measures to address it. The research team also emphasizes that similar vulnerabilities may exist in other VR systems and apps that attempt to insert themselves between users and their VR devices.

This discovery highlights the importance of ensuring the security of VR systems. As VR technology becomes increasingly integrated into our daily lives, it is crucial to address potential vulnerabilities and protect users from malicious attacks. By understanding the risks associated with VR and taking proactive measures to mitigate them, we can continue to enjoy the benefits of this innovative technology while safeguarding our personal information and privacy.

In conclusion, the potential vulnerability identified by the University of Chicago research team serves as a wake-up call for the VR industry. It is imperative that VR system developers and manufacturers prioritize security and diligently address any vulnerabilities that may compromise user safety. By doing so, we can ensure that the virtual worlds we explore remain safe and enjoyable experiences for all.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/vulnerability-in-virtu.jpg,2024-03-25 10:20:02,Innovation,Innovation

The company, founded 10 years ago and valued at $500 million in 2021, is backed by notable investors such as Goldman Sachs, Visa, Mastercard, and Accel. However, Deserve has been in talks with investment bankers about selling itself, as it grapples with the impact of the crypto industry's turmoil.

Deserve has raised $150 million in equity funding since its inception in 2013 but has yet to achieve profitability. According to insiders, the company burned through approximately $15 million to $20 million in 2023. Deserve's founder and CEO, Kalpesh Kapadia, remains optimistic about the company's future, expecting strong growth in the coming year. Despite the challenges, he believes that Deserve's partnerships, investments, and mergers and acquisitions discussions will position the company for success.

Industry experts predict that if Deserve were to be sold, it would likely fetch less than its peak valuation in 2021. This is due to the general decline in fintech valuations and Deserve's unique setback. In 2021, the company aimed to collaborate with crypto lenders to issue credit cards. Unfortunately, its largest customer, crypto lender BlockFi, went bankrupt, impacting Deserve's business.

Kalpesh Kapadia, originally from India, came to the United States in the mid-1990s for further studies. With a master's degree in industrial engineering and an MBA, he worked in finance for 15 years before founding Deserve. Initially, the company focused on providing consumer credit cards to underserved populations such as immigrants and students. However, breaking into the consumer lending market proved challenging and capital-intensive. In 2018, Deserve pivoted its business model after Sallie Mae, a student loan bank, approached them with an interest in launching their own credit card. Deserve saw this as an opportunity to help other companies launch credit cards, and Sallie Mae became their first customer.

Deserve's role in the credit card launch process is comprehensive, handling tasks such as assessing borrower risk, processing transactions, and managing customer service. While the company shifted its focus, it continued to operate its original consumer card business, collecting fees and interest income but refraining from acquiring new customers.

In March 2021, Kapadia mentioned that Deserve had more business than it could handle, with numerous bitcoin companies interested in credit cards. Deserve subsequently collaborated with BlockFi to launch a rewards card, becoming their largest customer. However, BlockFi's subsequent collapse and bankruptcy in November 2022 severely impacted Deserve's revenue.

Aside from the challenges posed by the crypto industry's instability, Deserve faced another hurdle as interest rates rose and the startup funding market became stagnant. Several fintech customers, including GloriFi, struggled to survive, affecting Deserve's business. Despite these obstacles, Deserve currently has 15 customers, half of which are fintech companies like M1, while the other half are banks.

Competition in the tech-enabled credit card issuing space has intensified over the past year. Marqeta, a publicly traded payments company, announced its acquisition of Power Finance, an early-stage credit card issuer, in January 2023. This indicates the growing competition that Deserve must navigate.

In conclusion, Deserve, a startup specializing in assisting companies with credit card launches, is facing challenges due to a slowdown in business and a challenging funding market. Despite these obstacles, Deserve remains optimistic about its future and continues to explore strategic discussions surrounding partnerships, investments, and mergers and acquisitions. The company's founder, Kalpesh Kapadia, believes that Deserve's strong growth potential and its solid customer base will position it for success. However, it is essential for Deserve to navigate the impact of the crypto industry's turmoil and the increasing competition in the credit card issuing space.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600d053afe6bed0f9b925c9/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 11:57:06,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/talpatalon/2024/03/25/former-director-of-mossad-cohen-talks-trust-and-softbanks-investments/,Former Director Of Mossad Cohen Talks Trust And SoftBank’s Investments,"Title: The Art of Building Trust: Insights from Former Mossad Chief Yossi Cohen

Introduction:
In the world of espionage, trust is not just a concept but a critical tool for survival. Former head of Israel's Intelligence Agency, Yossi Cohen, shares his insights on the art of building trust and knowing when to break it. As an ordinary person, trust may be seen as a genuine and unbreakable connection, but for Cohen, it is a technique that can be mastered. In this article, we delve into Cohen's perspective on trust and its significance in his current role as the head of SoftBank Investment Advisers' activities in Israel.

Building Trust: A Skill to Master:
Cohen emphasizes that trust is not something you can act out; it must be genuine and reliable. To illustrate this point, he offers an example of how he would establish trust with someone even before meeting them. By leveraging information and orchestrating chance encounters, Cohen aims to create an initial connection that goes beyond mere technique. His personality and judgment are what truly make the difference.

Cohen's Role at SoftBank Investment Advisers:
Having joined SoftBank in 2021, Cohen aims to bridge the gap between the ""start-up nation"" of Israel and the tech-oriented investment group. His extensive regional connections are expected to support SoftBank's presence in the Middle East. Since his arrival, the company has made significant investments in IoT security company Claroty and SASE cybersecurity company Cato Networks. Cohen reveals that they are currently finalizing another substantial investment in Israel, with AI infrastructure and its application in various sectors as promising avenues.

Israel's Resilient Economy and AI Focus:
Cohen acknowledges that Israel's economy has proven to be highly stable, even in times of crises and economic downturns. Moody's recent credit rating cut and a reported decline in Angel investments have not shaken his confidence in Israel's economic landscape. The country's diverse makeup, opinionated nature, and survivor-mentality have contributed to its thriving start-up ecosystem, particularly in emerging technologies such as AI, cybersecurity, and HealthTech.

SoftBank's AI-Driven Vision:
SoftBank's return to profitability after five quarters can be attributed, in part, to its investments in AI-supporting technologies like chip design company Arm. Masayoshi Son, the visionary behind SoftBank, has shown a keen interest in investing in AI-based systems. One recent highlight includes an investment in nuclear fusion startup Blue Laser Fusion, led by Japanese Nobel prize winner Shuji Nakamura. This investment aligns with the growing power demands of AI-based technologies and aims to provide clean energy solutions.

SoftBank's Conviction in Israel's Tech Innovation:
Brett Rochkind, Managing Partner for SoftBank Investment Advisers, praises the resilience and technical skills of the Israeli market and SoftBank's portfolio. Israel's entrepreneurial spirit, coupled with its world-class research institutions and the IDF's training, positions it at the forefront of technology innovation. SoftBank remains committed to investing in generationally defining companies that emerge from Israel's thriving ecosystem.

Conclusion:
Trust is not just a fleeting façade but a powerful tool in the world of espionage. Yossi Cohen's expertise in building trust has made him a valuable asset to SoftBank Investment Advisers. Israel's stable economy, thriving start-up ecosystem, and focus on AI technologies have caught the attention of SoftBank and its visionary leader, Masayoshi Son. As SoftBank continues to invest in Israel's tech innovation, the partnership between Cohen and SoftBank promises to open doors to new opportunities and groundbreaking advancements in the world of technology.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6601629a82438fed58969753/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 11:36:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-large-language-simple-mechanism-knowledge.html,Large language models use a surprisingly simple mechanism to retrieve some stored knowledge,"Large language models (LLMs) are complex tools that are used in various fields such as customer support, code generation, and language translation. Despite their widespread use, scientists still have limited understanding of how these models actually work. To gain insight into their inner workings, researchers from MIT and other institutions conducted a study on how these models retrieve and decode stored knowledge.

The study revealed an interesting finding: LLMs often use a simple linear function to recover and decode information. Linear functions are basic equations with two variables and no exponents, representing a straightforward relationship between the variables. What's more, the models use the same decoding function for similar types of facts. By identifying these linear functions for different facts, the researchers were able to examine the model's knowledge on new subjects and determine where that knowledge is stored within the model.

Using a technique they developed, the researchers found that even when a model provides an incorrect answer, it often has the correct information stored. This approach could be used in the future to identify and correct falsehoods within the model, reducing the occurrence of incorrect or nonsensical answers.

Evan Hernandez, an electrical engineering and computer science graduate student at MIT and co-lead author of the study, explains that despite the complexity of these models, there are sometimes simple mechanisms at work inside them. This discovery sheds light on the inner workings of LLMs and provides a potential avenue for improving their accuracy.

The study was conducted by Hernandez, Arnab Sharma (a computer science graduate student at Northeastern University), Jacob Andreas (an associate professor in EECS at MIT), David Bau (an assistant professor of computer science at Northeastern), and other researchers from MIT, Harvard University, and the Israeli Institute of Technology. The findings will be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations in May.

LLMs, also known as transformer models, are neural networks that consist of interconnected nodes or neurons. These networks encode and process data, and much of the knowledge stored in a transformer model can be represented as relations connecting subjects and objects. For example, the relation ""Miles Davis plays the trumpet"" connects the subject (Miles Davis) to the object (trumpet).

As a transformer model acquires more knowledge, it stores additional facts about a particular subject across multiple layers. When a user poses a query about that subject, the model must decode the most relevant fact to formulate a response. The researchers aimed to understand the mechanism by which the model retrieves and uses this information.

Through a series of experiments, the researchers discovered that despite their complexity, LLMs decode relational information using a simple linear function. Each decoding function is specific to the type of fact being retrieved. For example, one function is used to output the instrument a person plays, while another function is used to output the state where a person was born.

To estimate these linear functions, the researchers developed a method and computed functions for 47 different relations, such as ""capital city of a country"" and ""lead singer of a band."" While there are countless possible relations, the researchers focused on this subset because they represent the types of facts that can be expressed in this manner.

Each function was tested by altering the subject to determine if it could successfully retrieve the correct object information. The findings demonstrate that LLMs have a systematic way of decoding information using linear functions, providing valuable insights into their functioning.

This study contributes to our understanding of large language models and their underlying mechanisms. By uncovering the use of linear functions in retrieving and decoding knowledge, researchers can not only gain insights into the models' functioning but also potentially improve their accuracy by correcting false information. Further research and exploration in this area could lead to advancements in the field of natural language processing and artificial intelligence as a whole.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/large-language-models-2.jpg,2024-03-25 09:34:06,Innovation,Innovation

Software is going through a transformation, known as digital transformation, where cloud-native infrastructures are increasingly being used to power always-on applications for both enterprise and consumer use, including gaming.

The challenge with software modernization is that it always wants to be up-to-date. What was considered modern last year may not be modern this year, and what is modern today may be outdated next year. Although things don't usually change that fast, the rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) last year was indeed meteoric.

To identify the next major tech trends, the IT industry conducts reports, surveys, and analysis initiatives to provide quantifiers, qualifiers, and identifiers that help us understand IT change. Red Hat's recent 'State of Application Modernization Report,' in collaboration with research firm Illuminas, highlights new movements. While enterprise application containers were considered the trend last year, this analysis suggests that Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines have taken the lead in defining software modernization. However, next year, containers may regain their popularity along with generative AI.

Nutanix, a multi-cloud platform company, is also keen on staying ahead of the software modernization agenda. Their sixth global Enterprise Cloud Index (ECI) survey and research report, which measures enterprise cloud adoption, reveals an increasing adoption of hybrid multi-cloud models. These models combine private on-premises clouds with public cloud services from different Cloud Services Providers (CSPs) and are expected to double in the next one to three years.

Hybrid multi-cloud refers to a combination of private on-premises clouds, public cloud services, and services that span both worlds. It also includes multi-cloud, where services come from multiple CSPs, based on factors like price, data governance, and technical considerations. Additionally, there's poly-cloud, where a monolithic application distributes its workloads across different clouds. Regardless of the specific definition used, these cloud formats represent software modernization, driven by factors such as AI, security, and sustainability.

As organizations navigate the complexities of moving applications and data across environments, the Nutanix report emphasizes the use of hybrid multi-cloud infrastructure. It highlights security and innovation as the top drivers for moving applications between environments in the past year. With AI becoming increasingly important for businesses, respondents identified investing in AI strategy as their top priority, followed closely by IT modernization.

Lee Caswell, Senior VP for Product & Solutions Marketing at Nutanix, emphasizes the growing pressure on IT organizations to modernize their infrastructure quickly due to factors like AI, sustainability, and security. According to the report, 80% of survey respondents plan to invest in IT modernization, with 85% planning to increase their investments in this area.

In conclusion, the software industry is constantly evolving, and organizations are under pressure to keep up with the latest trends and technologies. Hybrid multi-cloud models and AI are at the forefront of software modernization efforts, driven by the need for security, innovation, and IT modernization. As we look to the future, containers and generative AI are expected to play significant roles in shaping the software landscape.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660181597188fb59284d9023/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 10:28:24,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/dma-first-formal-probes/,"Apple, Google and Meta face first formal investigations under EU's DMA","The European Union has announced a series of investigations on Big Tech companies, including Alphabet/Google, Apple, and Meta. These probes are being conducted under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which aims to promote fair competition in the digital market. The investigations will focus on various aspects of the companies' operations, such as Google's rules on steering in Google Play and self-preferencing in search results, Apple's rules on steering in the App Store, and Meta's ""pay or consent"" model. 

Five investigations were announced on Monday, less than three weeks after the compliance deadline for the companies. The three gatekeepers, designated under the pan-EU market power and contestability regulation, are facing formal investigations to determine whether they are breaching the DMA. Violations of the DMA can result in fines of up to 10% of global annual turnover, or even 20% for repeat offenses. The EU will have up to 12 months to conclude the investigations, although the probes may conclude sooner or take longer than these guidelines.

This enforcement action by the EU comes as antitrust scrutiny on these three US firms continues to increase in their home country as well. Criticism has been raised against Google, accusing the company of trying to avoid the regulation's ban on self-preferencing. Apple has faced criticism for its use of notifications to warn users of risks outside its ecosystem, while Meta's ""pay or be tracked"" tactic has been condemned by privacy and consumer rights groups.

The European Commission is concerned about various aspects of the companies' compliance with the DMA. In the case of Alphabet/Google, the investigation will focus on its vertical search services and the impact its actions may have on rival services. The Commission is concerned that Alphabet's measures may not ensure fair treatment of third-party services on Google's search results page. 

For Apple, the EU will examine whether the company is complying with user choice obligations on iOS, including uninstalling apps, changing default settings, and prompt users with choice screens. The Commission is concerned that Apple's measures, including the design of the web browser choice screen, may prevent users from exercising their choice of services within the Apple ecosystem.

Regarding Meta, the EU will investigate its ""pay or consent"" model for EU users. The Commission is concerned that this model may not provide a real alternative for users who do not consent, thereby not achieving the objective of preventing the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers.

These investigations are part of the EU's efforts to ensure fair competition in the digital market and protect consumers' interests. The DMA aims to create a level playing field for all market players and prevent the abuse of market power by gatekeepers. The investigations will shed light on whether these Big Tech companies are complying with the regulations and taking the necessary steps to promote fair competition and protect user rights.

In conclusion, the EU's announcement of investigations on Big Tech companies under the DMA highlights the ongoing efforts to regulate the digital market and promote fair competition. These investigations will examine various aspects of the companies' operations and determine whether they are complying with the regulations. It remains to be seen how these investigations will unfold and what impact they will have on the digital market.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1031626648.jpg?resize=1200,799",2024-03-25 12:10:10,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/gostudent-tutoring-profitability/,"GoStudent, the online learning platform, says it's now profitable","GoStudent, a prominent online tutoring marketplace based in Vienna, Austria, has achieved profitability, marking a significant milestone for the company. Founded in 2016 by Felix Ohswald and Gregor Müller, GoStudent boasts a user base of 11 million families and 23,000 tutors. It is one of the few Austrian startups to have gained international recognition, alongside Bitpanda and Runtastic.

Despite its recent success, GoStudent faced challenges along the way. The online learning market experienced a crash, resulting in a decline in customer demand. In 2021, GoStudent incurred a loss of €89 million, which escalated to €220 million in 2022. This led to layoffs and cost-cutting measures. However, the company managed to turn things around by implementing strategic changes.

Ohswald described the period of rapid expansion as ""crazy"" hyperscaling. Within a span of just two years, GoStudent grew its revenue from zero to over €100 million. However, this growth came at a cost, with a cash burn of over €150 million in 2022 alone. As the market conditions changed, GoStudent realized it needed to reevaluate its approach.

In 2023, the company reduced its burn rate by 70%, but it was still insufficient. GoStudent made tough decisions, including layoffs and a shift in focus. It recognized the need to scale more carefully and prioritize key areas for growth. The company's success can be attributed to the surge in demand for online education during the COVID-19 pandemic.

To achieve profitability, GoStudent made several adjustments. It cut down on extravagant expenses, paused acquisitions, and refrained from entering new markets where online tutoring was not well-established. It also exited the highly competitive U.S. market and shifted its focus to Europe. GoStudent now aims to adopt a more organic growth strategy, with a renewed emphasis on bottom-line growth.

While GoStudent's primary focus has been on tutoring, its acquisition of StudienKreis in 2022 indicates a shift toward a more comprehensive approach to education. StudienKreis, founded in 1974, operates physical learning centers in Germany. GoStudent plans to leverage these centers to offer hybrid learning, combining online and offline resources.

Ohswald believes that the future of education lies in hybrid models, and GoStudent aims to become a global leader in personalized tutoring. The company's platform matches students with suitable tutors, regardless of their location. Most of GoStudent's tutors are university students, making it easier for them to connect with pupils while providing quality education.

Moving forward, GoStudent faces the challenge of balancing growth and cost optimization. It strives to fulfill its mission of unlocking the potential of every student through personalized tutoring while keeping expenses in check. By leveraging technology and a hybrid learning approach, GoStudent aims to revolutionize the education sector and make quality tutoring accessible to students worldwide.

In conclusion, GoStudent's journey to profitability showcases the company's resilience and adaptability. Despite initial setbacks, it has emerged as a key player in the online tutoring market. With a renewed focus on Europe and a commitment to personalized education, GoStudent is poised for further growth and success in the years to come.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Founders-of-GoStudent-Gregor-Muller-I-Felix-Ohswald-2.jpg?w=1024,2024-03-25 11:00:36,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/daphneewingchow/2024/03/25/game-changing-campaign-could-improve-food-security-for-africa/,‘Game Changing’ Campaign Could Improve Food Security For Africa,"As the world grapples with the complexities of food security in an ever-changing climate, the focus has shifted from calories alone to nutrition and food pathways. This shift in perspective is particularly relevant to Africa, a continent with immense potential for a resilient and nourishing food future.

Traditionally, the global development sector has focused on ensuring that people have enough food. However, Dr. Cary Fowler, U.S. Special Envoy for Global Food Security, emphasizes that the challenge goes beyond filling people's bellies. It's about providing good nutrition and building a food system that is based on nutrition. This requires understanding the kind of agricultural system needed to accomplish that goal.

In line with this approach, the Vision for Adapted Crops and Soils (VACS) campaign, led by the United States Department of State (USDoS), the African Union (AU), and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), has uncovered the hidden treasures of Africa's agricultural landscape. Through two reports, VACS aims to identify and promote climate-resilient crops that meet various criteria, including cultural relevance, climate resilience, and nutrition. This initiative has the potential to revolutionize food systems from their core.

According to Dr. Fowler, this is the first time anyone has undertaken such an endeavor. VACS has analyzed essential crops for their nutritional value and their ability to withstand climate change. This comprehensive approach, combined with a collaborative and culturally sensitive focus, sets VACS apart from traditional food security campaigns.

VACS deviates from the usual intervention strategies that prioritize calorie-dense staples like maize, potatoes, and rice. Instead, it embraces an ""indicative list"" of indigenous crops that have the potential for productivity, nutrition, and cultural significance. This shortlist includes crops such as fonio, pearl millet, pigeon peas, taro, yams, and lablab.

The selection of these ""opportunity crops"" was a result of a multidisciplinary approach involving plant breeders, nutritionists, and climate scientists. Each crop was profiled based on six broad criteria and 24 more specific criteria related to climate resilience, nutritional value, cultural significance, geographic applicability, business potential, and environmental benefits.

In the face of challenges like climate variability and infrastructural barriers, VACS offers hope and direction. It showcases the power of collective action and shared purpose in shaping a nourished, resilient, and prosperous future for Africa and beyond. As Dr. Fowler puts it, ""It is an all-hands-on-deck moment."" The time for transformation is now, and VACS is leading the charge towards a brighter tomorrow—one seed, one harvest, one meal at a time, starting with the African continent.

Africa bears the heaviest burden when it comes to global food insecurity and climate crises. Relentless floods and prolonged droughts devastate farmlands, leaving millions across sub-Saharan Africa without vital nourishment. Women and children are among the most vulnerable, with over 80% of people in Sub-Saharan Africa suffering from iron deficiency.

The VACS initiative recognizes the urgency of addressing these challenges. By focusing on climate-resilient crops that are culturally relevant and nutritionally rich, VACS aims to provide sustainable solutions for food security. This initiative brings together stakeholders from different sectors to work towards a more resilient and nourished future for Africa and its people.

In conclusion, VACS represents a transformative approach to food security in Africa. By prioritizing nutrition, climate resilience, and cultural relevance, VACS has the potential to revolutionize food systems and pave the way for a brighter future. With collective action and shared purpose, we can build a more nourished, resilient, and prosperous Africa—one crop, one harvest, one meal at a time. The time for transformation is now, and VACS is leading the way.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66019249d6958363c6c73ff4/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3000,1688,x0,y110,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 11:03:56,Innovation,Innovation

The Thiel Fellowship, established by billionaire Peter Thiel in 2011, offers $100,000 to individuals who choose to forgo college and start their own companies.

Meneses, a 23-year-old from Sergipe, a northeastern state in Brazil, made the bold decision to leave his undergraduate studies at Stanford University. Now, he has been selected to participate in the two-year acceleration program. He expressed his gratitude for this exceptional opportunity.

In 2022, Meneses teamed up with Felipe Lamounier, Daniel Silva, and Rohan Ramanath to co-found Hyperplane, a data intelligence firm that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to assist banks in utilizing their data for enhancing customer experiences through hyper-personalization. Although Hyperplane is headquartered in Silicon Valley, it originated in Brazil and has secured contracts with 12 of the country's major financial institutions.

Hyperplane has garnered significant investments, amounting to 30 million reais ($6 million), from esteemed backers such as Lachy Groom, SV Angel, Clocktower Technology Ventures, Liquid2 Ventures, Soma Capital, Latitud, Atman Capital, Crestone VC, and Norte. Additionally, the company has been chosen to participate in Endeavor's Scale-UP acceleration program in the first half of 2024.

Meneses stands out as the sole Latin American founder to be included in this year's Thiel Fellowship. Notably, in 2023, there were no entrepreneurs from the region on the list either.

However, Latin names were featured in the 2022 roster of Thiel Fellows. Among them was Ian Lee, the founder of Examedi, a healthtech company based in Chile. Examedi enables patients to access healthcare services by connecting them with available healthcare providers. Another Latin entrepreneur from the 2022 cohort is Tamara Chaya Romo, a Mexican leading MEDU, a company focused on developing reusable personal protective equipment.
