https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikestubbs/2024/03/24/new-valorant-agent-clove-can-come-back-from-the-dead/,New ‘Valorant’ Agent Clove Can Come Back From The Dead,"Clove, the latest agent in Riot Games' Valorant, brings a unique set of abilities to the game. Unveiled at the Valorant Masters Madrid tournament, Clove's abilities have sparked excitement among players. As the 25th agent, Clove is a controller, specializing in disrupting enemies and providing utility for their team. However, what sets Clove apart is their ability to come back from the dead, making them a valuable and lethal asset on the battlefield. Set to launch in the upcoming Valorant patch on March 26, Clove is sure to shake up the game.

Let's take a closer look at Clove's abilities. First up is their E ability, Ruse. This ability allows Clove to create a smoke screen, similar to Brimstone's smoke. By pressing E, a small window appears, providing a top-down view of the area you're in. From there, you can choose where to drop the smoke, obstructing vision like any other smoke ability. What makes Ruse even more intriguing is that it can be used even when Clove is dead, amplifying their usefulness beyond expectations.

Next, we have Clove's Q ability, Meddle. This ability is a throwable grenade that inflicts decay on enemies hit by it. While it may seem less impactful compared to other abilities, Meddle can still be a game-changer when utilized effectively.

Moving on to Clove's C ability, Pick-Me-Up. This ability is somewhat reminiscent of Reyna's kit, allowing Clove to absorb the life essence of enemies they've killed. By doing so, they gain haste and a temporary health buff. Although not the most unique ability, Pick-Me-Up adds another layer of versatility to Clove's playstyle.

Now, let's delve into Clove's ultimate ability, the highlight of their kit. When Clove dies with their ultimate ready, they have the ability to quickly cast it and come back to life for a short period. If they manage to secure a kill or assist during this resurrection period, they are fully revived as if they never died. However, if they fail to do so, they return to the grave once the resurrection timer runs out. This ultimate ability introduces an exciting dynamic to the game, rewarding players for their skill and providing a chance to turn the tide of battle.

Clove's abilities not only make them a force to be reckoned with when alive but also a valuable asset when taken down. Their ability to come back to life and gain extra health through their C ability, along with the smokes that can be deployed post-death, make them an exceptional entry fragger. With the reduced risk of dying, Clove can make daring plays and contribute significantly to the team's success.

Dan Hardison, agent gameplay designer on Valorant, explains the optimal gameplay strategy for Clove. ""Optimal Clove gameplay is about playing with fire,"" he says. ""You need to take risks and trade your own life for the greater good to remove enemy utility from the round by killing opponents to have success."" Hardison emphasizes that Clove differs from other controllers, as their raw execute utility may be weaker on average. However, their ability to contribute even after death means that players should always fight to the death instead of cowering from opponents. In fact, Hardison suggests that sometimes it's correct for Clove to rush in and die, as long as they're traded by an ally. This trade-off can be advantageous, especially if Clove's life is exchanged for that of a non-Clove opponent. To truly master Clove, players must be willing to make sacrifices for the sake of the team.

Clove's arrival in Valorant is highly anticipated, and their abilities certainly live up to the hype. With the ability to disrupt enemies, provide utility, and come back from the dead, Clove brings a fresh and exciting dynamic to the game. Whether you're an entry fragger looking to make daring plays or a team player willing to sacrifice for the greater good, Clove is sure to leave a lasting impact on the battlefield. Get ready to experience Valorant like never before with the addition of this remarkable agent, set to launch on March 26.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff3fefa4d4cfc35a9fc1fe/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 11:15:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/technology/article/what-are-rpg-games/,What Is A Role-Playing Game? RPG Types Explained,"Role-playing games (RPGs) have different meanings for different people. Some view RPGs as tabletop games where friends gather around and create stories through rolling dice. Others see RPGs as games with character customization, interactive storylines, and discussions about gameplay with friends. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or a newcomer to RPGs, this guide will help you explore the most common types of role-playing games and find the right one for you.

What Are Role-Playing Games?
Role-playing games allow players to embody a character within a game that also functions as a story. The decisions made by players affect their characters and the direction of the story. The story can be controlled by a computer or by another player.

The most prevalent structure of an RPG involves players assuming the role of a single character. They have the freedom to determine the character's appearance, behavior, and actions within the story. These characters remain part of the story until they die, are removed by a game element, or when the player wishes to switch to a different character.

In this traditional setup, one player acts as the Game Master, overseeing the game's progression. This person reacts to player actions, portrays supporting or antagonist characters, and resolves any rule disputes. Game Mastering can be a challenging but rewarding role for those who want to be at the heart of every game session.

Some RPGs offer a more collaborative structure where everyone has equal control over the narrative. The game's rules determine who controls the story at any given time. These games often aim to emulate specific styles of fiction or the atmosphere of other media, like film or television.

Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is widely regarded as the earliest role-playing game. While other games may have existed prior to it, D&D captured the attention of a broad audience. It was first published in 1974 and has since inspired countless other games, including many video games. RPGs on home computers and game consoles emerged in the 1980s and have grown increasingly complex over the years.

Even today, Dungeons & Dragons remains the most popular tabletop RPG on the market. It has also made a significant impact in the world of computer games, particularly with the release of Baldur's Gate 3. However, there are numerous other RPGs to explore, each with its own unique strengths that cater to various fan bases.

Types Of RPG Games
RPGs come in various forms, often blurring the lines between different features and focuses. Here are some of the most common styles of RPGs, along with examples:

1. MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game)
MMORPGs are played online by thousands, or even millions, of people. Players log in to a central server, create and improve their characters, and embark on missions. Some servers prioritize missions and character performance, while others emphasize role-playing and staying in character.

World of Warcraft remains the most popular MMORPG, with other notable examples including Guild Wars 2, EVE Online, Star Wars: The Old Republic, and Black Desert Online.

2. ARPG (Action Role-Playing Game)
Action role-playing games revolve around combat as a primary gameplay component. Players must learn how to fight and equip their characters effectively. While these games often focus on single-player battles, some also offer multiplayer options.

The Diablo series is an excellent example of this type of RPG. Other notable ARPGs include Elder Ring, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Borderlands.

3. CRPG (Computer or Console Role-Playing Game)
CRPGs encompass RPGs played on computers or video game consoles. These games typically offer a single-player, pre-scripted experience, guiding players through a specific storyline while allowing for some exploration within dungeons or enclosed areas.

Bioware games like Mass Effect and Dragon Age exemplify this genre, as do titles such as Planescape: Torment, Disco Elysium, and Shadowrun Returns.

4. JRPG (Japanese Role-Playing Game)
JRPGs originated on game consoles in Japan. These games often blend genres like fantasy and science fiction, with a focus on party management and exploring dramatic relationships within a ""save the world"" storyline.

Notable JRPGs include the Final Fantasy series, Dragon Quest series, Persona series, and Tales of series.

Conclusion
Role-playing games offer a diverse range of experiences and styles, catering to various preferences. Whether you prefer online multiplayer adventures, action-packed combat, immersive single-player narratives, or Japanese-inspired storytelling, there's an RPG out there for you. So go ahead, dive into the world of role-playing games, and embark on epic adventures that will captivate your imagination and keep you entertained for hours on end.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fb562b1ede4feb9fc02f0c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1795,1010,x0,y92,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 12:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/techcrunch-mobility-the-wheels-are-starting-to-come-off-the-fisker-ev-bus/,TechCrunch Mobility: The wheels are starting to come off the Fisker EV bus,"TechCrunch Mobility is a weekly newsletter that focuses on transportation news and insights. In this edition, we'll be discussing the latest updates on the Biden Administration's proposed standards for U.S. automakers, as well as some interesting developments in the EV startup space. So let's dive in!

The Biden Administration recently released two proposed standards through the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that will have a significant impact on U.S. automakers and consumers. While these regulations have been slightly softened to appease various stakeholders, they still impose stricter standards than before.

The DOE introduced a new ""petroleum equivalency factor"" that assigns a score to electric vehicles (EVs) under the government's corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. The original proposal would have made it challenging for automakers to meet these standards, resulting in hefty fines. However, the new proposal provides some relief for automakers.

On the other hand, the EPA announced its tailpipe standards for 2027 to 2032 model year cars and light-duty trucks. These standards impose more rigorous requirements on automakers but allow for flexibility in meeting them through different powertrain options. This technology-agnostic approach is less stringent than the initial proposal, which aimed for EVs to make up 67% of the U.S. passenger vehicle market by 2032.

While these standards have minimal impact on EV startups like Rivian, Tesla, and Lucid, they do pose challenges for legacy automakers. These companies are investing heavily in EV development but still rely on profits from internal combustion engine vehicles. In this context, plug-in hybrids may emerge as winners.

In other news, Rivian, the electric vehicle manufacturer, has recently partnered with Tesla. This collaboration aims to leverage Rivian's expertise in EV manufacturing and Tesla's market presence to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles.

We also have an interesting update on Candela, an electric boat startup. The company raised $25 million in funding led by Groupe Beneteau, signaling growing interest in the electrification of marine transportation.

Meanwhile, Fisker, another EV startup, is facing financial challenges. The company has experienced significant fallout and is struggling to secure new investments. However, Fisker remains hopeful and is actively seeking buyers for its assets.

Additionally, there's exciting news from Moove, an African mobility fintech company that provides vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers. The company recently raised $100 million in a Series B funding round led by Uber. This investment aligns with Uber's commitment to transitioning to a fully zero-emission fleet by 2040.

Lastly, we have a tip for you. Clevon, a company specializing in autonomous delivery technology, is reportedly in talks for a merger with an American electric vehicle company. While details are scarce, this development indicates potential growth in the autonomous vehicle sector.

That concludes this week's edition of TechCrunch Mobility. Stay tuned for more exciting updates on the future of transportation.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1363022906.jpg?resize=1200,730",2024-03-24 19:00:33,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/24/when-to-see-a-great-un-american-eclipse---from-iceland-to-australia/,When To See A ‘Great Un-American Eclipse’ - From Spain To Australia,"On Monday, April 8, a total solar eclipse will occur in North America, marking a significant moment for celestial events on Earth. In 2017, around 12 million Americans experienced totality, and on April 8, 2024, an estimated 31 million will have the opportunity to witness this extraordinary phenomenon. 
While the next total solar eclipse on U.S. soil won't occur until 2033 in Alaska, followed by 2044 in Montana and the Dakotas, there is no need to wait that long if you are willing to travel. 
During a total solar eclipse, only a small part of the Earth's surface is covered by the moon's shadow. Within this shadow, known as the path of totality, you can experience sudden darkness during the day, a rapid drop in temperature, a unique and eerie light, peculiar animal behavior, and a chance to see the sun's corona. To have this experience, you must be in the right place at the right time, often requiring travel to various locations around the world. Here are some future total solar eclipses to look forward to after April 8:

1. Greenland, Iceland, and Northern Spain Eclipse: August 12, 2026
This eclipse will offer a two-minute totality, and Iceland, particularly the western tip of the Snæfellsnes Peninsula and Reykjavik, will be excellent places to witness the event. Northern Spain will also be a popular option, although the eclipse will occur dangerously close to sunset, making it appear low in the sky.

2. North African Eclipse: August 2, 2027
This eclipse will feature a massive totality of six minutes or more, making it the longest one left in this century. The path of totality will cross southern Spain and much of North Africa. Luxor in Egypt, known for the Valley of the Kings and Karnak, will be the ideal location to experience six minutes and 20 seconds of totality.

3. Australia and New Zealand Eclipse: July 22, 2028
Sydney Harbour in Australia will be the prime spot to observe this eclipse, with a totality of three minutes and 44 seconds. However, if you want to ensure a clear sky, exploring the Australian Outback is highly recommended. Queenstown in New Zealand will also witness totality close to sunset.

4. Southern Africa and South Australia Eclipse: November 25, 2030
Southern Africa will provide an excellent destination to experience a two-minute totality before embarking on a game drive in Namibia and Botswana. South Australia will witness the eclipse about an hour before sunset. Which continent appeals to you?

5. Pacific Ocean Eclipse: November 14, 2031
To witness this hybrid solar eclipse, a long and solitary cruise from Hawaii will be necessary. The spectacle will transition from a ""ring fire"" annular solar eclipse to a total solar eclipse southeast of Hawaii, and then back again.

6. Alaska and Siberia Eclipse: March 30, 2033
This eclipse will offer a two-minute totality from Alaska and an opportunity to see the Northern Lights. While clear skies for the Great Bering Strait eclipse are unlikely, it provides a chance to explore remote Alaskan towns like Barrow/Utqiagvik, Prudhoe Bay/Sagavanirktok, and Kotzebue. If the weather cooperates, the northern lights might make an appearance during totality.

7. Central Africa and Asia Eclipse: March 20, 2034
This will be the first ""equinox eclipse"" since 2015, and the path of totality will provide four minutes and nine seconds of totality in Central Africa and South Asia. Southeastern Egypt is an excellent place to go, and many eclipse chasers will flock there for this extended eclipse. The UNESCO World Heritage Site of Persopolis in Iran is another option. The path of totality will pass through Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, Sudan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Nepal.

8. China, North Korea, and Japan Eclipse: September 2, 2035
To witness this East Asian eclipse, Beijing, China, or Tokyo, Japan, will be the places to go. Just north of Beijing and Pyongyang in North Korea, there will be almost two minutes of totality, while a trip just north of Tokyo will provide an additional 30 seconds.

9. Australia and New Zealand Eclipse: July 13, 2037
A mid-winter eclipse Down Under will cast places like Geraldton, Uluru (Ayers Rock), Byron Bay, the Gold Coast, and the remote Lord Howe Island into the moon's shadow for as long as three minutes and 58 seconds. The North Island of New Zealand will also be included, featuring the Ngauruhoe volcano (Mount Doom in The Lord of the Rings films) in Tongariro National Park and coastal Napier in Hawke's Bay.

10. Australia and New Zealand Eclipse: December 26, 2038
If you haven't exhausted your air miles from previous events, this mid-summer eclipse will primarily occur over the remote Australian Outback. However, the path of totality will pass just north of both Australia and New Zealand, offering another opportunity to witness this incredible phenomenon.

These upcoming total solar eclipses provide an extraordinary chance to witness a truly awe-inspiring event. Whether you choose to travel to Greenland, Iceland, Spain, North Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Africa, Asia, or even Alaska, each eclipse offers a unique experience that will leave you in awe of the natural wonders of our universe. So start planning your travels and mark your calendars for these future celestial spectacles.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6596ce996dfc8e3f5f161c42/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 13:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
