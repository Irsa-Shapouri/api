https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-concrete-possibilities-materials.html,New concrete possibilities from waste materials,"The use of recycled concrete and glass aggregates in concrete production is a promising solution for increasing the recycling rate of waste materials. However, durability issues have been a concern when using certain combinations of recycled ingredients. Researchers from Flinders University and other international institutions have developed a sustainable concrete formula that can resist alkali-silica reaction (ASR), which negatively impacts the mechanical properties and durability of concrete due to the high silica content of some recycled aggregates.

To mitigate the negative effects of ASR on the mechanical properties and durability of concrete made with crushed glass sand and coarse recycled concrete aggregate (RCA), the researchers focused on a blend of ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) and fly ash as binder materials. GGBS is a by-product of the iron-making process, while fly ash is a by-product of coal combustion in power stations. The results of the study showed that fly ash is more effective than GGBS in reducing the ASR expansion of the concrete.

The research also found that combining 20% GGBS with 30% fly ash in recycled aggregate concrete containing glass sand leads to similar compressive and flexural strengths and water absorption compared to concrete containing natural sand. However, increasing the GGBS content results in a decrease in strengths and an increase in water absorption.

Dr. Aliakbar Gholampour, an expert in the development of sustainable construction materials from Flinders University, emphasizes the potential of combining fly ash and GGBS at an optimal ratio to mitigate the ASR effect on recycled aggregate concrete containing crushed glass sand. This technology can be applied in various applications such as road construction, landscaping, and infrastructure projects, replacing the use of natural sand or gravel. By incorporating these recycled materials into construction and manufacturing practices, industries can contribute to a more sustainable built environment and circular economy. Furthermore, this approach helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants associated with cement production and conserves natural resources by minimizing the depletion of natural sand and coarse aggregate.

The research findings also highlight the following:

- Replacing natural sand with glass sand leads to a significant ASR expansion of mortar bars. However, replacing 30% of cement with fly ash reduces the expansion rate of the bars by 88%. The effectiveness of GGBS in reducing this expansion is lower, with only a 3%, 9%, and 12% decrease in expansion when adding 20%, 40%, and 70% GGBS to the concrete containing 30% fly ash, respectively.

- Replacing natural sand with glass sand results in a 37% decrease in compressive strength and a 20% decrease in flexural strength of concrete. However, incorporating 30% fly ash leads to an 18% increase in compressive strength and a 10% increase in flexural strength of ASR-affected RCA concrete with glass sand. Notably, combining 20% GGBS with 30% fly ash produces similar strengths to RCA concrete with natural sand.

- ASR-affected RCA concrete with glass sand exhibits a 67% higher water absorption compared to concrete made with natural sand. Incorporating 30% fly ash with 20% GGBS results in similar water absorption as concrete with natural sand. However, further increasing the GGBS content leads to an increase in water absorption.

- Incorporating 20% GGBS significantly improves the chloride attack resistance of ASR-affected RCA concrete with glass sand. However, increasing the GGBS content from 20% to 70% results in a 27% increase in chloride ion penetration of the concrete.

In conclusion, the research conducted by the team from Flinders University and other international institutions demonstrates the potential of using recycled concrete and glass aggregates in concrete production. By utilizing a blend of GGBS and fly ash, it is possible to mitigate the negative effects of ASR on the mechanical properties and durability of concrete. This sustainable approach not only contributes to a more circular economy and reduces environmental pollution but also helps preserve natural resources. The findings of this study provide valuable insights for the construction industry and pave the way for further development and implementation of sustainable construction materials.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/new-concrete-possibili-1.jpg,2024-03-26 10:05:25,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.zdnet.com/article/ive-tested-tons-of-android-office-suites-and-these-3-are-good-as-googles-if-not-better/,I've tested tons of Android office suites and these 3 are good as Google's (if not better),"In the past, there used to be numerous office suite options available for Android on the Google Play Store. Unfortunately, some of these apps are no longer accessible due to competition or lack of funding, while others turned out to be malicious. However, amidst all the changes, three office suite apps have consistently proven to be reliable and trustworthy alternatives to Google and Microsoft Office.

If you're looking for an office suite that offers excellent compatibility with Microsoft documents, a user-friendly interface, and all the necessary features for a comprehensive office experience on your Android device, WPS Office is a great choice. I have personally used WPS Office not only on Android but also on Linux, and it has always delivered exceptional performance. With WPS Office, you can create and edit Word documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and even PDFs. It also offers cloud storage, online editing, templates, file-sharing, document merging, file compressing, and more. What sets WPS Office apart is its modern and intuitive interface, making document creation and editing a breeze. Additionally, you can access all your saved documents from any device that has WPS Office installed, thanks to its cloud storage option. The best part is that WPS Office is available for free on Android devices.

Another noteworthy office suite option is Polaris Office. Similar to WPS Office, Polaris Office allows you to create and edit MS Word documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and flat text documents. It also supports HWPX files, which are the proprietary Hangul Word Processor document format. Polaris Office offers features such as activity tracking, filters, full-text search, file conversion and sharing, offline access, and cloud storage. The user interface of Polaris Office is slightly different, with a dial that allows you to create various document types. You can access your saved documents from device storage, Polaris Drive, or other cloud storage platforms like Google Drive, Box, Dropbox, OneDrive, or WebDAV. However, it's worth noting that the free version of Polaris Office includes ads, but you can choose from different paid versions to remove them. The pricing options range from $1.99/month to $6.49/month, depending on the features you need.

If you're looking for a more professional office suite experience, OfficeSuite Pro is an excellent choice. This suite includes all the necessary document types like documents, sheets, slides, and PDFs, along with 50GB of cloud storage. The user interface of OfficeSuite Pro is good, although not as clean as WPS Office. It offers a wide range of features, including PDF export, conversion, and annotation, conversion to ePub, up to 5GB of free MobiDrive storage, customized fonts, push notifications, dictionary lookup, proofing options, and more. However, it's important to note that OfficeSuite Pro does not have a free option with editing capabilities. You can start a 15-day free trial, but you'll need to provide a credit card number and remember to cancel your subscription if you don't wish to continue. The pricing options for OfficeSuite Pro vary from $39.99/year for a personal license to $99.99/year for a Home & Business license.

Out of these three options, my personal recommendation is WPS Office. Not only does it have a superior user interface, but it also offers a free version that meets all your office needs on Android. With its extensive features, compatibility with Microsoft documents, and cloud storage option, WPS Office is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a reliable and user-friendly office suite on their Android device.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/a72ac9801cb884fa6cb29d0283b027ccda127c79/2024/03/26/5516bfac-6bb6-4fdb-826d-0023de1cd65d/gettyimages-1250241826.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-26 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
