Riot Games recently unveiled Clove, the highly-anticipated 25th agent in the popular game Valorant. With an array of interesting abilities, Clove is set to bring a fresh dynamic to the game. As a controller, Clove's main focus is on disrupting enemies and providing utility for their team. However, what sets Clove apart is their ability to come back from the dead. Let's take a closer look at Clove's abilities and how they can be utilized in the game.

One of Clove's abilities is Ruse, activated by pressing the E key. This ability allows players to create smoke screens similar to Brimstone's smoke ability. By bringing up a small window on the screen, players can select the desired location for the smoke, blocking the enemy's vision. What makes Ruse unique is that it can also be used even when Clove is dead, making them more versatile than they may initially appear.

Another ability at Clove's disposal is Meddle, triggered by pressing the Q key. Meddle is a throwable grenade that inflicts decay on enemies hit by it. While this ability may seem less impactful compared to others, it still has its strategic uses and can be effective when utilized effectively.

Clove's C ability is Pick-Me-Up, which bears similarities to Reyna's kit. When Clove eliminates an enemy, they can absorb their life essence, gaining haste and a temporary health buff. This ability adds a layer of sustainability to Clove's gameplay, allowing them to stay in the fight longer.

Now, let's talk about Clove's ultimate ability, which truly sets them apart. When Clove dies and has their ultimate ability ready, they have the option to quickly cast it and come back to life for a short period. If Clove manages to secure a kill or assists in damaging an enemy during this resurrection period, they will be fully revived as if they had never died. However, if they fail to get a kill or assist, they will return to the grave once the resurrection timer runs out.

Clove's abilities make them a valuable asset even in defeat. With the ability to come back to life and gain extra health through their ultimate, as well as the smokes that can be utilized post-death, Clove can still contribute significantly to the team. This makes them an excellent entry fragger, as the risk of dying is significantly mitigated.

According to Dan Hardison, the agent gameplay designer on Valorant, optimal Clove gameplay revolves around taking risks and sacrificing themselves for the greater good. Removing enemy utility by eliminating opponents is crucial for success. While Clove's raw execute utility may be weaker on average compared to other controllers, their ability to contribute post-death makes them a force to be reckoned with. Hardison emphasizes the importance of fighting to the death and being traded by an ally, as 1 for 1 trades work in Clove's favor, especially if their life is traded for a non-Clove opponent. Playing Clove requires a willingness to die for the squad.

In conclusion, Clove is an exciting addition to the Valorant roster of agents. With their disruptive abilities and the ability to come back from the dead, Clove brings a unique playstyle to the game. Whether it's utilizing smokes, inflicting decay on enemies, or making strategic sacrifices for the team, Clove offers a fresh and engaging gameplay experience. Get ready to embrace the risk and reward of playing with fire as you master the art of Clove in Valorant.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff3fefa4d4cfc35a9fc1fe/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 11:15:00,Innovation,Innovation

She is also a member of the East Suburban Atlanta Chapter of Jack and Jill of America, Inc. Dr. Dowe organized the event and invited me to speak. The goal was to inspire and expose young students, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds, to the world of STEM.

As I stood in front of those eager faces, I couldn't help but feel a sense of responsibility. I wanted to show them that there are scientists who look like them, who have overcome obstacles and achieved success in their fields. I shared my own journey, from a young boy with a passion for insects and weather to a seasoned atmospheric scientist. I emphasized the importance of curiosity, perseverance, and finding mentors who can guide and inspire.

It was heartwarming to see the students' eyes light up as I talked about the wonders of science. I showed them how weather impacts our daily lives, from the clothes we wear to the activities we engage in. I also highlighted the importance of scientific research in addressing climate change and its impact on vulnerable communities. My goal was to make science relatable and relevant to their lives.

Throughout the event, I encouraged the students to ask questions and explore their own interests in STEM. I wanted them to know that there are countless opportunities in these fields, whether it's studying insects, exploring the mysteries of the universe, or finding innovative solutions to global challenges. I wanted them to see that their dreams are valid and achievable.

But I also acknowledged the barriers and challenges that exist. I discussed the lack of representation in STEM and the negative perceptions that still persist. I shared statistics that showed the underrepresentation of Black students in STEM degrees and the low perception of Black achievement in these fields. I wanted the students to understand that they may face obstacles, but they have the power to overcome them.

To address these challenges, I emphasized the need for increased visibility of diverse role models in STEM. It's important for young students to see people who look like them succeeding in these fields. I also stressed the importance of mentorship, both in providing guidance and support and in fostering a sense of belonging. Mentors can help students navigate the complexities of academia and provide valuable insights and opportunities.

Furthermore, I highlighted the importance of changing cultural perceptions of successful careers. Many students are often encouraged to pursue traditional paths, such as law or business, instead of considering STEM. We need to show them that STEM careers are just as fulfilling and impactful.

In addition, I discussed the importance of retention efforts to keep students and professionals engaged in STEM. It's not enough to attract students to these fields; we need to create inclusive environments where they feel welcomed and supported. This means addressing issues of bias and discrimination and creating spaces where all ideas and perspectives are valued.

The event was a success, not just because of the knowledge I shared, but because of the connections I made. I saw the potential in those young faces and the spark of curiosity in their eyes. I hope that my words and the experiences I shared will stay with them as they navigate their own journeys in STEM.

As I left the event, I couldn't help but feel a renewed sense of purpose. I realized that my role as a scientist extends beyond my research and publications. It's about inspiring and empowering the next generation of scientists, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds. It's about creating a more diverse and inclusive STEM community where everyone's voices are heard and valued.

I am grateful for the opportunity to engage with those vibrant students and to be a part of their journey. I hope that my story and the lessons I shared will serve as a reminder that anyone can pursue a career in STEM, regardless of their background or circumstances. And I hope that one day, these students will become the role models and mentors for future generations, continuing the cycle of inspiration and empowerment.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660034c3235190ae18aa9cf0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 11:18:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have a lot in common when it comes to their growth trajectories. Both companies have seen explosive revenue growth in recent years, driven by their core businesses that emerged from unexpected opportunities. AWS realized it could sell its internal services, while Nvidia discovered that its GPU, originally created for gaming, was well-suited for AI workloads.

Nvidia's revenue has been growing at an astounding rate, reaching $22.1 billion in Q4 2024 from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024. However, most of this growth came from the company's data center business. On the other hand, AWS has consistently been a major revenue driver for Amazon, but its growth has started to slow down. Microsoft and Google have also entered the cloud market, and it's expected that other chip makers will gain market share in the future.

Both Nvidia and AWS were in the right place at the right time. As web apps and mobile emerged, the cloud became a valuable resource for enterprises. Similarly, the rise of AI coincided with the increased use of GPUs to process AI workloads.

While AWS has become a highly profitable business, Nvidia's growth is just starting. The question is whether Nvidia can sustain its growth and become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS. If the GPU market tightens, Nvidia does have other businesses, but they generate much smaller revenues compared to the data center business.

In the short term, Nvidia's revenue growth is expected to continue. The company anticipates $24 billion in revenue for its current quarter, a 234% increase compared to the same period last year. However, its growth rate is expected to decline as the company's revenue ramps up. Analysts predict Nvidia will generate $110.5 billion in revenue for the current fiscal year, an 81% increase from last year, but lower than the 126% gain it posted in the previous fiscal year.

Despite the expected growth declines, Nvidia is still poised for significant growth in the coming years. AI is likely to be a major driver of growth, even with increased competition from other chip makers. Nvidia currently controls a large portion of the market and can afford to face stiffer competition in the future.

At the chip level, Nvidia remains firmly in control, according to IDC. However, AMD is gaining ground at the board level, as indicated by market share numbers from Jon Peddie Research. While Nvidia still dominates, AMD is becoming a stronger competitor.

In conclusion, both Nvidia and AWS have experienced impressive growth, but Nvidia's future growth potential seems promising, especially in the AI market. With its current market dominance and strong positioning, Nvidia is expected to continue growing its revenue significantly, although the growth rate may slow down in the coming years.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2024/03/24/unveiling-the-journey-of-a-social-media-influencer/,Unveiling The Journey Of A Social Media Influencer,"How I Became a Social Media Influencer and Transformed My Life

Social media has become an integral part of our lives, and it's hard to deny its influence and impact. As someone who has navigated this digital realm, I can confidently say that becoming a social media influencer has transformed my life in ways I never could have imagined.

Like many others, I initially saw social media as a platform to share my random thoughts and selfies. I didn't fully comprehend its potential or the power it held. However, that all changed when I started sharing my personal experiences, strengths, and hopes with others.

It was during this transformative phase that I saw my following grow exponentially. The key to this growth was vulnerability and relatability. By opening myself up and sharing my authentic self, I was able to connect with thousands of people who resonated with my content.

Of course, social media isn't without its flaws. It has gained a reputation for being a breeding ground for negativity and online bullying. Witnessing this dark side made me question how I wanted to use my platform. That's when I developed my personal formula of three essential questions: Will this be helpful? Is this something I want to put out into the world? Is this something I need to hear myself? If the answer to all three is yes, then I share it.

Following this formula has had a profound impact on my life and the lives of my followers. It has allowed me to create a positive and supportive online community, free from hate and negativity. My catchphrase, ""Negativity Be Gone,"" has become a shield against any negativity that may come my way.

By consciously choosing positivity and focusing on uplifting content, I've transformed my online presence into a breath of fresh air. My followers appreciate the safe space I've created, and it has become the foundation for building my career as an influencer.

Being an influencer has not only provided me with a fulfilling career, but it has also opened doors to endless opportunities for growth. Through social media, I have gained knowledge, connected with like-minded individuals, and formed valuable relationships. It's truly remarkable how this digital landscape has the power to bring people together and foster meaningful connections.

Of course, being an influencer isn't always a smooth ride. Many influencers face hate and negativity on a daily basis. I consider myself fortunate to have created a shield against such negativity. However, I recognize that this shield doesn't eradicate negativity; it simply means I no longer welcome it into my life.

Stepping into the world of social media has been a transformative journey for me. I've learned valuable lessons along the way, and I continue to grow and evolve as an influencer. Through my platform, I strive to inspire and uplift others, creating a ripple effect of positivity in an often chaotic online world.

In conclusion, becoming a social media influencer has had a profound impact on my life. It has allowed me to connect with others on a deep level, share my story, and create a positive community. Social media, when used with intention and authenticity, has the power to transform lives and empower individuals to make a difference in the world.
