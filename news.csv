Bluesky Unveils Ozone: Empowering Users with Unprecedented Control over Social Media

Bluesky, the decentralized Twitter/X rival, has taken a bold step towards revolutionizing social media moderation. The company has open-sourced Ozone, a tool that allows individuals and teams to collaboratively review and label content on the network.

A Stackable Ecosystem of Moderation Services

Bluesky envisions a future where moderation is not a one-size-fits-all approach. Instead, it proposes a stackable ecosystem of services, where users can install filters from independent moderation services on top of Bluesky's default moderation.

This empowers users to create a customized social media experience tailored to their unique preferences and sensitivities. For instance, users who fear spiders can subscribe to a moderation service that blocks images of these eight-legged creatures.

Collaborative Curation and Reporting

Ozone goes beyond traditional mute or block lists. It enables collaborative curation and reporting. Individuals and teams can create moderation services that allow users to report unlabeled content. This eliminates the need for direct tagging and enables more efficient and effective moderation.

Moderation services are not tied to individual accounts, allowing multiple people to manage them together. This opens up the possibility for community-run projects, as well as paid subscription services.

Empowering Experts, Developers, and Users

Bluesky believes that no single team can perfectly moderate content for the diverse global community. By opening up the ecosystem, it empowers experts, developers, and users to contribute their local context and preferences.

This approach fosters a more nuanced and inclusive moderation experience, where users can choose services that align with their values and beliefs.

Availability and Future Plans

Ozone is currently available on the desktop version of Bluesky and will soon be rolled out to mobile devices. Installing filters from independent moderation services is as simple as following another account.

Bluesky's vision extends beyond individual moderation services. The company plans to introduce a ""moderation marketplace"" where users can discover and subscribe to a wide range of services. This will further enhance the customization and flexibility of the social media experience.

Conclusion

Bluesky's Ozone tool is a game-changer in the world of social media moderation. It empowers users with unprecedented control over their content, fostering a more personalized and inclusive online environment. By embracing collaboration and community involvement, Bluesky is paving the way for a future where moderation is tailored to the needs of each individual user.

Innovation in the Racquet Sports Landscape

Volley stands out in the racquet sports tech space with its unique combination of video recording and ball dispensing. Its AI-driven approach simulates live gameplay, providing an unparalleled training experience.

He ingeniously mounted a tennis ball machine on painter sticks to mimic specific shots. After three years of tireless prototyping, Volley's game-changing trainer was born.

The Future of Racquet Sports Training

Volley is constantly evolving, adding new features to enhance your training experience. The upcoming hand gestures feature will allow you to control the trainer without even touching your phone.

Expanding Reach and Impact

Since its launch in September 2023, Volley has quickly gained traction, with 1,007 app installs and trainers deployed in 45 clubs across the US. The company has partnered with the American Platform Tennis Association to further expand its reach.

Unlocking the Power of Usage-Based Pricing: How OpenMeter Empowers Businesses

In the realm of enterprise software, usage-based pricing is taking center stage. This billing model allows customers to pay only for what they use, offering flexibility and cost efficiency. However, keeping track of usage and billing can be a challenge.

The Rise of Usage-Based Pricing

Today, an estimated 60% of SaaS businesses offer usage-based pricing. Industry giants like Apigee and Autodesk have embraced this model, recognizing its benefits. But with this shift comes the need for a reliable way to monitor usage and ensure accurate billing.

Enter OpenMeter: The Usage-Based Billing Solution

OpenMeter, a company founded by former Stripe engineer Peter Marton, aims to solve the metering challenges associated with usage-based pricing. Built on Apache Kafka, an open-source platform for real-time data processing, OpenMeter tracks usage across a company's tech stack.

Key Features of OpenMeter

 Usage Event Processing: OpenMeter processes ""usage events"" to create human-readable consumption metrics.
 Billing and Finance Integration: These metrics are integrated with billing and finance dashboards for easy billing and revenue tracking.
 CRM Integration: Usage data is also fed into customer relationship management (CRM) databases to provide insights to product and revenue teams.
 Usage and Rate Limit Enforcement: OpenMeter can enforce usage and rate limits to prevent overconsumption and ensure fair billing.
 Hybrid Pricing Support: It supports both usage-based and hybrid pricing models, offering flexibility in billing options.

OpenMeter's Competitive Edge

In a crowded market of metering solutions, OpenMeter stands out with its unique features:

 Open Source: OpenMeter's software is freely available, making it accessible to businesses of all sizes.
 Composability: Its modular architecture allows engineering teams to incrementally adopt the solution without disrupting existing systems.
 Focus on Engineers: OpenMeter prioritizes the needs of engineers, providing a platform that empowers them to control costs and optimize usage.

Early Success and Future Prospects

OpenMeter has gained early traction, securing $3 million in funding and attracting market-leading AI companies as customers. The economic downturn has further fueled the demand for usage-based pricing and cost control, creating a favorable environment for OpenMeter's growth.

Conclusion

Usage-based pricing offers significant advantages, but it also presents billing challenges. OpenMeter addresses these challenges with its innovative platform, empowering businesses to embrace usage-based pricing with confidence. As the adoption of this pricing model continues to grow, OpenMeter is well-positioned to become a key player in the enterprise software landscape.

https://www.engadget.com/japans-space-one-rocket-launch-attempt-ends-in-a-fiery-explosion-104937369.html,Japan's Space One rocket launch attempt ends in a fiery explosion,"

Space One's Ambitious Rocket Launch Ends in a Blaze

In a bold endeavor, Space One, a Japanese startup, embarked on a mission to become the first private entity in Japan to launch a satellite into orbit. However, their aspirations were met with a fiery setback as their rocket, Kairos, exploded mere seconds after liftoff.

The 60-foot-long rocket ascended from Space Port Kii in Wakayama, Japan, carrying a satellite for the Cabinet Satellite Intelligence Center. The satellite was intended to monitor military facilities and rocket launches in North Korea.

The Anomaly and the Aftermath

Space One's director, Mamoru Endo, revealed that the rocket's automated system detected an anomaly five seconds after liftoff, triggering its self-destruct function. The cause of the anomaly remains unknown, and the company is conducting a thorough investigation.

Despite the setback, Space One's president, Masakazu Toyoda, expressed resilience. He acknowledged the prevalence of failed launches in space exploration and emphasized the company's determination to persevere.

The Road Ahead for Space One

Backed by Canon and aerospace giant IHI, Space One aims to provide cost-effective and flexible satellite launch services using small rockets. The company aspires to offer the fastest turnaround time and the most frequent launch schedule in the industry.

While Space One's initial attempt ended in disappointment, it serves as a reminder of the challenges and risks inherent in space travel. The company must now focus on identifying and resolving the anomaly that caused the explosion.

Japan's Space Ambitions

Space One's failed launch highlights the competitive nature of the private space industry in Japan. Last year, ispace, another Japanese company, faced a similar setback when it lost contact with its lunar lander, Hakuto-R.

Despite these setbacks, Japan's space agency, JAXA, continues to make strides. Its SLIM lunar lander successfully landed on the Moon in January and is preparing to resume operations.

Conclusion

Space One's failed rocket launch is a sobering reminder of the complexities of space exploration. However, it also underscores the resilience and determination of those who dare to push the boundaries of human ingenuity. As Space One and other private companies continue to innovate and learn, the future of space travel holds both promise and peril.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-intel-approach-boost-power-efficiency.html,"Intel introduces approach to boost power efficiency, reliability of packaged chiplet ecosystems","

Unveiling the Power of Chiplet Interconnects: A New Era of Computing Performance

In the realm of computing, the integration of electronic components has undergone a remarkable transformation. From the humble beginnings of central processing units (CPUs) connected to memory units, we've witnessed the rise of sophisticated integrated circuit (IC) architectures that harness the power of multiple chiplets.

Intel Corporation has been at the forefront of this evolution, introducing innovative architectures and specifications for systems featuring multiple packaged chiplets. Recently, researchers at Intel Santa Clara have proposed a groundbreaking approach that promises to revolutionize the performance of these systems.

Beyond the Limits of Frequency: Embracing Lower Frequencies for Enhanced Efficiency

Traditionally, the pursuit of higher performance in electronic systems has been synonymous with increasing the frequency of circuits. However, Intel's latest research challenges this long-held belief.

The team has discovered that by reducing the frequency in UCIe (Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express) systems, a specification that standardizes connections between chiplets, they can achieve significant gains in both power efficiency and overall performance.

The Intriguing Case of Bump Pitches

Advances in silicon and packaging technology have enabled the reduction of bump pitches, the minimum distance between the bumps connecting individual chips on circuit boards. This reduction in bump pitch means more wires can be accommodated between chiplets.

Counterintuitively, the researchers found that instead of increasing the frequency as the number of wires increases, lowering the frequency in UCIe-aligned technologies leads to improved power efficiency and performance.

A New Frontier for Computing Performance

This groundbreaking discovery opens up exciting possibilities for the future of computing. By embracing lower frequencies in chiplet-based systems, designers can unlock unprecedented levels of performance while simultaneously reducing power consumption.

This approach has the potential to revolutionize a wide range of applications, from high-performance computing to energy-efficient mobile devices.

The Road Ahead: Standardization and Industry Collaboration

Intel's researchers believe that their findings can benefit the broader industry through the standardization of chiplet interconnects. By working together, the industry can accelerate the adoption of this transformative technology and drive the next generation of computing innovation.

As the journey of chiplets and UCIe continues, the future holds immense promise for the advancement of computing performance and efficiency. Intel's groundbreaking research has set the stage for a new era of innovation, where the boundaries of computing are constantly being pushed.

Telo Trucks: Revolutionizing the Pickup Landscape for Fleets and Lifestyle Enthusiasts

In the realm of automotive innovation, Telo Trucks has emerged as a trailblazer, capturing the attention of both everyday drivers and fleet managers alike with its pint-sized electric pickup. While the company initially targeted individuals seeking a compact, convenient lifestyle vehicle, an unexpected surge of interest from fleet operators has propelled Telo into uncharted territory.

Fleet Customers Embrace the Mini Pickup

Fleet managers, particularly those operating in urban environments, have long lamented the scarcity of small trucks in the market. Traditional pickup trucks have grown in size and price, leaving a void for vehicles that can navigate congested city streets and fulfill specific fleet requirements.

Telo's pint-sized pickup has filled this gap, offering a solution that eliminates the need for fleet companies to purchase both neighborhood electric vehicles and full-size pickups to meet their diverse operational needs. This unique opportunity has fueled Telo's growth, attracting a growing number of fleet customers.

Funding Fueling Development and Expansion

To capitalize on this demand, Telo has secured a $5.4 million funding round led by Neo and Spero Ventures. The investment will enable the company to forge deeper relationships with potential fleet customers and develop fully functional press vehicles that showcase the final product's design and performance.

Overcoming Technical Hurdles

Creating a compact pickup that meets safety standards poses unique engineering challenges. Telo's team is exploring innovative solutions beyond traditional crumple zones to protect occupants in the event of a crash. By utilizing the space where an engine would typically reside, they aim to enhance occupant safety without compromising the vehicle's compact design.

Production Strategy: Small-Scale, Niche Focus

To ensure profitability and avoid the pitfalls that have plagued other automotive startups, Telo is adopting a low-volume production strategy. The company plans to utilize off-the-shelf components with minimal modifications and collaborate with domestic contract manufacturers specializing in smaller-scale production.

This approach allows Telo to target specific use cases and niches where they face minimal competition. By focusing on low volumes, they can achieve profitability and minimize the risks associated with mass production.

Conclusion

Telo Trucks has tapped into a growing demand for compact, electric pickups, attracting both lifestyle enthusiasts and fleet customers. With its innovative design, strategic partnerships, and a focus on low-volume production, Telo is poised to revolutionize the pickup landscape. As the company continues to develop its pint-sized pickup, it will undoubtedly face challenges, but its unique approach and unwavering commitment to meeting the needs of its customers position it for success in the years to come.
