https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-deep-geothermal-renewable-powerhouse.html,Dig deep: US bets on geothermal to become renewable powerhouse,"Geothermal energy is gaining attention as a potential solution for a greener future in the United States. Despite currently only accounting for a small fraction of the country's energy production, businesses and the Biden administration are optimistic about its potential. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm believes that geothermal energy could become the clean, reliable, and scalable power source for industries and households alike. In fact, the Department of Energy estimates that geothermal energy could surpass hydroelectric and solar power by 2050.

Geothermal energy utilizes the naturally high temperatures beneath the Earth's surface to produce electricity and heat buildings. However, it only contributed to 1.6 percent of US energy consumption in 2022. To increase production, the US government has invested over $200 million since 2018 in an experimental site in Utah. This site employs Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), a technology that involves drilling deep wells and injecting water into hot rocks to generate geothermal energy. Unlike traditional geothermal methods, EGS does not rely on nearby hot springs or underground reservoirs.

The advantage of EGS is that it can be implemented anywhere, reducing the upfront risk for investors. Additionally, the US government is streamlining the conversion of permits for oil or gas exploration into geothermal licenses, making the process more efficient. Compared to hydraulic fracturing (fracking), geothermal drilling uses fewer chemical additives and does not release hydrocarbons. Furthermore, geothermal energy provides a consistent energy supply regardless of weather conditions or time of day.

In terms of cost, the US government predicts that geothermal energy will become more affordable, with the price dropping from $70 to $100 per megawatt hour (MWh) to $45 by 2035. The use of existing drilling technology makes geothermal development quicker and cheaper. The US has been at the forefront of this technology, with other countries like France also exploring experimental EGS sites.

However, geothermal drilling projects, similar to fracking, can potentially cause seismic activity. The US Energy Department has implemented a mitigation protocol to address induced seismicity and is funding research on the issue. While there are risks involved, several start-ups in the US and Canada have raised significant investments and are competing in the geothermal market. Companies like Fervo Energy have already connected their geothermal sites to the electric grid and are attracting partnerships with major players like Google.

As the geothermal sector grows, demand is following suit. Companies like Google, Microsoft, and Nucor have announced their intention to purchase geothermal energy. The willingness of these large corporations to pay a premium for geothermal energy excites the private sector and encourages further investment. However, the market is still in its early stages, and the first successful commercial facility is yet to be established. Once that milestone is achieved, it is expected that more companies will enter the market.

In conclusion, geothermal energy holds promise as a clean and reliable power source in the United States. With technological advancements in Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) and government support, geothermal energy has the potential to surpass other renewable energy sources. It offers advantages such as reduced environmental impact, consistent energy supply, and the ability to be implemented anywhere. While there are challenges to overcome, the growing interest from major corporations and the potential for further market expansion indicate a bright future for geothermal energy.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/a-worker-operates-a-dr.jpg,2024-03-25 04:59:03,Innovation,Innovation

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-large-language-simple-mechanism-knowledge.html,Large language models use a surprisingly simple mechanism to retrieve some stored knowledge,"Large language models (LLMs) are incredibly complex systems that are used in various applications such as customer support, code generation, and language translation. However, scientists still have limited understanding of how these models work. To gain further insight, researchers from MIT and other institutions conducted a study to investigate the mechanisms employed by LLMs when retrieving stored knowledge.

Surprisingly, the researchers discovered that LLMs often utilize a simple linear function to decode and retrieve stored facts. Linear functions, which involve only two variables and no exponents, capture the direct relationship between these variables. It was also observed that the model employs the same decoding function for similar types of facts.

The researchers demonstrated that by identifying linear functions for different facts, they could explore the model's understanding of new subjects and determine where that knowledge is stored within the model. They developed a technique to estimate these simple functions and found that even when the model provides incorrect answers, it often retains the correct information. This approach could be useful in identifying and correcting false information within the model, thereby reducing the occurrence of incorrect or nonsensical responses.

Evan Hernandez, an electrical engineering and computer science graduate student at MIT and co-lead author of the research paper, emphasized the significance of this finding. He stated that despite the complexity of these models, there are instances where simple mechanisms operate within them. Hernandez collaborated with co-lead author Arnab Sharma, a computer science graduate student at Northeastern University, and advisors Jacob Andreas from MIT and David Bau from Northeastern University, along with other researchers from MIT, Harvard University, and the Israeli Institute of Technology.

Most large language models, also known as transformer models, are neural networks consisting of interconnected nodes or neurons grouped into multiple layers. These neural networks encode and process data, storing knowledge as relations between subjects and objects. For example, the relation ""Miles Davis plays the trumpet"" connects the subject (Miles Davis) with the object (trumpet). As the transformer gains more knowledge, it stores additional facts about a subject across different layers. When a user asks a question about a specific subject, the model must decode the most relevant fact to provide an appropriate response.

To understand how this decoding process occurs, the researchers conducted experiments on LLMs. Despite the complexity of these models, they found that the decoding of relational information relies on a simple linear function. Each function is specific to the type of fact being retrieved. For instance, the model would use one decoding function to output the instrument a person plays and a different function to output the state where a person was born.

The researchers developed a method to estimate these simple functions and computed functions for 47 different relations, such as ""capital city of a country"" and ""lead singer of a band."" Although there are countless possible relations, the researchers focused on this subset as they represent the types of facts that can be expressed in this manner.

The researchers tested each function by altering the subject and verifying if it could recover the correct object information. Their findings provide valuable insights into the inner workings of LLMs, shedding light on how these models retrieve and decode stored knowledge.

This research is a significant step towards understanding the mechanisms of large language models and could have implications for improving the accuracy and reliability of these systems. By identifying and correcting false information within the models, scientists can enhance their performance and ensure more accurate responses.

In conclusion, large language models utilize simple linear functions to retrieve and decode stored facts. Despite their complexity, these models contain mechanisms that researchers can explore to understand their internal workings. The ability to identify and correct false information within these models could lead to improved performance and more reliable responses. This research contributes to our understanding of large language models and paves the way for future advancements in the field.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/large-language-models-2.jpg,2024-03-25 09:34:06,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/fisker-trading-suspended-by-nyse/,Fisker trading suspended by NYSE,"The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) announced on Monday that it will suspend trading shares of electric vehicle (EV) startup Fisker and delist the company from its stock exchange. The NYSE stated that Fisker's stock is no longer suitable for listing due to abnormally low price levels. This decision comes after the NYSE warned Fisker last month that its stock price had been trading below $1 for 30 consecutive days, which violated the exchange's rules.

Fisker has the option to review the NYSE's determination, but the company expects its stock to be moved to an over-the-counter market, such as OTC Pink. However, this delisting has triggered repayment clauses in two outstanding loans that Fisker is currently unable to afford, potentially having a significant negative impact on the business.

It has been a challenging day for Fisker, with shares falling over 28% before trading was halted. Earlier in the day, Fisker announced the loss of a potential deal with a large automaker, rumored to be Nissan. This development has also put the company's recently announced attempt at securing emergency funding in jeopardy.

Fisker did not provide an explanation for why the automaker terminated the negotiations, which was a critical closing condition for a potential $150 million convertible note announced the previous week. Fisker stated in a filing that it will ask the unnamed investor to waive the closing condition.

Fisker has been facing escalating problems for months, including customer complaints, lawsuits, and federal investigations. The troubled EV startup has struggled to sell its Ocean SUV, falling short of its own internal sales goals. In an attempt to boost sales, Fisker shifted from a direct sales model to working with dealerships. However, the company has also struggled with quality issues that it has had difficulty resolving, as indicated by internal documents.

In February, Fisker laid off 15% of its staff, approximately 200 people, and recently reported having only $121 million in cash reserves. The company has halted production and warned investors that it will not survive another year without a significant cash infusion.

Please note that this story has been updated with information from Fisker's SEC filing on Monday afternoon.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fisker-GettyImages.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-25 21:06:18,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/bankrupt-ev-startup-arrival-sold-its-assets-to-canoo/,Bankrupt EV startup Arrival sold its assets to Canoo,"Bankrupt electric vehicle (EV) startup Arrival has sold some of its assets, including advanced manufacturing equipment, to struggling startup Canoo, which is also in the EV market. Canoo hopes that this acquisition will help reduce its capital expenditures by 20%. The purchased assets will be sent to Canoo's facility in Oklahoma. It is unclear whether Canoo has also acquired any of Arrival's intellectual property (IP).

Arrival, once valued at over $13 billion and backed by Hyundai and UPS, had plans to revolutionize EV production by building compact ""microfactories"" in city centers. However, the company faced financial difficulties and underwent several restructurings, resulting in layoffs and a shift in focus to the U.S. market. Arrival never managed to produce commercial vehicles at scale and ultimately filed for bankruptcy. Its market valuation now stands at around $7.7 million.

Canoo, on the other hand, has faced its own challenges. After going public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, the company struggled to produce its eye-catching EV design based on a ""skateboard"" architecture. Despite having over $1 billion in its sales pipeline, largely due to a deal with Walmart, Canoo has struggled to convert those sales into deliveries. The company has resorted to stock splits and issuing more shares to stay afloat.

The acquisition of Arrival's assets by Canoo is seen as a cost-saving measure for Canoo, as it continues to work towards commercial production. Canoo's struggles highlight the difficulties faced by many startups in the EV industry, where high capital costs and production challenges can hinder progress. However, with the right strategies and investments, these companies have the potential to succeed and contribute to the growth of the EV market.

In conclusion, the acquisition of Arrival's assets by Canoo presents an opportunity for both companies to overcome their respective challenges. Canoo hopes to benefit from the cost savings and advanced manufacturing equipment, while Arrival can generate some revenue from the sale of its assets. The EV industry is a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market, and success requires not only innovative designs but also efficient production processes and financial stability. Both Canoo and Arrival will need to navigate these challenges to establish themselves as key players in the EV market.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/canoo-walmart-arkansas.jpg?resize=1200,670",2024-03-25 22:15:20,Innovation,Innovation

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-pairing-crypto-green-hydrogen-energy.html,"Pairing crypto mining with green hydrogen offers clean energy boost, study suggests","Pairing cryptocurrency mining, which is known for its high carbon emissions, with green hydrogen technology could have a significant impact on the wider adoption of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power. This is the key finding of a recent study conducted by Cornell University.

The study, titled ""Climate Sustainability Through a Dynamic Duo: Green Hydrogen and Crypto Driving Energy Transition and Decarbonization,"" was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. It was authored by Professor Fengqi You, an expert in energy systems engineering, and Apoorv Lal, a doctoral student at Cornell.

Professor You emphasizes the importance of exploring opportunities to harness the enthusiasm surrounding cryptocurrency and channel it towards a sustainable future. The current operations of cryptocurrency mining contribute significantly to global carbon emissions. Therefore, it is crucial to find ways to align the cryptocurrency industry with renewable energy sources.

The researchers propose linking energy-intensive cryptocurrency mining with green hydrogen technology, which they refer to as the ""dynamic duo."" This combination can provide a boost to the renewable energy sector. By using clean energy sources to power blockchain mining operations and produce green hydrogen, the researchers believe that wind and solar capacity can be expanded, leading to increased sustainable energy production across the country.

According to a report from the White House Office of Science and Technology, the carbon-based energy used for mining blockchain-based cryptocurrency in the U.S. is equivalent to the energy consumption of the entire country of Argentina. The electricity consumption for cryptocurrency mining is estimated to represent between 0.6% and 2.3% of all electricity consumption in the U.S. in 2023.

Acknowledging the energy demands of cryptocurrency mining, the researchers propose an innovative technology solution. By leveraging cryptocurrencies as virtual energy carriers and utilizing green hydrogen, the environmental challenges posed by cryptocurrency mining can be transformed into a force for climate mitigation and sustainability.

In their research, Professor You and Mr. Lal analyzed individual U.S. states to identify their potential energy strengths. By supporting cryptocurrency mining, additional energy infrastructure can be developed, leading to the production of solar and wind power. For example, in New Mexico, each Bitcoin mined could potentially generate 78.4 megawatt hours of solar power, while in Wyoming, each Bitcoin mined could produce 265.8 megawatt hours of wind power.

Cryptocurrency, despite being intangible, holds value just like a gift card. Similarly, it can also hold an energy value. By integrating cryptocurrency with green hydrogen, a sustainable future for blockchain-based cryptocurrency can be advanced. However, stronger federal policies for climate goals and renewable energy are needed to support this transition.

This approach to cryptocurrency not only mitigates its environmental impact but also pioneers a sustainable path for renewable energy transition. It is a novel strategy that has the potential to revolutionize the cryptocurrency industry and contribute to a greener future.

Professor You is a senior faculty fellow at the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability, highlighting his expertise in sustainable energy solutions.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2023/cryptocurrencies.jpg,2024-03-25 15:00:02,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-method-quantum-mechanics-lithium-metal.html,New method that uses quantum mechanics can lead to improved lithium metal batteries,"In a recent study published in Nature Energy, researchers from Texas A&M University have made significant strides in understanding the effects of external pressure on lithium-metal batteries. Dr. Perla Balbuena and Dr. Jorge Seminario, professors in the Artie McFerrin Department of Chemical Engineering, utilized quantum mechanics to gain insights into the behavior of lithium ions under pressure. This research has the potential to advance the development of longer-lasting and more efficient lithium-metal battery technologies.

The impact of this study extends beyond the field of chemical engineering. Dr. Balbuena emphasizes that the methods employed in this research can be applied to various disciplines, such as chemical engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, materials science, and biology. The utilization of first-principles ab initio analysis has proven to be instrumental in designing macroscopic processes.

This research is part of the ongoing work conducted by the Battery500 Consortium, a collaboration between national labs and academia. Led by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, the consortium aims to develop more reliable and high-performing vehicle batteries in line with the Department of Energy's objectives.

Lithium-ion batteries have revolutionized the world of mobile electronics, enabling the development of compact devices that can easily fit in our pockets. These batteries are widely used in smartphones, watches, toys, laptops, electric vehicles, and power grids. However, they still face several challenges, one of which is limited energy density resulting from the battery components.

Dr. Seminario explains that lithium-ion batteries operate by converting lithium ions into neutral species, storing their energy as chemical energy, and then converting them back into ions to transport the energy as electrical energy. The anode, or negative electrode, holds the lithium ions with the maximum energy, while the cathode, or positive electrode, has the lowest energy level. This energy difference drives the migration of lithium ions from the anode to the cathode during discharge, energizing external devices through the flow of electrons.

To overcome the limitations of current lithium-ion batteries, researchers are exploring alternative materials, including lithium metal as a replacement for the conventional graphite anode. Theoretically, this substitution could significantly enhance the energy density of the anode. However, the highly reactive nature of lithium metal requires innovative control measures, such as applying external pressure to the battery.

Currently, there is limited research on the relationship between external pressure and the electroplating of lithium in large-format pouch cells to improve battery performance. Additionally, during the assembly and cycling of the battery, volume changes in its components can lead to swelling and impact battery performance and cycle life.

The research conducted at Texas A&M University focused on understanding why pressure can lead to more uniform distribution of lithium ions on the anode, preventing the formation of dendrites that could potentially short-circuit the battery. By using theoretical-computational techniques, the researchers analyzed the precise effects of pressure on lithium-metal anodes.

Dr. Balbuena explains that through quantum mechanical analysis, they were able to track the trajectories of lithium ions migrating from the cathode to the anode. The modified surface of the anode, influenced by the pressure effect, plays a crucial role in subsequent electrodepositions. The team discovered that lithium ions tend to detour towards regions with higher pressure or a higher concentration of lithium atoms on the surface. This behavior is a result of the electric field generated by the lithium-metal anode.

This significant finding allows researchers to predict the behavior of novel materials proposed for cutting-edge applications. Predicting ion behavior in these conditions can pave the way for the widespread use of lithium-metal batteries with lower fabrication costs, longer battery life, and increased functionality.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/match-board-directors-after-talks-activist-investor-elliott-management/,Match appoints two board directors after talks with activist investor Elliott Management,"Tinder-owner Match Group has recently made some significant announcements. They have appointed two new members to their board of directors and signed an agreement with Elliott Management, an activist investor. The new board members are Laura Jones, the Chief Marketing Officer at Instacart, and Spencer Rascoff, the co-founder of Zillow. According to Match, these appointments were made following a ""constructive dialogue"" with Elliott Management, and the two companies have entered into an ""information-sharing"" agreement. This news comes after it was reported a few months ago that Elliott had acquired a stake of around $1 billion in Match Group.

The report also mentioned that Elliott was interested in discussing ways for Match to improve its performance, as the company has been facing a decline in paying users due to economic uncertainty. Marc Steinberg, a partner at Elliott, expressed confidence in Match Group's potential for value creation as the global leader in online dating. He praised the collaboration with management and the board and highlighted the strong additions of Laura Jones and Spencer Rascoff to the board. Their unique skills and perspectives are expected to support the company's growth in the next phase.

Elliott Management has gained a reputation for making changes in tech companies by acquiring stakes and pushing for improvements. This push for change at Match Group follows similar board shakeups at Crown Castle and Etsy.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, Match Group experienced a 5% decline in the number of total paid users compared to the previous year, with a total of 15.2 million users. The company's growth has slowed down after reaching its peak during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a significant decline in stock value.

Match Group is the parent company of several popular dating apps, including Tinder, Hinge, Match.com, Meetic, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, and OurTime. These apps have become household names and have played a significant role in the online dating scene.

With the addition of Laura Jones and Spencer Rascoff to its board of directors, Match Group hopes to navigate the challenges it is currently facing and regain its growth momentum. The company remains committed to providing a seamless and enjoyable online dating experience for its users across its various platforms.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1241790742.jpeg?w=1024,2024-03-25 14:15:04,Innovation,Innovation

Welcome to another day of Wordle! If you're looking for hints, clues, and the answer to Monday's Wordle, you're in the right place. But before we dive into that, let's take a moment to reflect on the peculiarities of this March. Winter seems to be holding on tightly, not allowing spring to fully blossom. Although the sun is shining today and the snow is melting, we're in for more snow over the Easter weekend. And as if that's not enough, the day after Easter brings us April Fool's Day, a day that many of us would rather avoid, especially online.

Interestingly enough, it was on April Fool's Day that I managed to solve not just one, but two Wordles in a single guess. I chose the word ""march"" because if I were playing a Wordle-style prank on April Fool's, I would select the only other month with five letters that isn't just a proper noun (since ""April"" is only a proper noun and therefore cannot be a Wordle answer).

Speaking of proper nouns, yesterday's Wordle really had me puzzled!

But enough reminiscing, let's get down to today's Wordle.

How to Solve Today's Wordle

Hint: Politician
Clue: Today's Wordle ends with a consonant

Now, let's dive into the answer. But before we do, I must warn you, spoilers ahead!

*drumroll*

The Answer: [Insert answer here]

Wordle Analysis

After each round of Wordle, I eagerly check my stats using Wordle Bot. If you haven't tried it yet, you can check your Wordles with Wordle Bot too. It's a great tool!

Today, I was so sure that I had the right answer on my third guess, only to be disappointed when the third box turned gray. Oh well, c'est la vie! My initial guess was a good start, but not quite there. I had 196 words remaining and only one yellow letter, 'O'. With some strategic thinking, I managed to narrow it down to 11 words and two more yellow letters. After some careful juggling, I settled on the word ""major"" because out of all the words I could think of, two of them had the letter 'M' in them. Unfortunately, it turned out to be ""mayor"" and not ""major"" that was the correct answer for today's Wordle.

Competitive Wordle Score

Today, I lose 1 point because the Bot solved it in just three guesses (crane / tyros / mayor — tyros? Really?), and I score 0 points for guessing in four. So, overall, I'm at -1. Sigh.

Wordle Etymology

Let's take a moment to explore the etymology of the word ""mayor."" It comes from the Old French word ""maire,"" which means ""head of a city or town government."" This Old French word itself descends from the Latin word ""maior,"" meaning ""greater"" or ""superior."" In Latin, ""maior"" was used in the title ""maior domus"" or ""major domo,"" which referred to the ""chief steward"" of a noble house, indicating a position of authority and oversight. Over time, ""maior"" evolved into different forms in the Romance languages, eventually giving birth to the English word ""mayor."" The role of a mayor as the leader of a city or municipal government reflects the historical sense of being a superior or chief official within a local jurisdiction.
