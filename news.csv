They have developed a novel multifunctional additive that enhances the efficiency and stability of inverted PSCs.

Perovskite solar cells have gained attention in recent years due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties and potential for large-scale production at a low cost. However, their commercialization has been hindered by the relatively low power conversion efficiency (PCE) and poor long-term stability. These issues are primarily caused by open-circuit voltage loss and crystallographic defects in the perovskite films.

To overcome these challenges, Prof. Ge Ziyi's team introduced a new additive called potassium (4-tert-butoxycarbonylpiperazin-1-yl) methyl trifluoroborate (PTFBK) into the perovskite precursor solution. This additive effectively passivates defects and improves the extraction of carriers in the perovskite films.

The researchers discovered that the combination of PTFBK with other passivation effects enhances the crystallization ability of the perovskite, resulting in high-quality films with larger grain size. This, in turn, leads to highly efficient rigid and flexible perovskite solar cells with impressive power conversion efficiencies of 24.99% and 23.48%, respectively.

One of the notable advantages of the PTFBK-modified device is its excellent thermal, humidity, and light stability. The hydrogen bonding between formamidinium and fluorine contributes to the device's stability under various conditions, such as continuous heating at 85°C in N2-filled containers, ambient conditions at 60%–70% relative humidity, and continuous illumination at 100 mW cm-2. In fact, the flexible PSCs developed in this study retain 85% of their initial power conversion efficiency even after 5,000 bending cycles at a radius of 5 mm, demonstrating remarkable bending stability.

This groundbreaking research opens up new possibilities for the future development and commercialization of perovskite solar cells and related photovoltaic technologies.

In conclusion, Prof. Ge Ziyi's team at NIMTE has successfully improved the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells by introducing a multifunctional additive. This additive passivates defects and enhances carrier extraction in the perovskite films, leading to highly efficient and stable solar cells. The development of flexible perovskite solar cells with excellent bending stability is a significant step forward in the field. These findings pave the way for the future commercialization of perovskite solar cells and related technologies.
