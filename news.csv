In the recent monthly patch cycle in March 2024, Microsoft addressed critical issues in software like HyperV and Exchange Server. These fixes were released after the launch of the 2024 H1 Cumulative Update for Exchange Server in February. The update includes the activation of Extended Protection (EP) by default. EP is a Windows feature that protects servers from man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks. Microsoft first announced the automatic inclusion of EP in 2023. This security upgrade aims to resolve CVE-2024-21410, a privilege escalation vulnerability that leads to NTLM relay attacks on Exchange Server. It is important to note that this vulnerability is currently being actively exploited in the wild. Attackers can target an NTLM client, such as Outlook, with an NTLM credentials-leaking type vulnerability. The leaked credentials can then be relayed against the Exchange server to gain privileges and perform operations on the victim's behalf. CVE-2024-21410 was disclosed in the February 2024 Microsoft patch update.

Original article, first published in 2021: Microsoft Exchange Server is facing active exploitation by state-sponsored threat groups and others using four zero-day vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are being used to deploy backdoors and malware in widespread attacks. While these attacks are not believed to be connected to the SolarWinds supply chain attack, there is concern that organizations not patching their vulnerable servers could face similar consequences. Microsoft was made aware of the four zero-day bugs in early January 2021. A researcher named ""Orange Tsai,"" who discovered two of the security issues, reported them to the vendor on January 5, 2021. It was described as one of the most serious Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities ever reported. Attacks exploiting these vulnerabilities may have started as early as January 6, 2021. Suspicious activity on Microsoft Exchange servers was reported by Dubex in the same month. On March 2, 2021, Microsoft released patches to address the four critical vulnerabilities in Exchange Server software. The company stated that these bugs were actively being exploited in limited, targeted attacks. Microsoft Exchange Server is widely used as an email inbox, calendar, and collaboration solution by businesses of all sizes. However, over a month after the patches were released, the security issue persists due to delays in patching vulnerable servers. Microsoft is currently investigating potential links between privately shared Proof-of-Concept (PoC) attack code and the exploit tools observed in the wild. They are also looking into the possibility of an accidental or deliberate leak that may have prompted a spike in attacks. The critical vulnerabilities, collectively known as ProxyLogon, impact on-premise Exchange Server versions 2013, 2016, and 2019. Exchange Online is not affected. Microsoft is also updating Exchange Server 2010 for defense-in-depth purposes. The vulnerabilities include CVE-2021-26855, a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability that allows unauthenticated attackers to send crafted HTTP requests. Servers must be able to accept untrusted connections over port 443 for this bug to be triggered. CVE-2021-26857 is an insecure deserialization vulnerability in the Exchange Unified Messaging Service, enabling arbitrary code deployment under SYSTEM. However, this vulnerability requires combination with another exploit or the use of stolen credentials. CVE-2021-26858 is a post-authentication arbitrary file write vulnerability that allows attackers to write to specific paths. Lastly, CVE-2021-27065 is a post-authentication arbitrary file write vulnerability that also enables attackers to write to specific paths.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/d6053e8cb66c812f4b9952571dd8d8a9ada6f5d2/2024/03/26/c7a8ef59-b2ab-45eb-a718-3f1e1ce5a8d9/gettyimages-1971423759.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-26,Innovation,Innovation
