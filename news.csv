But Anas Andaloussi, at that tender age, was already making over $50,000 from his projects monthly. Such precocious success begs the question - how did a young boy from Spain manage to build an empire rooted in artificial intelligence?
The turning point for Anas came when he discovered Search Engine Optimization (SEO). By applying SEO techniques, he was able to drive traffic to his site without constantly relying on YouTube videos. A self-taught SEO expert, Anas began to reinvest his earnings into other digital projects. His Minecraft blog's popularity surged when a renowned English YouTuber joined his blog, generating big traffic to the blog.

By the time he reached his senior year of high school, Anas sold his Minecraft blog and shifted his focus to niche websites optimized for SEO. He drew inspiration from Romualds, a leading Spanish SEO expert and YouTuber, and at one point was earning close to $5,000 monthly from multiple websites.
However, the key point of his career was the creation of Escribelo.AI, a powerful artificial intelligence tool designed to create SEO-optimized content. Created to satisfy its own content needs, the tool currently generates more than $65,000 per month. And if that wasn't impressive enough, the entire Anas team is made up of people under the age of twenty.
The Future of Anas Andaloussi
Anas's starting as a passionate Minecraft player, he transformed into an entrepreneur, leveraging the power of AI and SEO. He's in the process of building a conglomerate in the AI sector, with acquisitions of related AI businesses. His latest project, QuickTok.AI, allows users to create videos from text, further cementing his position as an innovator in the AI realm.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/653e69d0d65b3a4f6bac21ca/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2023-10-29 10:25:42

Actor Matthew Perry tragically passed away on Saturday at the age of 54. The actor, obviously best known for his role as Chandler Bing on Friends, had a wide-ranging career, including one that briefly encompassed the gaming realm.
Gamers are paying tribute to Perry for his fantastic performance as Benny in Obsidian’s Fallout: New Vegas, one of the most appreciated characters in one of the most beloved games in the series.
The way this happened, apparently, is that Perry spoke publicly about his love for the Fallout series. There’s a clip of him on Ellen (at about 8:45) talking about how he played Fallout 3 so much that he injured his hand and had to get injections to treat it. He then takes out a signed copy of the game, which along with an Xbox 360, he donates to raise money for the Humane Society.
This was seen by the Fallout team, and that ended up with Perry getting the role of Benny in the next game, New Vegas, the character that is present in the famous opener, and of course throughout the rest of the game as well. Here’s a sampling of his voicework from that intro to New Vegas:
In 2017, Chris Avellone said that he wished Benny could have been implemented as a possible companion, given how good the character was.
This is in fact the only video game role that Perry ever had, sticking to TV and a number of films. Currently, Bethesda’s Fallout series is relegated to Fallout 76 updates, with Fallout 5 probably close to a decade away with Bethesda’s current scheduling, unless new owner Microsoft gives it to a different studio (and they also own Obsidian now, of course). I would expect Bethesda or Obsidian to pay tribute to Perry themselves, and perhaps down the road, there could be some sort of in-game reference to his iconic performance as Benny.
It's terribly sad what happened to Perry after so many great roles but a long and difficult life in which he struggled with addiction. His role as Benny will remain an important part of one of the best series in gaming, and it’s great to know what a huge fan he was, and how that ended up landing him the role in the first place. If you have New Vegas in your collection, maybe go say hi.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2023/10/29/renewable-costs-have-risen-policymakers-can-help-reverse-the-inflationary-blip/,Policymakers Can Reverse Inflation Blip,"Inflation has hit the entire energy sector, and renewable energy is no exception. For decades developers fought to become competitive—then dominant––as the source of new power sector generation, and it’s worked for the most part.
While renewable energy costs fell fast over the past decade, those declines recently leveled off, and in some cases, reversed. But this temporary development doesn’t mean we should abandon clean energy or fossil fuel plant retirements.
To understand what’s driving renewable energy price changes, my colleagues and I interviewed energy market experts and reviewed publicly available cost data.
Our research shows the main factors driving renewable energy cost increases tend to be temporary, and costs are still competitive with fossil fuels, which suffered volatile price swings and drastic cost increases in 2022. While some localized projects have experienced high cost increases, the data shows average impacts have been modest.

Company engineers estimate Kohl's will be able to reduce their electricity usage on average by 25% once power begins flowing from the 1980 rooftop panels. Kohl's signed a contract with SunEdison, based in Beltsville, Maryland, to receive electricity for 20 years at a reduced price from public utility rates. New Jersey is the nation's second largest producer of solar energy behind California. State and federal tax incentives help individuals and commercial enterprises cover the costs of solar panel installations. SunEdison is North America's largest solar energy service provider.

Even with modest increases, wind, solar, and battery storage projects still provide ample market value. And the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) tax incentives will underpin long-term deployment and cost declines of these technologies that are core to cutting climate pollution.
Still, these cost increases expose flaws in how we plan the grid and regulate utilities. By taking a proactive approach to cost drivers like grid connection, labor force, and domestic supply chains, energy regulators and state energy officials can reduce developer risk and keep cutting costs as the market rebounds from inflation.
The state of renewable energy costs
Lawrence Berkeley National Lab’s (LBNL) 2023 Utility Scale Solar and Wind Market reports show flattening and mildly rising clean energy costs are consistent across multiple datasets. LBNL analyzed utility-scale wind and solar contract prices, finding that from 2020-2022 they remained stable and competitive with gas.
Figure 52: Levelized wind and solar PPA prices and levelized gas price projections Berkeley Lab, FERC, EIA
Other data from Level Ten, which measures corporate renewable energy purchases, found similar trends with data up to 2023. Price increases have been higher in the corporate power purchase agreements than in the utility procurements collected by LBNL, reflecting economies of scale and greater offtake certainty associated with utility buyers. Even with these price increases, LBNL found most regions are profitable markets for new wind and solar projects.
LBNL also found coupling battery storage with solar projects only added modest additional costs – about 30-50% depending on project size. Batteries add reliability value while keeping projects competitive with other reliability resources like gas plants, and they can function on their own as power plants and grid infrastructure.
In late 2022, Bloomberg New Energy Finance observed battery pack prices slightly increased from $141 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) to $151/kWh, the first year-over-year price increase since Bloomberg began reporting data. However, lithium and other raw material prices fell precipitously in 2023, and the IRA has kick-started $70 billion worth of investments in a burgeoning competitive domestic battery manufacturing industry.
Investment announcements made prior to IRA being signed into law are not included on this map. ... [+] Additionally, semiconductor manufacturing investments are not included, as most of their incentives are drawn from The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. Jack Conness
What’s driving cost increases, and where they are headed
Price increases come from a range of factors including trade policies, volatile commodities, supply chain snags, high interest rates, rising labor costs, and an inadequate grid.
The Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duties (AD/CVD) and Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA), including the uncertain guidance surrounding these policies, have created supply shortages for solar and battery components as foreign manufacturers struggle to get their products into the U.S. Meanwhile, critical components for clean energy like semiconductors, steel, and copper have seen significant supply crunch and price increases over the past year. IRA policies will expand the nation’s domestic manufacturing industry, but it will take a few more years before a robust onshore supply chain materializes.
Like the rest of the economy, clean energy industries are also contending with rising labor costs. Prevailing wage requirements are a condition to receive full IRA tax incentives, but labor-related costs and challenges have less to do with paying prevailing wages, and more to do with compliance documentation and bottlenecks for hiring qualified workers. Developing qualified labor is one area where federal and state policymakers can help alleviate near-term cost increases.
High interest rates are another key cost driver. While rates are high today and disproportionately increase the cost of capital-intensive renewables projects relative to fuel-based resources like natural gas generators, interest rates are inherently volatile and unpredictable. Morningstar predicts interest rates will fall from an average of 5% (real) in 2023 to 2% in 2026 – this would cut the cost of a typical utility-scale solar project 20%.
Renewable energy project developers now face considerably more risk due to rising interconnection costs and timelines. It now takes four to five years on average to move through the interconnection study process to completion – a doubling over the last decade. When average interconnection times increase, developers face increased cost of capital and overall risk to projects. Recent FERC action and grid operator attention to this issue has renewed interest on fixing outdated rules, but incumbent power in these markets and technical complexity make it difficult to change quickly.
What’s the future of renewable energy costs?
Recent cost increases make it more important than ever that policymakers keep supporting renewable energy and mitigating the barriers driving these increases. Slowing down on renewable energy could squander public health gains, reliability, consumer savings, and job creation. As uneconomic coal plants retire, adding wind, solar, and storage can avoid future capacity shortfalls.
While the market rights itself and cost pressures ease, several policy improvements can ensure we secure these benefits and insulate renewable deployment from future volatility.
First, utility regulators must enhance real-time feedback between market conditions and utility power plant contracts. Utilities seeking to protect their investments in existing fossil fuels may not regularly test the assumption these plants remain economic, risking an overcorrection of outdated estimates lasting several years. Regulators must ensure utility cost estimates track coming cost declines accurately to protecting consumers and overcome bias towards preserving the status quo.
Next, utilities and regional transmission operators must update interconnection and transmission planning rules to reduce grid connection risks and costs for clean energy projects. Grid regions like PJM and ISO-New England struggling with planning the grid for rapid interconnection can learn from Texas. While PJM delayed review of new interconnection applications until 2026, Texas has added solar and wind faster than any region, and times from interconnection application to agreement range from one to two years.

Building more lines is not the only way to increase transmission capacity - grid enhancing technologies (GETs) and advanced conductors are also cheaper and faster ways to upgrade the grid using existing lines. For instance, GETs can potentially enable renewable energy capacity to double, and advanced conductors could double the capacity of existing lines without needing major new permits. However, utility incentives can be misaligned with their consideration and use. To capitalize on existing rights of way, regulators should require utilities and transmission service providers consider GETs and advanced conductors in their planning processes.
Finally, states should focus their attention on attracting investment in domestic clean energy supply chains. The IRA incentivizes onshoring clean energy manufacturing, which should increase component supplies, reduce the impact of tariffs and create jobs across the country. Governors and state economic development offices have particular power to attract manufacturing to their state and should take this opportunity to identify what industries might be a best fit. In Georgia, for example, Governor Kemp committed to making the state a leader in electric mobility manufacturing – and $15 billion in new investment has followed since IRA passage.
Long-term, economies of scale should continue to reduce average wind, solar, and battery costs and sustained IRA support will create opportunities throughout the country to save consumers money. Policymakers concerned about cost increases should use all tools in their toolbox to integrate the changing dynamics of clean energy into decision-making while reducing the cost and risks for clean energy projects.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/63058b2949f98d56cf2f6909/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2023-10-29 10:15:00
https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2023/10/29/heres-who-markiplier-was-supposed-to-play-in-five-nights-at-freddys/,Here’s Who Markiplier Was Supposed To Play In ‘Five Nights At Freddy’s’,"Markiplier YouTube
Five Nights At Freddy’s is currently in the midst of an absolutely monster box office weekend, well beyond anyone’s wildest expectations thanks to the strength of the IP and the fact that it appears to be serving fans, though not critics, very well.
It’s actually hard to think of a movie made more directly for fans and not critics, and that includes not just references to the game, but references to the IRL world and lore surrounding the game. Namely, creators who have a certain attachment to the game. We saw Coryxkenshin as an Uber driver (this was in the trailer), and we knew that MatPat would cameo in the film as well, though the exact nature of the cameo was indeed kept under wraps, and was often wrongly reported, before the film. But it’s a part I’m told is getting “Captain America wields Thor’s hammer” reactions in the movie theater.
However, one big Five Nights at Freddy’s icon missed the cut, though not on purpose. That would be beloved YouTuber Markiplier, who has an extremely long history with the series and was indeed supposed to have a cameo in the film, but simply could not do it with scheduling conflicts, as he’s busy doing his own movie, Iron Lung.
Five Nights at Freddy's Universal
But we know, thanks to MatPat, what Markiplier’s role was supposed to be in Five Nights at Freddy’s, were he available. He would have been front and center playing the first security guard in the film’s opening, one hunted down and fed into a woodchipper mask by the demented animatronics. That role was instead played by actor Ryan Reinike, who is not involved in any sort of inside joke casting.
So Markiplier missed out, but FNAF is such an absolutely massive success that a sequel is going to be instantly greenlit, if not a trilogy or more, and that means more movies with more potential space for cameos. Hell, just let him star in the thing, you’d probably double the box office from that alone. But while that probably won’t happen, I would absolutely expect to see him in the next one, even if it’s just a brief part like MatPat’s, which still lit up audiences despite just being a handful of lines.
The question now is what the final opening weekend tally will be, which may set a Blumhouse record, and what it’s global haul will end up being. The movie is about to quadruple its budget in its opening weekend, and is well on its way to being one of the biggest success movie success stories in 2023. Don’t underestimate the youths.

China’s electric vehicles (EV) are getting cheaper, while the reverse is happening in Europe and the U.S., according to a report from auto industry consultants JATO Dynamics.
This will come as no surprise to shareholders in Ford, General Motors, Mercedes and Volkswagen, who have seen stock prices hit after ambitious sales targets for EVs stumbled.
Europeans will be more worried than American buyers because the Biden administration insists EV buyers can only claim a $7,500 tax credit if batteries contain certain components made in North America and critical minerals sourced in the U.S.
There is no such limitation in Europe, although the E.U is investigating whether China’s sales of electric cars might require anti-dumping action.
JATO Dynamics said Chinese EV-makers continue to accelerate ahead of their Western counterparts in their ability to make competitively priced vehicles.
“The price gap has widened, with the average retail price of an electric car available in China now less than half the price seen in both Europe and the USA. In the first half of 2023, and electric car cost €31,165 ($33,000) in China, €66,864 ($70,700) in Europe, and €68,023 ($72,000) in the U.S.,” JATO said.
“Despite efforts by Western (manufacturers) to produce more affordable EVs, these models continue to cost more than their gasoline and diesel equivalents. Today, consumers would need to spend €18,285 ($19,500) and €24,400 ($25,800) to buy an EV in Europe and the U.S., respectively – this is 92% and 146% more than they would need to pay for the cheapest combustion car available. In comparison, in China the cheapest electric vehicle costs 8% less than the cheapest ICE (internal combustion engine) equivalent,” JATO said.
“China’s EVs are not only competing on price but also in terms of quality and power. Today, China can produce and sell an electric car with 200-300 hp for an average of €30,500/$33,150,” the report said.

It cited the BYD Seal – a midsize sedan – with 204 hp in Elite trim in China for just €24,106/$26,197. In Europe, the closest rival in price is a little Renault Twingo Equilibre - a city-car produced in Slovenia – priced at €24,320/$26,430 with just 81 hp.

Meanwhile Western wannabe competitors are conceding defeat and going back to the drawing board.
Last week, Ford Motor’s stock price dived after it reported big losses from its EV business, citing pressure from a price war sparked by Tesla. Ford also cut production of its Mustang Mach-E and scaled back its £12 billion EV investment plan.
Ford’s EV division more than doubled losses to $1.3 billion in the 3rd quarter, compared with the same period last year.
GM cut its profit forecast earlier in the week and said it was abandoning its target to build 100,000 EVs in the 2nd half of this year and another 400,000 in the 1st half of 2024 but didn’t say when these targets would be restored.

The Wall Street Journal said GM was rethinking its EV project.
“It (GM) scrapped EV production targets and said it was slowing its growth plans. It wants time to incorporate engineering changes that should boost the profitability of its production platform,” Heard on the Street columnist Stephen Wilmot said.
“A slower rollout of EVs might strengthen the company’s profit next year, but it weakens GM’s position as an auto-industry leader,” Wilmot said.
Mercedes conceded having to slash prices to move its EVs and said the consumer adoption rate was lower than expected. Volkswagen has had to cut production of EVs below its earlier expectations.
Investment bank UBS pointed to the growing financial risks to EV programs as demand plateaus, saying the relative affordability of EVs has worsened as ICE discounts increased.
JATO Dynamics said in the report intense price competition in China had forced its EV makers to become more efficient to survive, while the Chinese government provided “robust” support, with subsidies totalling $57 billion between 2016 and 2022. Tax breaks had supported sales, while most EVs were exempt from sales tax. China’s low labor costs helped too. The average European hourly wage rate is just under 10 times the Chinese one.
Felipe Munoz, Global Analyst at JATO Dynamics, said European and U.S. manufacturers need to intensify R&D and cut costs to improve affordability.
“As China becomes an increasingly influential player on the global automotive stage, its brands are becoming more visible in countries where, just a few years ago, consumers would not have considered them a viable alternative.”
“This is a trend that has been driven by the relative affordability of its models in comparison to those produced by its Western peers, and while the U.S. and the EU have responded to the challenge posed by China through major policy decisions, policy alone will not be enough to address the issue of affordability.”
“Western (manufacturers) must shift their focus towards the research and development of new technologies and production processes designed specifically for a fully electrified future,” Munoz said in the report.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/653d373e455b3908f5443126/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2023-10-29 09:46:15
https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2023/10/29/the-finals-is-using-ai-voicework-and-it-is-bad/,'The Finals' Is Using AI Voicework And It Is Bad,"The Finals Embark
I really have enjoyed The Finals, an innovative FPS currently in open testing, using unique verticality and heavily destructible environments to its advantage. At least it’s fun when the servers are working.
But as I wrote about it, kept hearing people chime in “but have you heard about the AI?” Uh oh.
No, this is not referring to enemy AI, rather generative AI, the technology transforming and/or ruining a bunch of industries right now, and video games are not immune. As it turns out, developer Embark Studios is using AI for essentially all the voicework in The Finals. And they are not making it a big secret, as you can hear them talking about the use in a podcast.
They say that the technology is “far enough in terms of quality,” that it saves them supposed months of voicework to be able to record lines for new additions to the game within hours (and of course, they save money not paying actual voice actors). They also say that if there’s any sort of glitchiness or weirdness to it, well that plays into their weird game show world they’ve made.
But it’s…bad. Once you know it’s AI you really cannot un-hear it. You can listen to the announcers in the game and they just don’t sound right. The cadence is off. There’s weird breathing sometimes. It’s just not good compared to the quality of the actual gameplay. And that’s a shame, because the shoutcasting gameshow idea is actually a good one, but they couldn’t hire two actors to record actual lines for this? It’s not like some sort of 3,000 page Baldur’s Gate script. This is just corner-cutting, plain and simple, and the game will suffer for it.
How much will it suffer, though?
The thing with AI is that we might mock the “good enough” nature of it, but the majority of the public is probably not going to notice this in any meaningful capacity. Nor will the “this game uses AI? I’m not playing” crowd be terribly large. This is not good mind you, as it contributes to the normalization of this tech in places like this, but it does seem like the game would pay a small price for this, if any.
Currently, video game voice actors are pushing back heavily on the concept of people or companies using their voices in apps like Respeecher to make them perform lines they never recorded. But the opposite, using programs to replace voice actors from the start is different, and in many ways worse. And right now it’s hard to see protections against that any time soon, short of players, en masse, refusing to buy or play games that use AI like this. I mean, maybe that can happen, but in a case like this, I doubt it’s enough to make a difference.
I hope that The Finals will indeed take feedback and use actual actors to record actual lines for the otherwise great game, but we’ll have to see.

Layzner will finally come Westward on Blu-ray this December, and fans of Armored Core VI will want to pick this up.
As I have previously covered, the mecha anime of Ryosuke Takahashi has had a massive influence on the Armored Core series over the years.
This isn’t some kind of fan conjecture either, as FromSoftware have openly acknowledged the influence of Takahashi’s works on Armored Core on multiple occasions.
In more recent years, Blue Comet SPT Layzner has had a specific influence, not only on Armored Core 4 and Armored Core For Answer but also the recently released Armored Core VI.
Things like the quick boosting and spherical energy shields, not to mention the overt potency of the mecha themselves all made obvious references to Layzner. Not to mention the story elements of augmented humans and rogue AI being tied back to those mecha anime as well.
Even the much loved Rusty is in many ways a reference to the main character of Eiji, trying to end the conflict on behalf of the Rubiconians. Steel Haze is also a blue colored and highly mobile Armored Core that gets a “mid-season” upgrade. So yeah, there are very obvious nods to Layzner in Armored Core VI.
This particular Blu-ray release of Layzner is also of the remastered Japanese version from a while back. I had hoped someone would pick it up, and it seems that Discotek have managed to snag this one.
One other nice thing to mention is that Crunchyroll is releasing this Blu-ray of Layzner on December 26. That happens to the same day as Kunio Okawara’s birthday, with Okawara being responsible for the mecha design in Layzner and many other Takahashi mecha anime.
Anyway, you can pick up this Blu-ray set of Layzner via Crunchyroll’s online store for an insanely reasonable $52.46, which is a mere fraction of the cost of the Japanese Blu-ray boxset. It will also come with the entire TV series and the OVAs, which finish the story, as the TV series was cut short on its original run.

Have you ever seen someone on a live stream or broadcasting from home who seems to have a superbly clear video feed? Your first thoughts may be that they have a top-of-the-range webcam, but they may also have a proper lighting setup.
Webcams need a decent amount of light to produce good-quality images and if a scene is too dark, the images will soon look fuzzy and grainy. So, before you ditch your webcam for a more expensive model, check whether your lighting is adequate, especially if you want to look your best during a Zoom call or when livestreaming.
All sorts of lights are available from various manufacturers, but many are unlabeled products from China and may not guarantee optimum performance. Choosing a well-known brand is one way to ensure you get a high-quality light. Companies with an excellent reputation to protect seldom market sub-standard products.
A ring light is probably the best source for live streaming or Zoom calls. I’ve tried quite a few over the year, but they can vary significantly in quality. Ring lights are a perfect illumination source because they produce an all-round soft lighting effect that’s incredibly flattering. A good ring light can take years off your face.

The Joby Beamo has 10 brightness levels and can be powered using a USB 5V/2A source. There’s a choice of color temperature settings ranging from 3,000K through to 5,600K. The brightness and color temperature settings can be changed using an inline switch on the power cable, which offers instant changes so you can see which settings work best. The Beamo weighs just 330g so it can also be mounted on a microphone boom arm.
Along with the Beamo Ring Light, this kit comes with what I think is one of the best compact tripods on the market. The Joby RangePod Smart is a professional tripod with a sturdy aluminum construction. It also ships with a ball head, quick-release plate and Joby’s smartphone clamp for mounting a phone in landscape or portrait orientation.

It’s not been the smoothest start for Cities: Skylines II, with the game plagued by poor performance. But if you’re desperate to start building a city from scratch and haven’t got a PC capable of running the game smoothly, there is a solution.
Cities: Skylines II is available on Nvidia GeForce Now, the graphics firm’s games streaming service. Whether you’ve bought the game on Steam or you’ve got access to it as part of a Microsoft Game Pass subscription, you can take advantage of the cloud service’s high-performance graphics to run the game smoothly. Read on to find out how well GeForce Now copes with the game.
Cities: Skylines II Performance Woes
Even ahead of Cities: Skylines II’s release on Tuesday, things looked ominous.
“Cities: Skylines 2 is a next-gen title, and naturally, it demands certain hardware requirements,” developer Colossal Order said in a statement released earlier this month. “With that said, while our team has worked tirelessly to deliver the best experience possible, we have not achieved the benchmark we targeted.”
The company delayed the release of the console versions until 2024, but said it would press ahead with the launch of the PC version and attempt to remedy the performance problems with patches, the first of which was released on Thursday, just two days after the game was released.
However, even that patch has failed to quell the barrage of negative player reviews complaining about glitchy gameplay. “The latest 1.0.11 patch did enable ~80fps [frames per second] in the main menu, but in game it's still around 20-30fps,” said one player on Steam. “Worse still, the game now is stuttering very bad [sic] when I pan the camera, which didn't happen with the original release. This made the game literally unplayable for me post-update”.
Others have similar complaints. “I bought this after the recent performance update as my PC is only ‘decent’ and not top-of-the-range and still, with most settings disabled or on the lowest possible, the game runs so poorly,” writes another Steam reviewer.
Microsoft’s Game Pass reviews are littered with similar complaints.
Cities: Skylines II on GeForce Now
Cities: Skylines II runs smoothly on GeForce Now Ultimate Barry Collins
The good news for GeForce Now subscribers is that the cloud service largely eliminates the performance glitches and lets you play the city-building game with minimal disruption.
I tested using the GeForce Now Ultimate tier, which uses RTX 4080 graphics and supports 4K screen resolution.
In my tests, City: Skylines II ran at between 40-50fps at 4K, with the global graphics set to “high” quality, which means you don’t sacrifice any shiny effects such as realistic-looking water. The camera pans smoothly, and there’s only the occasional stutter as you zoom in to look at a particular building, for example.
Granted, I’m currently only working with a small starter city and Cities: Skyline performance does tend to suffer as your city builds into a giant metropolis, so I’ll update this post if performance begins to dip to unacceptable levels as my city develops. But given that many players have complained that the game is unplayable right from the start, it seems GeForce Now gives fans a way to play the game.
That said, it’s not cheap. The Ultimate tier of GeForce Now costs $20 per month, excluding the cost of the game itself.
The Priority tier costs half as much, because it relies on last-generation graphics. My hunch is that would still be fine, because resolutions are limited to Full HD (1o80p), but I’ve not been able to test on the Priority tier.
Improve Cities: Skylines II PC Performance
If you don’t want to invest in a cloud streaming service, Colossal Order has suggested several ways you can make Cities: Skylines II run more smoothly on your current PC hardware.
It recommends reducing screen resolution to 1080p (if you’re playing on a 4K screen in the first place), disabling depth of field and volumetrics in the graphics settings, as well as reducing global illumination.
The other alternative is to bide your time, let the hungry early adopters help the developers iron out the performance problems and wait a couple of months for the game to be better optimized. Or wait for the console release, although I find the game much better suited to mouse/keyboard controls than controllers.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/653e23478da6dc39daba6c1a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2023-10-29 05:46:03

Konami
There are some weird takes on the new Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1 and that somehow Konami hasn’t done right by these games. That’s just plain wrong.
The main complaint seems to be that the HD remasters of Metal Gear Solid 2 and Metal Gear Solid 3 don’t support high enough resolutions on PC. Furthermore, when you mod the games to force higher resolutions, things start to break.
The HD remasters were originally done by Bluepoint, who really know their stuff when it comes to remaking classic games. Especially those that were released on the PlayStation 2.
The latter is a key point, as the PlayStation 2 era of Metal Gear Solid used all manner of artistic trickery to get more out of the hardware. However, these graphical workarounds weren’t intended to be scaled up at a later date.
That means instead of changing a great deal of the backend to get something similar but probably not as good, these HD ports capped the resolution to retain most of the graphical gimmicks.
So keeping these games intact is actually the right approach here, otherwise trying to make strange and pretty bespoke hacks to work on modern PCs would likely break more than it fixed.
This is often a trade off in development and Bluepoint made the right call to keep these games as close to how they were intended.
Finally, one additional gripe is that these games don’t work well with mouse and keyboard. That may be true, but again they were never meant to be played on a mouse and keyboard.
There are plenty of excellent PC pads available, with the recent wireless 8BitDo effort coming highly recommended at only $69.99.
Protecting our collective gaming history is crucially important, but that also means that some games need to remain a certain way even on modern hardware.
Inconvenient as that may be, that’s how these games will work best. Personally, I am just glad we have Metal Gear Solid: Integral finally released outside of Japan, but that may just be me.
Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1 is now available for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, PC and Switch.

https://techxplore.com/news/2023-10-cold-nordics-debunk-myth.html,Heat pumps can't take the cold? Nordics debunk the myth,"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:
Norway is among the countries with the most heat pumps per capita.
By installing a heat pump in his house in the hills of Oslo, Oyvind Solstad killed three birds with one stone, improving his comfort, finances and climate footprint.
""When I researched this, I read that a heat pump can generate the heat equivalent of three to four times the amount of electricity you put into it,"" said the 56-year-old communications adviser for a railway company.
""So just that fact made a light bulb go off above my head, thinking 'This has to be clever'.""
Hundreds of thousands of Norwegians have had the same bright idea, including Crown Prince Haakon who has had heat pumps installed at his official residence.
Norway is among the countries with the most heat pumps per capita, along with neighboring Finland and Sweden.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) considers the technology as instrumental in combating climate change as electric vehicles, since heating solutions generate some four billion metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, representing eight percent of global emissions.
The fact that Nordic countries, known for their harsh winters, are among the biggest users disproves the often-held assumption that the technology does not work when the temperature plummets.
The myth has fueled resistance across continental Europe.
""There are a lot of false myths out there about heat pumps. Some oil and gas producing countries such as Russia, some people, some sectors, some businesses don't want to see this transition,"" explained Caroline Haglund Stignor, a researcher at RISE Research Institutes of Sweden.
""Yes, heat pumps work in cold climates. Yes, heat pumps work in old buildings.""
Oyvind Solstad, who has installed a heat pump at home.
To heat a home, heat pumps extract outdoor heat—which exists even in cold weather—and inject it indoors.
Early models did not include defrosting systems or variable speed compressors, which nowadays enable them to run more efficiently in a wider range of temperatures.
While their efficiency declines somewhat in cold weather, they are still more efficient and greener than other options, experts say.
""This is a mature technology that works, proven to keep millions of homes warm every winter. But it's a continuous development to make it even better,"" Stignor said.
According to a study by the independent group Regulatory Assistance Project (RAP), air source cold-climate heat pumps can be up to twice as efficient as electric heating when outdoor temperatures fall to -30 Celsius (-22 Fahrenheit).
In France, heat pump detractors also argue they lead to higher electricity consumption, don't work well in all conditions, such as poorly insulated homes, and require costly installation.
Oil and gas furnaces remain popular in many countries.
In Germany, coalition partners this year finally reached an agreement to ban fossil-based heating as of 2045.
The state now subsidizes heat pumps, which in 2022 were used in just three percent of homes, and sales are beginning to take off.
Nordic countries, known for their harsh winters, are among the biggest users.
Savings
Contrary to many European countries, Norway has almost no district heating, and banned oil furnaces in January 2020.
To keep warm during its cold winters, the country relies primarily on its abundant and clean electricity, thanks to its vast hydropower resources.
By producing about three to five kWh of thermal energy for every kWh of electricity consumed, heat pumps are instruments for energy efficiency—a key aspect of the fight against climate change—and also allow consumers to make major savings.
After replacing his electric radiator with an air-to-air heat pump two years ago, Solstad saw his electricity bills shrink.
""In the first four months, our consumption decreased by 20 percent compared to the previous year even though we bought an electric car in the meantime,"" he said.
While his initial investment may seem costly, at around 2,500 euros ($2,630) including installation, he thinks it will pay for itself ""in just a few years"".
As an added bonus, his heat pump works as an air conditioner in summer.
When electricity prices went through the roof last year during the energy crisis brought on by the war in Ukraine, sales of heat pumps hit a record high in Norway, jumping by 25 percent.
The trend continued in the first half of this year.
""Norwegians have understood that they can expect higher electricity prices in the coming years compared to the past,"" explained Rolf Iver Mytting Hagemoen, head of the Norwegian Heat Pump Association (NOVAP).
""And energy efficiency is an increasingly hot issue,"" he said.

Cruising no more: The California Department of Motor Vehicles on Tuesday suspended Cruise’s deployment and driverless testing permits, ending the GM self-driving car subsidiary’s robotaxi operations in San Francisco. Subsequently, Cruise announced that it would pause all of its robotaxi operations, including in Austin, Houston, Phoenix and Miami, to “rebuild public trust.”
Expensing meets VR: Intrepid TC editor Darrell Etherington did his expensing in Concur using Meta’s latest headset, the Quest 3. So how’d it go? Concur “still sucks super hard in VR,” Darrell writes — but surprisingly, Concur didn’t suck any more than it does in more conventional computing environments, and he actually enjoyed doing most of the related, “normal computer” things on Quest 3.
Double tap that: With this week’s watchOS 10.1 drop, Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 owners now have access to one of the smartwatches’ more exciting features. Double Tap, which adds gesture-based interactions through tapping one’s index finger and thumb together twice, is a clever new way to interact with the wearable when your other hand is full, Brian writes.
Retail your way: Mary Ann writes about I Own My Data (IOMD), a startup founded by an ex-PayPal exec aiming to eliminate a tedious step for customers: creating an account every time you purchase something from an online store. With IOMD, all of a user’s private information, such as past purchases, cards, addresses and preferences, are stored on their own device — so transactions can be completed instantly with a click, tap or touch anywhere on the web.
Okta hack fallout: Network and security giant Cloudflare and password manager maker 1Password said hackers briefly targeted their systems following a recent breach of Okta’s support unit. Both Cloudflare and 1Password said their intrusions were linked to the hack of Okta, the identity and access management platform, but that the incidents didn’t affect customer systems or user data.
Carta fights back: In an attempt at damage control, Henry Ward, the CEO of the equity management startup Carta, this week emailed customers, telling them that if they’re concerned about “negative press” tied to the outfit, they should read a recent Medium post of his. In the post, Ward outlines conversations he’s had with Carta employees about numerous stories surrounding the company, including stories about lawsuits around allegations of sexual abuse on the part of executives, a toxic “boy’s club culture” and indecent exposure, among other things.
FTX execs likely escape jail: Gary Wang, co-founder and CTO of failed crypto exchange FTX; Caroline Ellison, CEO of Alameda, FTX’s sister company; and Nishad Singh, FTX head of engineering, have all pleaded guilty to charges after the exchange and Alameda’s dramatic downfall in November 2022. But an ex-Southern District of New York (SDNY) prosecutor, speaking to TechCrunch’s blockchain reporter Jacquelyn Melinek, says that Ellison, Wang and Singh probably won’t get jail time, as they’ve been cooperating witnesses.
Rivian comes out ahead: In a win for Rivian, the Amazon-backed startup’s R1T is the first EV to win the longest off-road competition in the U.S., the Rebelle Rally. The race — now in its eighth year — requires teams to complete a 2,120-kilometer course using only paper maps, compasses and plotters, Kirsten writes.

Its target, a massive cloud of dust and gas known as the Cygnus Loop or the Veil Nebula, was created after the explosive death of a star an estimated 20,000 years ago — and it’s still expanding.
NASA plans to launch the mission at 11:35 PM ET on Sunday October 29 from the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. The Integral Field Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Experiment, or INFUSE, will observe the Cygnus Loop for only a few minutes, capturing light in the far-ultraviolet wavelengths to illuminate gasses as hot as 90,000-540,000 degrees Fahrenheit. It’s expected to fly to an altitude of about 150 miles before parachuting back to Earth.
The Cygnus Loop sits about 2,600 light-years away, and was formed by the collapse of a star thought to be 20 times the size of our sun. Since the aftermath of the event is still playing out, with the cloud currently expanding at a rate of 930,000 miles per hour, it’s a good candidate for studying how supernovae affect the formation of new star systems. “Supernovae like the one that created the Cygnus Loop have a huge impact on how galaxies form,” said Brian Fleming, principal investigator for the INFUSE mission.
“INFUSE will observe how the supernova dumps energy into the Milky Way by catching light given off just as the blast wave crashes into pockets of cold gas floating around the galaxy,” Fleming said. Once INFUSE is back on the ground and its data has been collected, the team plans to fix it up and eventually launch it again.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/nMChpq383h8fywdhtr0Fkg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04NDA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-10/5bd520e0-75c7-11ee-bffe-eaae6fa67d90,2023-10-28 19:30:09
https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/us-air-force-to-test-alia-electric-aircraft-to-better-gauge-viability,Electric aircraft lands at Florida to begin Air Force tests,"Vermont-based electric aircraft startup Beta Technologies delivered its ALIA aircraft to Eglin Air Force Base in Florida on Thursday this week. This deployment marks a significant milestone, with ALIA becoming the first crewed electric aircraft delivered to the U.S. Air Force.  The aircraft has generated considerable excitement within the aviation industry with its capability to fly 336 nautical miles on a single charge, a carrying capacity of 1,250 lbs, and a cruise speed of approximately 100 knots.  Depending on the configuration, ALIA can accommodate six individuals, including the pilot, and offers the flexibility to function as either an electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) or a conventional take-off and landing (eCTOL) aircraft. “The involvement of the military massively augments our velocity on the commercial side because the military’s expectation of an airplane is fundamentally the same as the FAA’s,” Beta Technologies’ founder and CEO, Kyle Clark, told Breaking Defense in an interview ahead of ALIA’s arrival. “They want a safe, reliable, repeatedly produced aircraft."" ALIA’s deployment at Eglin Air Force Base signifies the Air Force's commitment to reducing carbon emissions, offering the agency an opportunity to conduct comprehensive tests on battery storage procedures, maintenance, and the practicality of using electric aircraft for various missions.  Beta Technologies worked closely with the U.S. Air Force, with ALIA being a part of the latter's Agility Prime program, administered by AFWERX. “For the past several years, AFWERX has provided critical input and support to the BETA programs. Deploying ALIA for experimentation and training at Duke Field is the natural next step in our partnership,” Clark highlighted. “In addition to the milestone of delivering an asset to our partners, this mission has been an invaluable opportunity to fly our electric aircraft down the east coast into the communities this technology, and our operators, will ultimately serve.” Notably, Joby Aviation, another electric aircraft startup, recently delivered its aircraft to the Air Force as part of the Agility Prime initiative. Beta Technologies While Air Force pilots have previously flown ALIA, this deployment will differ slightly, with Beta taking ownership and operation of the aircraft at Duke Field. However, the prospect of Air Force pilots flying ALIA remains open for future exploration. One unique aspect of Beta's approach is the development of a high-voltage charging station, crucial to supporting aircraft flying over long distances. The company is also working on creating a nationwide network of compatible charging stations for various electric aircraft. “The hidden gem of electrification is a gross reduction in maintenance and a gross increase in up-time,” Clark added. The CEO also believes that it made more sense to recharge the battery already in rather than swapping it out, as charging would be completed in the time taken by a battery swap and the flight debriefs. ALIA’s journey from Vermont to Florida presented an opportunity for the public to witness the potential of electric aircraft. The 2,000-mile mission included multiple stops in different states, allowing several pilots to experience its responsiveness and precision. Beta Technologies isn’t alone in the race to electrify the aviation industry. Competitors like Joby Aviation, Wisk (a subsidiary of Boeing), and Archer are also making strides, providing eco-friendly and efficient solutions for various sectors, from cargo transport to logistics and passenger flights. Beta Technologies anticipates the eCTOL version of its ALIA model to enter service in 2025, followed by the eVTOL version in 2026.

https://interestingengineering.com/military/iron-dome-us-boosts-israels-defence-system-with-tamir-missiles,US’s key military support to Israel,"The US is providing Israel with a range of weapons and military equipment to help it counter the  Hamas militant group. The conflict, which has resulted in the loss of thousands of lives on both sides, does not seem to stop anytime soon. As Israeli troops push deeper into Gaza, their warplanes hit hundreds of Hamas sites on Sunday, the Israeli army said. This is the second stage of a war that has lasted three weeks, according to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. UN chief António Guterres urged an urgent truce to help aid delivery.During talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on October 10, President Joe Biden pledged to send additional military aid to Israel, including ammunition and interceptors, to replenish the ""Iron Dome"" defense system. Biden also expressed support for Israel and promised to stand by the country during the ongoing conflict with Gaza.Tamir missiles, made by US-based RTX (formerly Raytheon) and Israeli firm Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, were among the first items to be sent to Israel after the October 7 attack. The US military uses similar weapons called SkyHunter missiles.According to News Week, the missiles are used by the mobile Iron Dome system to intercept and destroy incoming air attacks detected by radar. Each Tamir interceptor costs around $40,000, as per Foreign Policy. Iron Dome has a success rate of about 90 percent.The US aid for the Iron Dome system also includes JDAM kits, which are used to upgrade navigation systems on ""dumb bombs"" and make them precision-guided weapons, or ""smart bombs.""The first shipment of weapons also had about 1,000 small-diameter intelligent bombs. The bombs weigh around 250 pounds each and are guided by a GPS navigation system, as per The New York Times.Last week, reports said that the US would be sending Israel tens of thousands of artillery shells that were meant for Ukraine. Department of Defense officials said that the 155mm shells were originally part of a stockpile for Israel but were moved to Europe before the Middle East conflict.The exact amount of all weapons sent to Israel this month is not precise. Part of the effort to help Israel includes speeding up shipments of weapons and equipment that Israel has already bought from the US.The US has also sent Navy warships and aircraft carriers to the region, along with thousands of troops and Air Force fighter jets. The buildup is meant to help Israel with planning and intelligence operations rather than directly interfering in the conflict.Biden asked Congress for $100 billion in extra funding to help Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan, and security along the US-Mexico border last week. While some have opposed bundling the aid, most of Congress is in favor of sending more aid to Israel.However, a few Republicans who strongly oppose more help to Ukraine could make it difficult to pass the funding package through the House of Representatives. New House Speaker Mike Johnson has yet to reveal his position. ",https://dnd2oi6izkvoi.cloudfront.net/2023/10/29/image/jpeg/JFi0V2TR4bYqPWBCTRbwdyVyfNrc4rRaxHGP44fp.jpg,2023-10-29 00:00:00
https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/human-arm-dynamics-can-help-robots-assemble-satellites,Human arm dynamics can help robots assemble satellites,"A team of researchers from the Beijing Institute of Technology has developed a new method to control robots that can assemble satellites in space. The technique is inspired by the human arm, which can adjust its damping to perform different tasks with precision and stability. The researchers published their findings in Cyborg and Bionic Systems.Space operations require robots to interact with objects in complex and dynamic environments. However, traditional robot control methods have limitations in adapting to diverse and uncertain situations and are prone to vibration, which can cause assembly failure. To overcome these challenges, the researchers proposed a human-like variable admittance control method based on the variable damping characteristics of the human arm.Damping is the process of reducing the amplitude of oscillations or vibrations by dissipating energy. It is essential for preventing excessive contact force from damaging the objects during assembly. The human arm can flexibly adjust its damping to perform various tasks safely and stably. For example, when holding a fragile thing, the human arm reduces its damping to avoid breaking it, while when pushing a heavy object, it increases its damping to exert more force.The researchers mimicked this feature by designing a variable admittance controller for robots that can change their damping according to the contact conditions and the assembly requirements. The controller can also compensate for external disturbances and environmental uncertainties.CREDIT: CYBORG AND BIONIC SYSTEMS To test their method, the researchers built a dynamic data acquisition platform to capture human arm motion during assembly tasks. They used an ATI omega160 6D force sensor to measure the contact force between the human hand and the assembly parts and a Stereolabs ZED mini motion capture system to obtain the end velocity of the human arm. They analyzed the data and summarized the dynamic characteristics of the human component, as well as three contact patterns for satellite assembly: sliding contact, impact contact, and stable contact.The researchers then applied their method to a robot manipulator that can assemble satellite components in space. They conducted simulations and experiments to evaluate the performance of their method under different scenarios and compared it with other compliance control methods. They found that their approach can effectively improve the safety, robustness, and adaptability of robot space assembly.CREDIT: CYBORG AND BIONIC SYSTEMS  The researchers also verified their method through a ground experimental platform that simulated space satellite assembly. Their robotic platform could measure forces and torques at the end of a robotic arm in the X, Y, and Z directions. They applied the human-like variable parameter admittance controller to the robot satellite assembly experiment and successfully verified the effectiveness of their method.Developing control strategies that emulate human-like behavior can significantly enhance the adaptability, precision, and controllability of robots that perform assembly and maintenance tasks in space. Nevertheless, more research is necessary to enable robots to accomplish flexible assembly tasks comparable to those performed by humans. Additionally, there is a need for durable and reliable robots that can withstand harsh space environments. According to Zhihong Jiang, a professor at the Beijing University of Technology, advancements in humanoid control strategies hold important implications for the future of space exploration and development, further improving mission efficiency, safety, and reliability.On-orbit assembly has become a crucial aspect of space operations, where the manipulator frequently and directly interacts with objects in a complex assembly process. The traditional manipulator control has limitations in adapting to diverse assembly tasks and is vulnerable to vibration, leading to assembly failure. To address this issue, we propose a human-like variable admittance control method based on the variable damping characteristics of the human arm. By collecting the velocity and contact force of human arm operations in assembly, we analyze the damping change of human arm and establish the active compliance model based on S-type damping variation rule in assembly. Furthermore, 3 passive contact models are proposed between the end of the human arm and the environment: one-sided bevel contact, both sides bevel contact, and pin–hole contact. On the basis of these active and passive models, a typical space assembly task for a robot is designed, and a human-like variable admittance controller is established and simulated. Finally, we build a ground verification platform and complete different assembly tasks, thereby successfully verifying the safety, robustness, and adaptability of the human-like variable admittance control method.

https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/research-says-blocking-a-motor-protein-can-stop-breast-cancer-cells,How a motor protein can stop breast cancer invasion,"Metastasis is a challenging aspect of breast cancer that makes it difficult to cure. This process involves the spread of cancer cells from the breast to other parts of the body, like the lungs, bones, and brain, and is responsible for the high mortality rate associated with this disease.But what if there was a way to stop breast cancer cells from moving and invading healthy tissues? A new study by Penn State and other institutions has found a possible answer: dynein protein.Dynein is a motor protein that helps cells move along tiny tracks called microtubules. The researchers discovered that dynein is also responsible for powering the movement of breast cancer cells in soft tissue models that mimic the human body.The study, published in the journal Advanced Science, shows that by blocking dynein, the cancer cells become paralyzed and unable to migrate. This could offer a new way to prevent metastasis and improve the chances of survival for breast cancer patients.According to Erdem Tabdanov, a lead co-corresponding author on the study and assistant professor of pharmacology at Penn State, the findings are groundbreaking in multiple aspects. He explains that dynein's involvement in cancer cell motility is a new discovery and that targeting dynein could be an effective way to prevent the spread of cancer cells.The study was a collaboration between Penn State’s Department of Chemical Engineering and College of Medicine, as well as researchers from the University of Rochester Medical Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Emory University, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.The researchers used live microscopy to observe the movement of live breast cancer cells in two different systems. The first system was a two-dimensional network of collagen fibers, which represents the extracellular matrix that surrounds tumors. The second system was a three-dimensional network of microscopic hydrogel particles or microgels, which simulate soft tissue.In both systems, the researchers found that dynein was essential for the movement of cancer cells. When they inhibited dynein with drugs or genetic tools, the cancer cells became stuck and unable to move.Amir Sheikhi, an assistant professor of chemical engineering and biomedical engineering at Penn State, discovered that dynein is crucial for the invasion of cancer cells using three-dimensional models that resemble a tumor. This breakthrough suggests a new strategy for managing cancer that involves stopping the cancer cells from moving instead of killing them with radiation or chemotherapy, which can also damage healthy cells. This is a promising development because it means that destroying the cells is not necessary, only halting their movement.Tabdanov explained that paralyzing the cancer cells could be a better strategy than chemotherapy, which tries to kill the cancer cells faster than they can damage the body. Chemotherapy can also cause side effects such as hair loss, nausea, and fatigue.“Chemotherapy is like a race against time,” Tabdanov said. “It causes a lot of collateral damage to the body’s normal tissues while it is fighting the cancer. If we can contain the cancer, stop it from spreading, we can preserve the health of the body.”The researchers cautioned that their findings are still preliminary and must be tested in human or animal trials before they can be applied to clinical practice. Sheikhi has filed several patents related to his team’s platform and plans to use it to study other diseases besides cancer.The principal cause of death in cancer patients is metastasis, which remains an unresolved problem. Conventionally, metastatic dissemination is linked to actomyosin-driven cell locomotion. However, the locomotion of cancer cells often does not strictly line up with the measured actomyosin forces. Here, a complementary mechanism of metastatic locomotion powered by dynein-generated forces is identified. These forces arise within a non-stretchable microtubule network and drive persistent contact guidance of migrating cancer cells along the biomimetic collagen fibers. It is also shown that the dynein-powered locomotion becomes indispensable during invasive3D migration within a tissue-like luminal network formed by spatially-confining granular hydrogel scaffolds (GHS) made up of microscale hydrogel particles (microgels). These results indicate that the complementary motricity mediated by dynein is always necessary and, in certain instances, sufficient for disseminating metastatic breast cancer cells. These findings advance the fundamental understanding of cell locomotion mechanisms and expand the spectrum of clinical targets against metastasis.

https://interestingengineering.com/transportation/cruise-hits-the-brakes-on-driverless-cars-after-safety-concerns,GM's Cruise suspends driverless cars amid safety probes,"Cruise, the self-driving car company owned by General Motors, has put its driverless operations on hold nationwide after California regulators revoked its license over safety issues.As per an AP report, the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) said Cruise had provided false or misleading information about the performance of its autonomous technology, which had recently started carrying passengers in San Francisco.Cruise is also facing scrutiny from federal authorities, who are looking into reports of possible dangers to pedestrians and passengers from its driverless cars. Earlier the self-driving car company also decided to halve its driving fleet in San Fransisco after the California Department of Motor Vehicles ordered it to limit its fleet by a maximum of 50 by day and 150 by night. In a post on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, Cruise said it had decided to “proactively pause driverless operations across all of our fleets while we take time to examine our processes, systems, and tools and reflect on how we can better operate in a way that will earn public trust.”Cruise added that the decision was unrelated to any new incidents on the road and that it would continue to operate its autonomous vehicles with human supervision, even under California’s indefinite ban.The suspension is a significant setback for General Motors, which had high hopes for Cruise as a source of revenue and innovation. The Detroit-based automaker had projected that Cruise would generate $1 billion in annual revenue by 2025, a massive leap from the $106 million it made last year.Cruise has also expanded its testing of robotaxi services to other cities, such as Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Austin.The DMV did not specify what safety information Cruise had misrepresented. Still, it came after a series of incidents that raised questions about the reliability and safety of its driverless cars.Earlier this month, a Cruise robotaxi ran over a pedestrian who had been hit by another human-driven car. The pedestrian was trapped under the tire of the Cruise car, which then dragged him for about 20 feet (six meters) as it tried to move away from the scene.The DMV and other critics accused Cruise of not sharing all the video footage of the accident, but Cruise denied this, saying it had given the full video to state and federal officials. In a statement on Tuesday, Cruise said it was cooperating with the authorities investigating the October 2 accident and that its engineers were working on improving its robotaxis’ response “to this kind of extremely rare event.”However, some experts remained skeptical of Cruise’s explanation and demanded more transparency. Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina who studies automated vehicles, wanted to know “who knew what when?” at Cruise and General Motors after the accident.Also this month, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced that it was investigating Cruise’s autonomous vehicle division after receiving reports of incidents where its cars may have failed to yield to pedestrians in crosswalks and other areas.The NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation said it had received two reports of pedestrian injuries involving Cruise cars. It also found two more incidents from online videos but said the total number was unknown.Last December, the NHTSA opened another probe into reports of Cruise’s robotaxis that stopped abruptly or stalled, leaving passengers stranded. The investigation was triggered by three rear-end collisions after Cruise cars braked hard.According to a letter dated October 20 made public on Thursday, the NHTSA received five more reports of Cruise cars stopping unexpectedly with no obstacles ahead. All these cases involved cars operating without human supervision. ",https://dnd2oi6izkvoi.cloudfront.net/2023/10/29/image/jpeg/R2rNQNluqvBfUCYknbo4wgJ96sO03C0QleMI6j8u.jpg,2023-10-29 00:00:00
