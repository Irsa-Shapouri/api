This year, the conference will be held in June, and while the exact dates have not been announced yet, we can make some educated guesses based on past years.

In previous years, Apple typically announced the date of WWDC around this time. However, in 2021 and 2022, the announcement came in late March and early April, respectively. Therefore, we can expect the announcement to be made soon. 

As for the actual dates of the conference, WWDC has traditionally taken place in early June, unless there are exceptional circumstances like a pandemic. In 2020, due to Covid-19, the dates were pushed to late June. However, in most years, WWDC starts on the first Monday of June and runs until Friday. 

Based on this pattern, we can anticipate that WWDC 2024 will likely take place from Monday, June 3 to Friday, June 7. However, there is also a possibility that it could be the week after, running from Monday, June 10 to Friday, June 14. 

In recent years, WWDC has undergone a transformation in its format. In 2020, the keynote was pre-recorded, and there were no in-person attendees. This was a significant departure from previous years when thousands of people gathered in a large auditorium to watch the keynote live. 

Since then, every keynote has been recorded, but there has been an increase in the number of attendees in Cupertino. While still a fraction of the pre-Covid years, last year's attendance numbers were higher than the previous year. 

For this year's WWDC, it is expected that the keynote will be recorded, featuring Tim Cook and Craig Federighi live on stage at Apple Park. There will also be a limited number of attendees, including VIPs, press, staff, and a small group of participants. 

Apple always times its keynotes for 10 a.m. local time, specifically Pacific Daylight Time. 

As soon as the official announcement is made, we will provide further updates. Stay tuned for the latest news on WWDC 2024!",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600830c22fb840e0281afe2/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 16:00:15,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/marshallshepherd/2024/03/24/science-engagement-shapes-lives-and-changes-perceptions-too/,Science Engagement Shapes Lives And Changes Perceptions Too,"Science at Emory University. She invited me to speak to a group of kids from the East Suburban Atlanta Chapter of Jack and Jill of America, Inc. about my career as an atmospheric scientist. It was a wonderful opportunity to engage with young minds and inspire them to pursue STEM careers.

Growing up as an only child of a single mother, I spent a lot of time exploring nature and developing a fascination with insects, streams, and the weather. While I didn't know the specific terms like entomology and stream ecology back then, these interests were already brewing within me. However, it was a severe bee sting that changed my trajectory. After being stung, I developed a severe bee sting allergy, which led me to pivot towards studying weather. In fact, my sixth-grade science project was all about weather.

Throughout my childhood, I didn't have many scientists as role models in my immediate circle. However, I was very familiar with the pioneering work of Dr. George Washington Carver, an agricultural scientist at Tuskegee Institute. My mother, an alumna of the university, introduced me to his accomplishments with peanuts. Although I never had the chance to meet him in person, he became my first mentor through the pages of books. Carver's passion for understanding the ""how's and why's"" of science inspired me to dive deeper into meteorology, beyond just forecasting. Today, as a seasoned scientist with several National Academies honors, I am grateful for the opportunity to engage with young minds directly and share my experiences.

Unfortunately, even today, there are still barriers for Black youth pursuing STEM careers. A 2022 Pew Center study reveals that positive perceptions about STEM within the Black American community remain low. The study found that professional athletes and musicians are often seen as reaching the highest levels of success, while scientists and engineers are ranked lowest. This perception gap needs to be addressed and changed.

One of the potential barriers identified in the study is the lack of visible examples of Black achievement in science and related fields. This lack of representation can deter Black individuals from pursuing STEM education and careers. Additionally, Black students earn a smaller percentage of bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees compared to other racial groups. These statistics highlight the need for more support and opportunities for Black students to excel in STEM.

Furthermore, the study also indicates that STEM fields feel less welcoming for certain racial groups and women. As the former president of the American Meteorological Society, I have personally experienced and observed instances where the field lacked inclusivity. To create a more inclusive STEM ecosystem, we need to focus on multiple pathways:

1. Increase visible examples of achievement from diverse groups: By highlighting successful Black scientists and engineers, we can inspire the next generation to pursue STEM careers.

2. Enable vigorous and sustained mentorship: Mentorship plays a crucial role in guiding and supporting aspiring scientists. Establishing mentorship programs can provide valuable guidance and encouragement.

3. Establish the viability of STEM careers: Cultural perceptions often dictate what careers are seen as successful. By showcasing the opportunities and impact of STEM careers, we can challenge these perceptions and present science as a viable and fulfilling path.

4. Focus on retention efforts: Keeping students and professionals engaged in STEM requires creating an inclusive and supportive environment. By addressing issues of inclusivity and providing resources for professional development, we can retain talent within the field.

5. Embrace diversity of ideas: STEM research and development thrive when diverse perspectives are included. Encouraging collaboration and valuing different ideas fosters innovation and progress.

The event I attended this weekend was a testament to the power of engagement and mentorship. Speaking to the kids from the East Suburban Atlanta Chapter of Jack and Jill of America, Inc. was an incredible experience. It reminded me of the importance of reaching out to young minds and inspiring them to pursue their passions, regardless of societal expectations. By nurturing their curiosity and providing guidance, we can shape the future of STEM and create a more inclusive and diverse scientific community.

In conclusion, as an atmospheric scientist, I am committed to promoting scientific engagement and breaking down barriers for underrepresented groups in STEM. By increasing visibility, providing mentorship, challenging cultural perceptions, focusing on retention, and embracing diversity of ideas, we can foster a more inclusive and vibrant scientific community. Let's empower the next generation of scientists and change the narrative surrounding Black achievement in STEM.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660034c3235190ae18aa9cf0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 11:18:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have surprising similarities in their growth trajectories. Both companies stumbled upon their core businesses by chance. AWS discovered the potential of selling its internal services, while Nvidia realized that its GPU, originally created for gaming, was ideal for processing AI workloads. This realization led to explosive revenue growth for both companies.

Nvidia's revenue has been soaring, growing from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024 to $22.1 billion in Q4 2024. However, the majority of this growth comes from Nvidia's data center business. On the other hand, AWS has consistently been a major revenue driver for Amazon, although its growth has started to slow down. As Microsoft and Google entered the market, the cloud computing industry became more competitive. Despite this, both Nvidia and AWS had the advantage of being early players in the market.

The rise of web apps and mobile technology in the early 2010s coincided with the increasing popularity of cloud computing. Enterprises recognized the value of moving their workloads to the cloud instead of maintaining their own data centers. Similarly, the demand for GPUs skyrocketed as AI and large language models gained traction.

While AWS has become a highly profitable business, Nvidia's growth is surpassing it. However, Nvidia needs to sustain this growth to become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS. If the GPU market tightens, Nvidia has other businesses, but they are smaller revenue generators and growing at a slower pace.

In terms of short-term financial outlook, Nvidia's revenue growth has been remarkable in recent quarters. The company expects to generate $24 billion in revenue in its current quarter, representing a 234% growth compared to the previous year. Although Nvidia's growth rate is expected to decline, it is still projected to continue scaling its revenue past the $100 billion annual run rate mark.

Looking ahead, AI is expected to be a significant driver of growth for Nvidia. Despite increasing competition from AMD, Intel, and other chipmakers, Nvidia maintains a strong position in the market, controlling a large market share. While competition will inevitably intensify, Nvidia's current dominance allows it some leeway.

In conclusion, Nvidia's growth trajectory resembles that of AWS, with both companies experiencing significant revenue growth due to their core businesses. Although AWS's growth has slowed down, Nvidia's growth shows no signs of stopping. The future looks promising for Nvidia, especially with the continued demand for AI processing and its strong market position.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/techcrunch-mobility-the-wheels-are-starting-to-come-off-the-fisker-ev-bus/,TechCrunch Mobility: The wheels are starting to come off the Fisker EV bus,"Welcome to TechCrunch Mobility, your go-to source for all things transportation. In this week's newsletter, we'll discuss the latest developments in the automotive industry, including proposed standards from the Biden Administration, Uber's investment in an Africa-founded startup, Apple's antitrust suit involving cars, and DoorDash's partnership with Wing for drone delivery.

But before we dive into all that, let's take a quick look at what's been happening on Capitol Hill. The Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have released two new proposed standards that will have a significant impact on U.S. automakers and consumers. While these regulations have been softened to accommodate industry stakeholders, they still impose stricter requirements than before.

The DOE's ""petroleum equivalency factor"" assigns a score to electric vehicles (EVs) under the government's corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. Initially, this proposal would have made it challenging for automakers to meet the CAFE standards, resulting in hefty fines. Fortunately, the updated version is more lenient.

Meanwhile, the EPA has set tailpipe standards for 2027 to 2032 model year vehicles, which will impose tougher requirements on automakers. However, they also offer more flexibility in meeting these rules through various powertrain options. In other words, the standards are technology-agnostic and don't necessarily require a complete shift to battery electric vehicles. This is a significant departure from the original proposal, which aimed for 67% EV sales in the U.S. passenger vehicle market by 2032.

What does all this mean for EV startups? Well, not much, as companies like Rivian, Tesla, and Lucid already meet the clean car standards. However, legacy automakers, who are investing heavily in EVs while still profiting from internal combustion engine vehicles, will face challenges. Interestingly, plug-in hybrids might emerge as winners in this scenario.

Now, let's move on to the latest news. We'll cover Rivian's partnership with Tesla, an electric boat startup called Candela, the ongoing financial troubles at Fisker, a startup focused on extended warranties, and more exciting updates.

Speaking of startups, let's talk about Clevon, a company that has been developing autonomous delivery technology since 2018. Rumor had it that the company was struggling to find new investment and might shut down. However, recent reports suggest that Clevon is still operational and has entered into an exclusivity agreement for a merger with an American electric vehicle company. While details are scarce, the merger is expected to be completed by the first half of June. Unfortunately, the agreement has led to some cost reductions, resulting in layoffs.

In other news, Uber has made its first investment in an Africa-founded startup. Moove, a mobility fintech company, raised $100 million in a Series B funding round led by Uber. Moove offers vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers and is valued at $750 million. This investment aligns with Uber's goal of achieving a fully zero-emission fleet by 2040.

Lastly, we have some noteworthy deals from the past week. Amber, a Bay Area startup, raised $3.18 million in a seed round to support its aftermarket Tesla extended warranty product. Candela, the electric boat maker, secured $25 million in funding from Groupe Beneteau and other investors. And Pelikan Mobility, a French startup, received funding to develop its electric scooters.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/24/when-to-see-a-great-un-american-eclipse---from-iceland-to-australia/,When To See A ‘Great Un-American Eclipse’ - From Spain To Australia,"On Monday, April 8, a total solar eclipse will occur in North America, marking a significant moment for celestial events on Earth. Approximately 12 million Americans witnessed totality during the eclipse on August 21, 2017, and another 31 million will have the opportunity to do so on April 8, 2024.

For those who don't want to wait for the next total solar eclipse on U.S. soil, there are options for experiencing this rare phenomenon by traveling to different parts of the world. During a total solar eclipse, only a small portion of the Earth's surface is covered by the moon's shadow, and within that path lies the opportunity to witness totality—sudden darkness during the day, rapid cooling, eerie light, strange animal behavior, and a chance to see the sun's corona.

Here are some upcoming total solar eclipses and the recommended locations to witness them:

1. Greenland, Iceland, and Northern Spain Eclipse: August 12, 2026
This eclipse will offer a two-minute totality, and Iceland, particularly the western tip of the Snæfellsnes Peninsula and Reykjavik, will be great places to observe it. Northern Spain is also an option, although the eclipse will occur dangerously close to sunset.

2. North African Eclipse: August 2, 2027
This eclipse will offer a massive totality of over six minutes, making it the longest one left this century. The path of totality will cross southern Spain and much of North Africa, but Luxor in Egypt, known for the Valley of the Kings and Karnak, will be the prime location to experience a whopping six minutes and 20 seconds of totality.

3. Australia and New Zealand Eclipse: July 22, 2028
Sydney Harbour in Australia will be the ideal place to witness this eclipse, with three minutes and 44 seconds of totality. However, if you want to ensure a clear sky, the Australian Outback is a great option. Queenstown in New Zealand will also see totality close to sunset.

4. Southern Africa and South Australia Eclipse: November 25, 2030
Southern Africa will be a fantastic destination to experience a two-minute totality before embarking on a game drive in Namibia and Botswana. South Australia will also witness the eclipse an hour or so before sunset. Which continent would you prefer to visit?

5. Pacific Ocean Eclipse: November 14, 2031
To witness this hybrid solar eclipse, you'll need to take a long and solitary cruise from Hawaii. The spectacle will transition from a ""ring fire"" annular solar eclipse to a total solar eclipse southeast of Hawaii, and then back again.

6. Alaska and Siberia Eclipse: March 30, 2033
This eclipse will offer a two-minute totality from Alaska and also provide an opportunity to see the Northern Lights. While clear skies for the Great Bering Strait eclipse are unlikely, it's still worth visiting remote Alaskan towns like Barrow/Utqiagvik, Prudhoe Bay/Sagavanirktok, and Kotzebue. If the weather cooperates, the northern lights may make an appearance during totality.

7. Central Africa and Asia Eclipse: March 20, 2034
This will be the first ""equinox eclipse"" since 2015, and the path of totality will provide four minutes and nine seconds of totality to Central Africa and South Asia. Southeastern Egypt is a recommended location, and eclipse chasers will flock there for this lengthy eclipse. The UNESCO World Heritage Site of Persopolis in Iran is another option. The path of totality will pass through several countries, including Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, Sudan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Nepal.

8. China, North Korea, and Japan Eclipse: September 2, 2035
For this East Asian eclipse, Beijing in China or Tokyo in Japan will be the best places to go. Just north of Beijing, you can witness almost two minutes of totality, similar to Pyongyang in North Korea. However, a trip just north of Tokyo will provide an additional 30 seconds of totality.

9. Australia and New Zealand Eclipse: July 13, 2037
During this mid-winter eclipse, various locations in Australia, such as Geraldton, Uluru (Ayers Rock), Byron Bay, the Gold Coast, and the remote Lord Howe Island, will be thrown under the moon's shadow for as long as three minutes and 58 seconds. The North Island of New Zealand will also have the opportunity to witness totality, including the Ngauruhoe volcano (Mount Doom in The Lord of the Rings films) in Tongariro National Park and coastal Napier in Hawke's Bay.

10. Australia and New Zealand Eclipse: December 26, 2038
If you still have any air miles left from events 18 months prior, this mid-summer eclipse will occur mainly over the remote Australian Outback. However, the path of totality will pass just north of both Australia and New Zealand, offering a unique opportunity to witness this celestial event.

These upcoming total solar eclipses provide incredible opportunities to witness the wonders of the universe. Whether you're traveling to Greenland, Iceland, Northern Spain, Luxor, Sydney Harbour, or any other recommended location, make sure to plan ahead and prepare for an unforgettable experience.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6596ce996dfc8e3f5f161c42/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 13:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
