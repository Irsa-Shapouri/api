These processors have practical applications in various fields such as logistics, resource allocation, and the discovery of drugs and materials. In order for annealing processors to be effective, the components need to be fully ""coupled,"" which means that their complexity directly affects the scalability of the processors.

A recent study led by Professor Takayuki Kawahara from Tokyo University of Science has introduced a scalable processor that divides the calculation into multiple LSI chips. This innovative approach was presented at the IEEE 22nd World Symposium on Applied Machine Intelligence and Informatics (SAMI 2024) on January 25, 2024.

According to Prof. Kawahara, the goal is to achieve advanced information processing directly at the edge, rather than relying on cloud computing or performing preprocessing at the edge for the cloud. The team at Tokyo University of Science has developed a fully coupled LSI on one chip using 28nm CMOS technology. They have also devised a scalable method using parallel-operating chips and demonstrated its feasibility using FPGAs in 2022.

To create the scalable annealing processor, the researchers utilized 36 22nm CMOS calculation LSI chips and one control FPGA. This technology enables the construction of large-scale, fully coupled semiconductor systems based on the Ising model with 4096 spins.

The processor incorporates two distinct technologies developed at Tokyo University of Science. The first is a ""spin thread method"" that allows for 8 parallel solution searches, while the second is a technique that reduces chip requirements by about half compared to conventional methods. In terms of power consumption, the processor operates at 10MHz with a power consumption of 2.9W (1.3W for the core part), which is relatively modest. This was validated using a vertex cover problem with 4096 vertices.

In terms of power performance ratio, the processor outperforms a simulated fully coupled Ising system on a PC (i7, 3.6GHz) using annealing emulation by 2,306 times. It also surpasses the core CPU and arithmetic chip by 2,186 times.

The successful verification of this processor suggests the potential for enhanced capacity. Prof. Kawahara envisions the social implementation of this technology, including initiating a business, joint research, and technology transfer. The goal is to develop this technology for an LSI system with the computing power of a 2050-level quantum computer for solving combinatorial optimization problems. The aim is to achieve this without the need for air conditioning, large equipment, or cloud infrastructure using current semiconductor processes. By 2030, the team hopes to achieve 2 million spins and explore the creation of new digital industries using this technology.

In conclusion, researchers at Tokyo University of Science have successfully developed a scalable, fully coupled annealing processor with 4096 spins. This processor incorporates key innovations such as chip reduction and parallel operations for simultaneous solution searches. The findings of this study pave the way for further advancements in the field of annealing processors and their applications in solving combinatorial optimization problems.
