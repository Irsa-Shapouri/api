Lazy Sunday is here, and with it comes the challenge of solving Wordle. But before we dive into that, let's talk about Easter and rabbit pot pies. The thought of enjoying a savory rabbit pot pie on Easter is quite intriguing, isn't it? Maybe one day we'll make it happen. But for now, let's focus on cracking today's Wordle puzzle.

Today's Hint: Useful when dry, useless when wet.
Today's Clue: The word starts with a consonant.

And the answer is... (spoiler alert)
Today's Wordle Solution: TOWEL

Wordle Analysis

I started off with a wild guess of ""chain,"" which led to a high word count of 681. Thankfully, ""slope"" brought it down to a more manageable 19. I eventually landed on ""towel,"" a fitting choice considering the Strands puzzle I tackled earlier. It's funny how things sometimes align perfectly, isn't it?

Competitive Wordle Score

Unfortunately, today's Wordle round was a wash for me. Zero points for guessing in four tries and zero for tying the Bot. Better luck next time!

Today's Wordle Etymology

The word ""towel"" has roots in Old French with the term ""touaille,"" which made its way into English around the 13th century. This evolution from Old French to modern English reflects the linguistic influences of Norman French on the English language post the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. Towels have been a household staple for centuries, serving the same purpose of drying or wiping, despite changes in material and design.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/apple-sued-microsofts-ai-ambitions-and-nvidia-surprises/,"Apple sued, Microsoft's AI ambitions and Nvidia's surprises","Welcome to this edition of Week in Review, where we bring you the latest updates on tech news. In this week's edition, we have major news regarding the Apple antitrust lawsuit and Microsoft's AI ambitions. Let's dive right in.

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has joined international regulators in accusing Apple of using monopolistic tactics to lock in iPhone users. Apple, on the other hand, argues that the DOJ's actions could jeopardize what its users love about its phones and ecosystem.

While the DOJ's lawsuit draws parallels between Apple and Microsoft in the 1990s, there are significant differences in how the two companies have approached customer retention.

However, it's important to note that this lawsuit is unlikely to have immediate results. Experts predict that it could take several years, possibly three to five, to reach a resolution.

Now, let's move on to other updates from the tech world.

Microsoft recently acquired the co-founders of Inflection AI, a prominent AI startup. Mustafa Suleyman will now lead Microsoft AI's consumer-facing unit, while Karén Simonyan has been appointed as the EVP and CEO of the same group. This acquisition comes after Inflection raised $1.3 billion, with Microsoft being its largest investor.

Nvidia's GTC event had some interesting surprises. CEO Jensen Huang predicted that artificial general intelligence is just five years away. Additionally, Nvidia announced a new AI platform called GR00T, designed for humanoid robots.

Google and Apple are reportedly in talks to deploy Google's AI model on iPhones. It remains to be seen whether this partnership will be temporary or long-term, or if it will even materialize at all.

In the realm of hacking and privacy, the Biden administration is assembling an international coalition to combat commercial spyware. Interestingly, some investors who are now part of the coalition were previously involved in the very business they are now fighting against.

In gaming news, a hack disrupted a $5 million Apex Legends tournament. The hackers claimed to have done it for fun and to draw attention to the exploit used.

Glassdoor, the platform known for employee reviews, is facing complaints from users who claim that their real names are being added to their profiles without consent. Currently, the only solution provided to affected users is to delete their accounts entirely.

Moving on to funding and IPOs, Reddit's IPO got off to a strong start. The stock jumped 48% on its first day, closing at $46 after launching at $34 per share.

Astera Labs, a company that manufactures connectivity hardware for cloud computing data centers, saw a 72% increase in its stock on the first day of trading. With revenue growing by 45% to $115.8 million last year, the company's stock closed at $62.03 on day one.

The Browser Company, the startup behind the Arc browser, raised $50 million at a valuation of $550 million. The company has an ambitious vision of supplanting PCs with browsers but is still unclear about its path to monetization.

In our bonus round, we explore why AI-generated images often have spelling errors. Despite its massive potential, AI still struggles with basic spelling, and we delve into the reasons behind this phenomenon.

Lastly, Fisker, an electric vehicle manufacturer, has temporarily halted production due to financial difficulties. If the company fails to secure additional funding, it may have to cease operations altogether.

In conclusion, while the Apple antitrust lawsuit and Microsoft's AI ambitions have dominated the news this week, there have been several other noteworthy updates from the tech industry. From acquisitions to IPOs and privacy concerns, the tech world continues to evolve and surprise us. Stay tuned for more exciting developments in the coming weeks.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/apple-antitrust-doj-splash.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-23 20:15:37,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2024/03/23/apple-iphone-16-pro-ios-18-ai-china-baidu-google-gemini/,Apple’s Latest AI Move To Change Your New iPhone,"As Apple gears up to unveil its plans for AI integration in the iPhone, it seems that the tech giant is forging a potential partnership not only with Google but also with China's Baidu. With the rise of generative AI in flagship Android phones, Apple's iPhone 15 lineup has fallen behind in the AI game. While AI features like image processing and predictive text input are already present in Apple's software, generative AI will only be introduced in the upcoming iOS 18, which is expected to launch at the Worldwide Developer Conference this summer and be available on the next-generation iPhone 16 series.

Like other smartphone manufacturers, Apple will focus on on-device and in-the-cloud AI processing. Apple CEO Tim Cook and his team are known for prioritizing user privacy by keeping as much data as possible on the device for local processing. However, for AI applications that require extensive processing, leveraging the cloud becomes necessary.

To meet this need, Apple is reportedly seeking a partnership with Google to utilize its Gemini generative AI service. Despite being competitors in the smartphone market, Apple and Google have collaborated on various fronts, such as making Google the default search engine on Apple devices. This collaboration has proven fruitful for both companies. Google would undoubtedly be attracted to the millions of iPhone users who could potentially adopt their AI services, especially as they aim to establish their AI system against competitors like OpenAI.

However, there is a hurdle in this potential partnership. Google's Gemini AI service is unavailable in China due to factors like coal regulations and government regulations on generative AI modems. Consequently, Apple has initiated negotiations with China's Baidu to include its cloud-based AI services in the upcoming iOS 18 and iPhone 16 lineup, as reported by The Wall Street Journal's Raffaele Huang. This move aligns with Samsung's recent strategy, as they revealed not only the new Galaxy S24 series at Galaxy Unpacked but also their own Galaxy AI services, some of which rely on Google Gemini. To cater to the Chinese market, Samsung has partnered with Baidu for AI services.

It remains to be seen how Apple will differentiate its AI services on a technical level when they are built on the same underlying technology as its rivals. The competition in the AI space is fierce, and companies are constantly striving to offer unique and innovative solutions to users.

In conclusion, Apple's upcoming iOS 18 and iPhone 16 series are expected to bring generative AI capabilities to the iPhone, catching up with its Android counterparts. While a potential partnership with Google for AI services seems promising, Apple is also exploring collaboration with China's Baidu to cater to the Chinese market. As the AI landscape continues to evolve, it will be fascinating to see how Apple distinguishes itself and delivers a compelling AI experience to its users.

Severino was disqualified for biting Lima in the second round. 

Pressure in combat sports can lead to unexpected behavior, as demonstrated in the recent UFC Fight Night: Ribas vs. Namajunas event. In his UFC debut, Igor Severino shocked viewers by biting his fellow Brazilian fighter, Andre Lima, during their preliminary match.

The disqualification came after images clearly showed bite marks on Lima's arm, inflicted while Severino was in a grappling position behind him. This incident, while rare, has cast a shadow on Severino's promising career in the UFC, making it difficult for him to return to the promotion.

Severino, only 20 years old, suffered his first career loss with this disqualification, dropping his record to 9-1. In contrast, Lima maintained his undefeated status at 8-0. UFC CEO Dana White wasted no time in cutting ties with Severino, emphasizing the severity of his actions and the missed opportunity for the young fighter.

Biting has no place in combat sports, and Severino's actions have consequences beyond the octagon. He will need to rebuild his reputation in smaller promotions before earning a chance to compete at higher levels in the MMA world.

As the events in Las Vegas unfold, we await more traditional results from Saturday's matchups.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/23/explained-the-difference-between-a-solar-eclipse-and-a-lunar-eclipse/,Explained: The Difference Between A Solar Eclipse And A Lunar Eclipse,"Do you know the difference between a solar eclipse and a lunar eclipse? In the next few weeks, we will witness two celestial events—a lunar eclipse on Monday, March 25, and a solar eclipse on Monday, April 8. Although they may seem similar, these two phenomena have distinct characteristics and are caused by different celestial alignments.

Let's start with a lunar eclipse. This occurs when Earth's shadow is projected onto the moon, creating a stunning visual display. In contrast, a solar eclipse happens when the moon blocks the sun's light and casts a shadow on Earth. These events are relatively rare due to the slight differences in the orbital planes of the Earth and the moon around the sun.

Now, let's delve into the causes of each type of eclipse. A lunar eclipse can only occur during a full moon when Earth is positioned between the sun and the moon, projecting its shadow into space. While full moons happen every 29 days, lunar eclipses are infrequent because the moon rarely passes through Earth's shadow.

On the other hand, a solar eclipse can only take place during a new moon when the moon is situated between the sun and Earth, resulting in a shadow cast on our planet. New moons occur every 29 days, two weeks after a full moon. However, the moon rarely aligns perfectly to block the sun from our perspective on Earth, making solar eclipses less common.

For a total lunar eclipse to occur, the sun, Earth, and moon must be perfectly aligned. Earth has two shadows—the fuzzy outer penumbral shadow and the dark central umbral shadow. When a full moon enters Earth's umbra, it receives no direct light from the sun. Instead, its surface is bathed in sunlight refracted by Earth's atmosphere, giving it a pinkish-red hue. If you were standing on the moon during a lunar eclipse, you would witness the breathtaking sight of a ""Blood Moon"" and possibly even a partial or total solar eclipse.

On March 25, we will experience a penumbral lunar eclipse, where the full ""Worm Moon"" will pass through Earth's penumbra, creating a partial shadow.

In the case of a total solar eclipse, a perfect alignment of the sun, moon, and Earth is necessary. Similar to a new moon, the moon's shadow is divided into an outer penumbral shadow and a dark central umbral shadow. When the moon completely obscures the sun, its umbra is projected onto Earth. The shadow moves across Earth's surface due to the moon's west-to-east orbit, which coincides with Earth's rotation direction. This alignment results in a path of totality, where a total solar eclipse can be observed. If you were on the moon during a total solar eclipse, you would witness the moon's shadow crossing Earth.

On April 8, a total solar eclipse will occur as the new ""Pink Moon"" perfectly blocks the sun, casting an umbral shadow over North America.

Now, you may be wondering why lunar and solar eclipses are relatively rare events. This rarity is due to the moon's orbital tilt of approximately 5 degrees with respect to the sun's path through the sky. As a result, the moon's path intersects with the sun's path twice in each orbit, occurring monthly. However, for an eclipse to happen, the moon must be in its new or full phase. This scenario only occurs twice a year, creating two ""eclipse seasons"" during which solar and lunar eclipses are more likely. Nonetheless, most solar eclipses are either partial or annular (""ring of fire""), while lunar eclipses are often penumbral or partial.

Looking ahead, the next ""eclipse seasons"" will take place in 2024 and 2025. In 2024, there will be a penumbral lunar eclipse on March 25, a total solar eclipse on April 8, a partial lunar eclipse on September 17, and an annular solar eclipse on October 2. In 2025, the lunar eclipses will occur on March 13 and September 7, while the solar eclipses will take place on March 29 and September 21.

Have you ever witnessed a total solar eclipse? If you think you have, think again. Many people mistakenly believe they have seen a total solar eclipse when, in reality, they have only witnessed a partial solar eclipse. Total solar eclipses are incredibly rare and unforgettable events that leave a lasting impression on those lucky enough to experience them.

The truth is, if you have truly witnessed totality, where the sun is completely blocked by the moon, you would never forget it. It's not something you vaguely remember years later; it's a cherished memory that stays with you for the rest of your life. This is because witnessing a total solar eclipse requires being in the path of totality, the specific area on Earth where the moon fully obscures the sun. If you are outside this path, you will only see a partial solar eclipse, which is a completely different experience.

The Great American Eclipse of 2017 was one such rare event that brought totality to 12 U.S. states from Oregon to South Carolina. Approximately 12 million people lived within the path of totality, and another million traveled to witness this awe-inspiring phenomenon. If you were lucky enough to be on that path, you would remember the beautiful twilight-like sky, the silhouette of the moon, and the breathtaking sight of the sun's spiky white corona shining all around it. It's an experience that leaves an indelible mark on your soul.

If you're unsure whether you have truly seen a total solar eclipse or just a partial one, there are ways to check. Often, people mistakenly believe they witnessed a total solar eclipse during school or work activities. However, upon further inquiry, it becomes apparent that the memory involves solar eclipse glasses or pinhole cameras, indicating a partial solar eclipse. To be certain, you can use the Solar Eclipses Visibility Database to verify the location and date of your memory.

To help you determine if you have truly experienced a total solar eclipse, here is a list of all the total solar eclipses that have occurred in North America over the past 70 years. Each link provides an interactive map for you to explore. If the event you remember is not included on this list, it was likely a partial solar eclipse.

Now, the time has come for you to share the excitement of a total solar eclipse with those who only think they have seen one. Ask them when and where they believe they witnessed totality and what they remember about the experience. Then gently inform them of the upcoming event on April 8, 2024—a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for them to finally experience totality and join the exclusive ranks of those who have witnessed this incredible phenomenon. This time, it will be a shared experience for an astonishing 42 million people, including 32 million Americans, who already live within the path of totality.

On April 8, 2024, everyone in North America will be able to witness a partial solar eclipse. However, only those within a narrow 115-mile path that stretches across parts of Mexico, 15 U.S. states, and Canada will have the chance to experience totality. This path will cross five states in Mexico, 15 U.S. states, and six Canadian provinces, offering a unique opportunity for millions of people to witness the awe-inspiring beauty of a total solar eclipse.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2024/03/24/epa-didnt-ban-gas-cars-it-cut-air-pollution-so-we-can-breathe-easier/,EPA Didn’t Ban Gas Cars. It Cut Air Pollution So We Can Breathe Easier.,"On red air days, when pollution levels spike, the metallic taste of polluted air can be overwhelming, leaving a sting in your nose and lungs. It's a familiar experience for many, prompting warnings for vulnerable groups like the elderly, children, pregnant women, and those with respiratory conditions to stay indoors and avoid outdoor activities.

The primary culprit behind toxic air in most areas? Look no further than internal combustion engines powered by gas or diesel. With over two-thirds of Americans relying on personal vehicles for daily transportation, it's no surprise that transportation has become the leading source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. Light-duty vehicles alone contribute to nearly 60% of the pollution from this sector.

Addressing the pervasive air pollution issue necessitates a focus on reducing tailpipe emissions from vehicles. Fortunately, there's a proven solution at hand: tailpipe emissions standards. Recently, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency took a significant step by implementing new multi-pollutant regulations for light-duty and smaller medium-duty vehicles. These updated standards push automakers to embrace cleaner technologies, ensuring that new vehicles are more environmentally friendly than ever before.

The ability to choose a clean car should be a right for everyone. Those who prioritize reducing pollution should have the option to drive electric vehicles. Cleaner air isn't just a luxury—it's a necessity for public health.

Air pollution affects a staggering 36% of the U.S. population, impacting nearly 120 million individuals. Living in areas with unhealthy levels of pollution can lead to various respiratory issues, particularly in children, including emphysema, asthma, and chronic bronchitis. Marginalized communities, including people of color and those with lower incomes, bear a disproportionate burden from air pollution.

While the EPA's new pollution limits are cause for celebration among those who value clean air, profit-driven corporations see them as a threat. By spreading misinformation and portraying the standards as restrictive, these entities aim to sway public opinion against the regulations. In reality, the updated standards are long overdue and will benefit all Americans by promoting cleaner air and providing consumers with alternatives to fossil fuel vehicles.

Efforts to vilify the EPA's emission standards are driven by corporate interests seeking to maintain the status quo. However, it's essential to recognize that the EPA's regulations are rooted in science and aimed at protecting public health. The Clean Air Act, enacted in 1970, empowers the EPA to set air quality standards and regulate emissions from vehicles to safeguard public welfare.

The historical impact of the Clean Air Act is evident in the transformation of cities like New York and Los Angeles, where once-pervasive air pollution has significantly decreased. The development of technologies like catalytic converters and the shift to unleaded fuel exemplifies the positive outcomes of stringent emission standards. By upholding these regulations, we can continue to improve air quality and protect the health of our communities.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fe401fc35aefb76700b52e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 07:45:00,Innovation,Innovation

The cerebral areas located in the frontal lobe, responsible for attention, organizational skills, and emotional responses are abnormally active or have a specific anatomy.

A recent study involving 221,714 individuals with ADHD revealed that those prescribed ADHD stimulant medications had a lower risk of suicide attempts and psychiatric hospitalizations. Heidi Taipale and her team from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, found that four ADHD medications, including amphetamine, lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate, were associated with reduced psychiatric hospitalizations.

Specifically, lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate were linked to a decreased risk of suicidal behavior. In contrast, atomoxetine did not show a lower risk of psychiatric hospitalizations or suicidal behavior but was associated with fewer hospitalizations for non-psychiatric co-morbidities.

A study from 2019 in Sweden reported that individuals with ADHD had a 52% prevalence of psychiatric co-morbidities, compared to only 7% in those without ADHD. These co-morbidities included conditions like major depressive disorder, panic disorder, substance abuse, and more.

The researchers emphasized the importance of ADHD medications in improving functioning and quality of life. While stimulants have shown beneficial psychiatric outcomes, such as decreased risk of depression and suicide, they also carry potential adverse effects like psychosis and cardiovascular concerns.

The study, published in JAMA Network Open on March 20, 2024, followed individuals aged 16 to 65 with ADHD diagnoses in Sweden from 2006 to 2021. Results showed that lisdexamphetamine was effective in reducing psychiatric hospitalizations across different age groups, while methylphenidate appeared less effective in older adults.

Overall, ADHD medications were found to have a positive impact on psychiatric outcomes, with a decreased risk of non-psychiatric hospitalizations. The researchers highlighted the need for further investigation into the long-term effectiveness and safety of ADHD pharmacotherapies to optimize treatment strategies for individuals with ADHD.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/63c28dbb82c31b7412c92cf2/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 04:09:46,Innovation,Innovation
