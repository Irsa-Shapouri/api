https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-liquid-iron-battery-grid-energy.html,New all-liquid iron flow battery for grid energy storage,"A New Battery Design for Large-Scale Energy Storage

Researchers at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have developed a new battery design for large-scale energy storage that utilizes a commonplace chemical used in water treatment facilities. This design offers a safe, economical, and water-based solution using Earth-abundant materials. It also provides a potential solution for incorporating intermittent energy sources, such as wind and solar energy, into the nation's electric grid.

The researchers published their findings in the journal Nature Communications, highlighting the remarkable cycling stability of their lab-scale, iron-based battery. Over one thousand consecutive charging cycles, the battery maintained 98.7% of its maximum capacity. This is a significant improvement compared to previous studies on similar iron-based batteries, which reported a degradation in charge capacity two orders of magnitude higher over fewer charging cycles.

While iron-based flow batteries for large-scale energy storage have been around since the 1980s and are commercially available, this battery design stands out due to its unique liquid chemical formula. It combines charged iron with a neutral-pH phosphate-based liquid electrolyte, or energy carrier. The crucial chemical component, nitrogenous triphosphonate (NTMPA), is commercially available in industrial quantities as it is commonly used to inhibit corrosion in water treatment plants.

Phosphonates, including NTMPA, belong to a broad chemical family based on phosphorus. They are widely used in various applications, such as fertilizers and detergents, due to their water solubility and non-toxic nature.

The development of new flow battery technologies is crucial for modernizing the U.S. electric grid and providing a means to store energy from renewable sources like wind and solar power. The researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory aimed to find an electrolyte that could bind and store charged iron in a liquid complex at room temperature, under mild operating conditions, and with a neutral pH. Their motivation was to develop battery materials that are abundant on Earth and can be sourced domestically.

Flow batteries, as the name suggests, consist of two chambers filled with different liquids. These batteries charge through an electrochemical reaction and store energy in chemical bonds. When connected to an external circuit, they release the stored energy to power electrical devices. Unlike conventional batteries, flow batteries feature two external supply tanks of liquid that constantly circulate through them to provide the electrolyte, acting as the battery system's ""blood supply."" The larger the electrolyte supply tank, the more energy the flow battery can store.

Flow batteries can serve as backup generators for the electric grid and are a key component of decarbonization strategies aimed at storing energy from renewable sources. One advantage of flow batteries is their scalability, ranging from lab-bench scale to the size of a city block.

In the short term, grid operators are interested in locating battery energy storage systems (BESS) in urban or suburban areas near energy consumers. However, safety concerns often arise when implementing such systems. The aqueous flow battery design developed by the researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory could help address these concerns.

""A BESS facility using the chemistry similar to what we have developed here would have the advantage of operating in water at neutral pH,"" explained Aaron Hollas, a study author and team leader in the Battery Materials and Systems Group at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. ""In addition, our system uses commercially available reagents that haven't been previously investigated for use in flow batteries.""

The initial design by the research team achieved an energy density of up to 9 watt-hours per liter (Wh/L). While commercialized vanadium-based systems are more than twice as energy dense, at 25 Wh/L, the advantage of a system built with Earth-abundant materials is its scalability to provide the same energy output.

The future development of flow batteries using this new battery design holds promise for large-scale energy storage. By repurposing a commonplace chemical for water treatment, the researchers have opened up a pathway to a safe, economical, and environmentally-friendly solution for storing energy from renewable sources. This design will contribute to the modernization of the U.S. electric grid and the integration of intermittent energy sources, ultimately helping to create a more sustainable future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/new-all-liquid-iron-fl.jpg,2024-03-25 07:22:25,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-quantum-algorithm-high-quality-solutions.html,Novel quantum algorithm proposed for high-quality solutions to combinatorial optimization problems,"Combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) are complex problems that require finding the optimal solution in various fields such as logistics, supply chain management, machine learning, material design, and drug discovery. While classical computers struggle with these computationally intensive problems, quantum computers offer a potential solution due to their ability to leverage the quantum property of superposition.

Quantum computers utilize specialized qubits that can exist in multiple states simultaneously, allowing them to quickly solve large problems. However, when COPs involve constraints, traditional quantum algorithms like adiabatic quantum annealing face challenges in obtaining near-optimal solutions within the operation time of quantum computers.

To address this issue, Assistant Professor Tatsuhiko Shirai and Professor Nozomu Togawa from Waseda University in Japan have developed a post-processing variationally scheduled quantum algorithm (pVSQA). Published in the IEEE Transactions on Quantum Engineering, their algorithm combines variational scheduling and post-processing methods to achieve near-optimal solutions for constrained COPs on both quantum annealers and gate-based quantum computers.

The pVSQA algorithm begins by utilizing a quantum device to generate a variational quantum state through quantum computation. This state is then used to create a probability distribution function that includes both feasible and infeasible solutions within the constraints of the COP. The post-processing method is then employed to transform the infeasible solutions into feasible ones, resulting in a probability distribution that contains only feasible solutions. A classical computer calculates the energy expectation value of the cost function using this new probability distribution, and repeating this calculation leads to a near-optimal solution.

The researchers conducted experiments using both simulators and real quantum devices, such as a quantum annealer and a gate-type quantum device, to evaluate the performance of the pVSQA algorithm. The results demonstrated that pVSQA achieves near-optimal performance within a predetermined time on simulators and outperforms conventional quantum algorithms without post-processing on real quantum devices.

According to Dr. Shirai, this new method is crucial for addressing various social issues that require significant transformations. Examples include achieving a carbon-neutral society to combat climate change and realizing sustainable development goals to tackle challenges like increased energy demand and food shortages. Efficiently solving combinatorial optimization problems is essential for these long-term social transformations, and the pVSQA algorithm can play a significant role in their realization.

In summary, the development of the pVSQA algorithm represents a significant advancement in leveraging quantum computers to solve COPs. This innovation holds promise for addressing complex real-world problems across various domains and marks a crucial step forward in the field of quantum computing.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/christianmiller/2024/03/25/getting-more-impatient-when-the-end-is-in-sight-taylor-swifts-new-album-covid-vaccines-and-the-2020-presidential-election/,Getting More Impatient When the End Is in Sight,"Are you eagerly awaiting Taylor Swift's highly anticipated new album, ""The Tortured Poets Department""? As the release date draws nearer, you may find yourself experiencing a range of emotions. Are you becoming increasingly impatient, maintaining the same level of anticipation, or feeling relieved that the wait is almost over?

While all three reactions are valid, a recent study by Annabelle Roberts from the University of Texas and Ayelet Fishbach from the University of Chicago suggests that many people experience heightened impatience as they approach the end of their wait. Surprisingly, this impatience is not solely due to the time and energy invested in waiting but is driven by a desire for closure.

One of the main studies conducted by Roberts and Fishbach focused on the COVID-19 pandemic and the release of vaccines in the United States during the spring of 2021. They surveyed 161 participants at three different time points, starting with the announcement of the successful Pfizer trial. Participants were asked to rate their level of impatience regarding two aspects:

1. How impatient are you to get a coronavirus vaccine? (1 = not at all; 7 = very)
   - November 2020: 4.26
   - December 2020: 4.11
   - March 2021: 4.53

2. How impatient are you for the coronavirus pandemic to end? (1 = not at all; 7 = very)
   - November 2020: 5.86
   - December 2020: 5.76
   - March 2021: 5.77

The researchers discovered that participants' impatience for the vaccine increased over time, while their impatience for the end of the pandemic remained relatively stable. This indicates that the trajectory of impatience was influenced by the proximity to the end rather than the distance from the beginning. In simpler terms, as the end of the wait drew near, impatience intensified.

Another study conducted by Roberts and Fishbach examined the 2020 U.S. presidential race between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. They surveyed 215 participants in the days leading up to Election Day (November 3rd), including an extra day in their data set as the results were not settled until November 4th. The key finding was as follows:

- How impatient are you to find out who wins the 2020 presidential election? (1 = not at all; 7 = very)
   - October 31: 5.06
   - November 1: 5.03
   - November 2: 5.21
   - November 3: 5.45
   - November 4: 5.69

Interestingly, this trend held true for both Biden and Trump supporters, indicating a shared desire for closure regarding the election outcome.

In yet another study, participants were asked about their impatience while waiting for a bus. The researchers found that impatience increased as the time remaining for the bus to arrive decreased. It wasn't the total waiting time that influenced impatience but rather the amount of time left. Similar results were observed in studies involving imaginary scenarios such as waiting for a package, tracking the proximity of a delivery truck, or enduring a traffic delay.

The implications of this research by Roberts and Fishbach are noteworthy. One suggestion they make is for those in charge of a situation, such as government officials, nurses, or Amazon customer service, to provide earlier and more accurate information about delays. By overestimating rather than underestimating the wait time, they can better manage people's impatience. Another implication is for individuals anticipating a long-awaited event to plan ahead with engaging activities such as reading or listening to podcasts to help alleviate the surge in impatience.

For all the devoted Taylor Swift fans, known as Swifties, you can expect your impatience to intensify as the remaining days until the release of her new album (April 19th!) dwindle. Rest assured, once that day arrives, you will finally find the closure you've been eagerly anticipating.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65f253e5f8f81a9d16371132/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1350,759,x0,y0,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 20:53:11,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2024/03/25/generative-ai-can-create-just-about-everything-but-will-it-ever-create-jobs/,Generative AI Can Create Just About Everything-But Will It Ever Create Jobs?,"Generative AI: Redefining the Future of Work

The rise of generative AI has undoubtedly left an indelible mark on various industries. From writing letters and reports to even producing movie scripts, this technology has proven its mettle. However, its growing influence has also raised concerns about the fate of human workers. The downsizing of IBM's marketing and communications team, partly due to generative AI, is a clear testament to the changing landscape. In fact, a survey revealed that over a third of companies using AI reported worker replacements in 2023, with 44% expecting further layoffs in 2024.

With the rapid advancements in generative AI, the question no longer revolves around its capabilities. Instead, it is about how human workers can retain relevance in a post-gen-AI world. As we embrace a future defined by AI, one crucial truth becomes apparent: efficiency will always be a sound business strategy. Just as automation revolutionized manufacturing jobs, AI is poised to transform numerous white-collar roles, including marketing and beyond. Business executives, driven by the goal of maximizing profits, view any technology that enables faster work, increased productivity, and deeper insights as a positive development. Research suggests that by 2030, generative AI could automate one-third of the work currently performed in the US economy.

Amidst this transformative landscape, it is imperative to consider the risks and opportunities that generative AI presents for the future of work. While it may create new jobs, it is uncertain whether these positions will align with individual aspirations. The work landscape is likely to become fragmented and unfamiliar, but historical evidence shows that technological revolutions eventually give rise to new and unexpected roles.

Let us consider an intriguing scenario: if AI allows programmers to develop a new game 50% faster and with only 20% of the resources, the demand for programmers will decrease, even if more people want to play the game. It is crucial that we start rethinking our approach to work and our role within it as we continue to advance generative AI and future technologies. One thing remains certain – investing time in acquiring AI skills and embracing the automation and data-driven value creation behind it will be vital. In recent interviews, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang shared a perspective that challenges the conventional belief that becoming a programmer is the ultimate safety net.

So, which jobs are most susceptible to significant pullbacks due to generative AI? Here is a list of the top 10 roles that could see a 50-80% reduction in full-time equivalents (FTEs):

1. Website and copy development
2. Marketing automation
3. Sales and sales development representatives
4. Basic legal support for personal and business tax filing and basic business accounting
5. Customer service L1/L2
6. Light coding and application development
7. Social media content and press releases
8. Inventory management and optimization
9. HR and talent management and identification

While there are many more roles that could be affected, startups and small businesses can leverage vertical AI and LLM capabilities to enhance productivity and efficiency while reducing personnel costs.

OpenAI's Sam Altman suggests that we may witness single-person billion-dollar companies in the future. While this may seem far-fetched, it is increasingly probable that companies with 10-20 employees could generate over $100 million in revenue and potentially reach the billion-dollar mark through intelligent use of generative AI and chatbots.

Generative AI, while capable of being a competitor, can also be a friend. For the first time, individuals with limited design or writing skills can utilize AI to create visually stunning graphics and compelling content. AI can also gauge the success of marketing campaigns in real-time and make necessary adjustments. These advancements are undeniably impressive, and while generative AI may not be perfect and occasionally hallucinates, it continues to improve at an exponential pace with advancements in technology and algorithms.

So, how can you stay relevant when AI is capable of performing such remarkable feats? The answer lies in staying engaged. In a time when it is tempting to rely solely on AI to do the work, resist the urge. While AI undoubtedly offers immense assistance, it is crucial to maintain an active role. Embrace the opportunities for growth and development that AI brings, but do not forget the unique perspective and creativity that humans possess. By striking a balance between human ingenuity and AI capabilities, we can forge a path towards a future where both coexist harmoniously.

In conclusion, generative AI is reshaping the future of work. While it poses risks and challenges, it also presents numerous opportunities for growth and innovation. By adapting to this changing landscape, acquiring new skills, and embracing the potential of AI, we can navigate the evolving world of work and ensure our continued relevance. The key lies in our ability to stay engaged, strike a balance, and embrace the transformative power of generative AI.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660212b5f2d67f4b8ae63aa3/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 20:24:50,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/fisker-nissan-deal-dead-funding-bankruptcy/,"Fisker loses potential Nissan deal, putting rescue funds at risk","The negotiations between Fisker, an electric vehicle (EV) startup, and a large automaker, rumored to be Nissan, have come to an end. This termination poses a threat to Fisker's near-term rescue funding efforts. In a regulatory filing on Monday, Fisker disclosed that the automaker terminated the negotiations on March 22. However, Fisker had to continue the negotiations as part of the closing conditions for a potential $150 million convertible note announced the previous week. To address this situation, Fisker intends to request that the unnamed investor waive the closing condition.

Following this announcement, Fisker's stock plummeted by 28%, resulting in a halt in trading. This development adds to the growing list of challenges faced by the beleaguered EV startup. Fisker has struggled to meet its sales targets for its Ocean SUV, prompting a shift away from a direct sales model. Furthermore, the company has been grappling with quality issues affecting some of the delivered cars, which it has had difficulty resolving.

In an effort to navigate these difficulties, Fisker laid off approximately 200 employees (15% of its workforce) in February. As of last week, the company reported having only $121 million in its bank account. Fisker has paused production and issued a warning to investors that it would not survive another year without a substantial cash infusion. While Fisker engaged in discussions with other automakers, such as Mazda, it appears that only Nissan remained actively involved in negotiations.

Fisker stated on Monday that it is exploring alternative options for a strategic partnership, including potential tie-ups with other companies. These alternatives could involve in or out of court restructurings, capital market transactions, debt refinancing, equity issuances, asset or business sales, or other strategic measures. Fisker's focus now shifts to finding a new path forward after the termination of negotiations with the unnamed automaker.

This setback raises questions about the future of Fisker and its ability to secure the necessary funding to continue operations. The company's financial situation is precarious, and without a fresh injection of cash, it faces an uncertain future. Fisker's management team and stakeholders must now evaluate their options and make strategic decisions to ensure the survival and success of the company.

In conclusion, the termination of negotiations between Fisker and a large automaker has placed the EV startup's near-term rescue funding at risk. Fisker now faces the challenge of finding alternative solutions to secure the necessary capital. The company's stock has already taken a hit, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding its future. As Fisker evaluates other strategic options, it remains to be seen how the company will navigate these challenging circumstances and forge a new path forward.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1236611991.jpg?resize=1200,759",2024-03-25 13:52:11,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/03/25/3-motivations-behind-cosplaying-according-to-a-psychologist/,"3 Motivations Behind ‘Cosplaying,’ According To A Psychologist","Cosplay: The Art of Becoming Someone Else

If you’ve ever dressed up for Halloween, you might have gotten a taste of the excitement of portraying a famous character, if only for a single night. However, there are individuals who take it a step further and make cosplay a lifestyle. Cosplay, short for ""costume play,"" is a vibrant subculture where people wear elaborate costumes and embody fictional personas on a regular basis. It's more than just a once-a-year event - it's a passion and art form.

While cosplaying, individuals dress up as characters from various forms of media, such as comic books, anime, manga, video games, movies, and television shows. It's an opportunity for cosplayers to immerse themselves in the worlds of their favorite franchises. From Superman and Batman to Harley Quinn and the Joker, the choices are endless. Characters from Disney, the Harry Potter universe, and Star Wars, like Darth Vader, Princess Leia, and Luke Skywalker, are also popular among cosplayers.

Anime and manga provide a rich source of material for cosplayers as well. Characters like Naruto Uzumaki from ""Naruto,"" Goku from ""Dragon Ball Z,"" Sailor Moon from ""Sailor Moon,"" and Luffy from ""One Piece"" are frequently seen at cosplay events.

Cosplayers go to great lengths to recreate the costumes, hairstyles, makeup, and accessories of their chosen characters, aiming for accuracy and authenticity. But it's not just about the appearance. Cosplaying also involves embodying the personality, mannerisms, and unique traits of the character being portrayed.

Now, let's explore three reasons why people cosplay, based on research.

1. Creative Self-Expression

Research has shown that authentic self-expression is associated with greater life satisfaction. Cosplaying provides an outlet for creative expression, allowing individuals to celebrate their favorite fandoms and express their passion for fictional characters and stories.

Many cosplayers see cosplay as a way to explore different facets of their identity. By embodying different characters, they can experiment with various personas and aspects of themselves that they may not feel comfortable expressing in their everyday lives.

A study published in the journal Fashion Theory in 2015 examined the cosplay subculture in Hong Kong and found that the ability to shift identities plays a crucial role in pursuing cosplay. It allows enthusiasts to momentarily change their identity and create an exciting, extraordinary, and contented self.

For some cosplayers, it's also a way to recapture a sense of childhood innocence and nostalgia. As one cosplayer interviewed by the researchers said, ""Being a cosplayer, I can transform myself into many different characters - a heroine, a cute little girl, or even a beautiful boy. I'm no longer a passive reader or video game player. I'm a producer and performer.""

Cosplaying can be an empowering activity that boosts confidence by allowing individuals to choose their identity and take on new roles, regardless of societal expectations.

2. Escaping Reality

In a world filled with stress and uncertainty, stepping into the shoes of a beloved character offers a temporary reprieve from reality. Cosplayers transcend the confines of their everyday lives and appreciate the chance to be anyone or anything they desire.

A study conducted in 2018 found that one of the strongest motivations for engaging in cosplay is the desire to escape from everyday life. By immersing themselves in their favorite fantastical worlds, cosplayers can experience a sense of adventure, excitement, wonder, and popularity that may be lacking in their otherwise mundane routines.

Cosplay provides young people with dreams, pleasures, romances, and fantasies that cannot be fulfilled in their daily lives. For a brief moment, cosplaying can make participants feel like stars or celebrities. Many cosplayers admit that it's not just a hobby they love, but also an outlet for performance and exhibition. They want to be recognized, photographed, and admired.

3. A Sense of Community

Apart from the ability to escape reality, ""belongingness"" is one of the strongest motivations behind cosplaying, according to researchers. Cosplay fosters a sense of community among like-minded individuals and fulfills the fundamental human need to belong.

Conventions and gatherings serve as communal spaces where cosplayers can come together to share their passion and forge lasting friendships. It's a place where they can connect with others who understand their love for cosplay and appreciate the effort they put into their costumes.

Cosplay communities provide support, encouragement, and a sense of belonging that can be difficult to find elsewhere. It's a space where individuals can be themselves without judgment, surrounded by people who share their interests and enthusiasm.

In conclusion, cosplay is more than just dressing up as a character. It's an art form that allows individuals to express their creativity, escape from reality, and find a sense of community. By becoming someone else, even for a brief moment, cosplayers can explore different facets of their identity and experience a world of imagination and wonder. So, the next time you see a cosplayer, remember that they are not just wearing a costume - they are embracing their passion and becoming the best version of themselves.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6601ac3a0b7231e5ced958f7/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2613,1224,x0,y80,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 19:30:41,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/match-board-directors-after-talks-activist-investor-elliott-management/,Match appoints two board directors after talks with activist investor Elliott Management,"Tinder-owner Match Group has made some significant moves recently, with the appointment of two new board members and a new agreement with activist investor Elliott Management. Laura Jones, the Chief Marketing Officer at Instacart, and Spencer Rascoff, co-founder of Zillow, have joined the board, effective immediately.

According to Match, these appointments are a result of a ""constructive dialogue"" with Elliott Management, with both companies entering into an ""information-sharing"" agreement. This announcement comes several months after it was reported that Elliott had acquired a stake of around $1 billion in Match Group. The Wall Street Journal suggested that Elliott was interested in discussing strategies to improve Match's performance, as the company has been experiencing a decline in paying users amidst economic uncertainty.

Marc Steinberg, a partner at Elliott, expressed confidence in Match Group's potential for value creation as the global leader in online dating. He stated, ""We appreciate the collaboration with management and the Board over the past several months, and we are confident that Laura Jones and Spencer Rascoff are strong additions to the Board. We believe their unique skills and perspectives will help support the Company through its next phase of growth."" Elliott Management has a history of acquiring stakes in tech companies and pushing for changes, as seen with their involvement in Crown Castle and Etsy.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, Match Group's total paid users decreased by 5% compared to the previous year, totaling 15.2 million. The company's growth has slowed down from the highs it experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a 79% decline in stock from its peak in 2021.

Match Group is the parent company of various popular dating apps, including Tinder, Hinge, Match.com, Meetic, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, OurTime, and more.

This recent development showcases Match Group's commitment to revitalizing its business and addressing the challenges it faces. With the addition of Laura Jones and Spencer Rascoff to its board, the company gains fresh perspectives and expertise that can contribute to its future growth. It will be interesting to see how these changes impact Match's performance and if they can regain their momentum in the online dating industry.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1241790742.jpeg?w=1024,2024-03-25 14:15:04,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/london-regtech-gss-raises-47m-to-help-banks-screen-for-global-sanctions/,London regtech GSS raises $47M to help banks screen for global sanctions,"Global Screening Services (GSS), a London-based regulatory compliance platform, has successfully raised $47 million in funding. The company specializes in helping financial institutions meet their global sanctions obligations, a particularly important task given the recent increase in economic sanctions. The United States, for example, has issued trade restrictions and asset blocking against countries such as Russia, China, and Iran.

GSS was founded by Tom Scampion, who previously served as the head of financial crime for Deloitte's EMEA arm. In 2020, Scampion became a general partner at consulting firm AlixPartner, where GSS was initially incubated before becoming an independent entity in 2021. Last year, the company raised a similar amount of funding from renowned investors like Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), one of the world's largest banks. In its latest funding round, GSS secured backing from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), Cynosure Group, and AlixPartner.

Financial institutions, including banks, often find themselves at the forefront of sanctions enforcement due to their role in managing global money flows. However, identifying the parties involved in financial transactions can be challenging. In 2019, Standard Chartered faced fines totaling $1.1 billion from regulators in the UK and the US for inadequate money-laundering controls and breaching sanctions against countries like Iran. Similarly, BNP Paribas was fined a staggering $8.9 billion in 2014 for processing financial transactions for US-sanctioned countries.

Given the significance of regulatory compliance in the financial industry, investors have increasingly supported businesses specializing in this area. For instance, Droit, based in New York, raised $23 million in funding last year, while London's SteelEye secured $21 million in financing.

GSS offers a sanctions-screening platform designed to assist banks and other financial institutions in complying with regulations. Users input transaction data into GSS's cloud-based platform, which then compares it against a comprehensive set of sanctions lists from around the world. If a match is found, the platform generates an alert. GSS also enriches these lists with additional data, such as dates of birth, International Maritime Organization (IMO) numbers for ships, and information from the local financial transfer systems of sanctioned countries like Russia and China. The company also provides enhanced lists for screening, including companies that have partial ownership by sanctioned entities identified by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the European Union (EU), or the United Kingdom (UK).

With the latest funding round, GSS is now transitioning from its development phase to becoming fully operational. The company is preparing to go live with its first customers, marking an important milestone in its journey.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1770041999-e1711386339681.jpg?resize=1200,677",2024-03-25 18:36:37,Innovation,Innovation
