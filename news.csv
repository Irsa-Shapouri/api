https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-co8322-sustainable-fuel.html,Research lights up process for turning CO₂ into sustainable fuel,"Researchers have made a groundbreaking discovery by successfully converting CO2 into methanol using sunlight and copper atoms deposited on a light-activated material. This achievement opens up new possibilities for the development of green fuels. A team of international researchers from the University of Nottingham's School of Chemistry, University of Birmingham, University of Queensland, and University of Ulm developed a material consisting of copper anchored on nanocrystalline carbon nitride. The copper atoms are embedded within the nanocrystalline structure, allowing for the transfer of electrons from carbon nitride to CO2. This transfer is a crucial step in the production of methanol from CO2 under the influence of solar irradiation. The research, published in the Sustainable Energy & Fuels journal, demonstrates the potential of this innovative method.

Photocatalysis is the process of using light to excite electrons in a semiconductor material, enabling them to react with CO2 and water to produce various useful products, including methanol. However, this process has faced challenges in terms of efficiency and selectivity. Carbon dioxide is a major contributor to global warming, and while it is possible to convert CO2 into useful products, traditional thermal methods rely on hydrogen obtained from fossil fuels. Therefore, it is crucial to develop alternative methods that utilize solar energy and water through photo- and electrocatalysis.

Dr. Madasamy Thangamuthu, a research fellow in the School of Chemistry at the University of Nottingham and co-leader of the research team, emphasized the importance of selecting the right materials for photocatalysis. The material should efficiently absorb light and facilitate effective charge separation. The team's approach involves controlling the material at the nanoscale, utilizing a new form of carbon nitride with crystalline nanoscale domains that enable efficient interaction with light and sufficient charge separation.

To enhance the functional properties of carbon nitride for photocatalysis, the researchers developed a process of heating the material to achieve the desired degree of crystallinity. They then deposited atomic copper using magnetron sputtering, which allowed for intimate contact between the semiconductor and metal atoms. The team measured the current generated by light and used it as a criterion to evaluate the quality of the catalyst. Surprisingly, the addition of just 1 mg of copper per 1 g of carbon nitride significantly increased the catalyst's efficiency. Without copper, the new form of carbon nitride was already 44 times more active than traditional carbon nitride. With the addition of copper, the selectivity shifted from methane to methanol, making it a valuable green fuel.

Professor Andrei Khlobystov, also from the School of Chemistry at the University of Nottingham, emphasized the importance of sustainable catalyst materials for carbon dioxide valorization. The new catalyst consists of carbon, nitrogen, and copper, which are all abundantly available on Earth. This sustainable composition aligns with the goal of achieving net-zero emissions.

This invention represents a significant advancement in the field of photocatalytic CO2 conversion. It provides insights into the development of highly selective and tunable catalysts by controlling the catalyst at the nanoscale. By dialing up the desired product, this discovery offers a pathway towards efficient CO2 conversion and the production of green fuels.

In conclusion, researchers have successfully transformed CO2 into methanol using sunlight and copper atoms deposited on a light-activated material. This breakthrough paves the way for the development of new green fuels. By optimizing the properties of carbon nitride and introducing copper as a catalyst, the team achieved increased efficiency and selectivity in the conversion process. This discovery holds immense potential for combating global warming and achieving sustainability goals. As further research is conducted, we can expect further advancements in the field of photocatalytic CO2 conversion, bringing us closer to a cleaner and greener future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/research-lights-up-pro.jpg,2024-03-25 20:10:01,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.zdnet.com/article/saving-hours-of-work-with-ai-how-chatgpt-became-my-virtual-assistant-for-a-data-project/,Saving hours of work with AI: How ChatGPT became my virtual assistant for a data project,"Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has gained a lot of attention recently, with tools like ChatGPT being touted as game-changers. While it's easy to get caught up in the hype, it's important to remember that these tools are just that – tools. However, they can be incredibly useful for certain projects, as I discovered when ChatGPT saved me hours of work on a recent assignment. Today, I'll walk you through that project and share my thought process for using ChatGPT, in the hopes that it inspires you to leverage AI in your own work.

The project I was working on was what I like to call a ""stunt article."" These are fun projects that I know readers will be interested in. In this particular article, I wanted to see how much computer gear I could buy from Temu for under $100. I managed to come in at $99.77, which was quite a feat.

Putting together this article involved scouring the Temu website for items to feature. For example, I found an iPad keyboard and mouse combo that cost just $6. To stay within my budget, I needed to compile a list of all the Temu links, find the price of each item, and rearrange things until I reached my desired total.

The challenge was converting the Temu links into something usable. That's where ChatGPT came in. Here's how I used it in four phases:

Phase 1: Gathering the links
I started by collecting all the links and pasting them into a Notion page. Notion allows you to create bookmark blocks that not only contain links but also include the product names. Once I had all the blocks selected, I copied them and pasted them into a text editor.

Phase 2: Identifying the data
Each block of data had three key elements: the product name, the base URL, and some unnecessary tracking data. I needed to extract the product name and the URL, while getting rid of the extra tracking information. To make this easier, I used delimiters to highlight the relevant parts of the data.

Phase 3: Teaching ChatGPT to recognize the data
I fed ChatGPT a prompt instructing it to accept the data and await further instructions. Then, I pasted all the information from the text editor into ChatGPT. At this point, ChatGPT knew to wait for more details. The crucial step came next – I wanted ChatGPT to extract the titles and URLs while ignoring the rest of the data. I provided a prompt that explained this process and tested whether ChatGPT understood the assignment.

ChatGPT performed the assignment correctly, but it stopped about two-thirds of the way through due to its buffer limit. I instructed it to continue, and it provided the remaining data. This saved me a significant amount of time compared to doing it manually.

Phase 4: Cleaning up Temu's titles
Temu's product titles were overly complex for my project. I wanted simpler versions that conveyed the same information. For example, instead of ""10 Inch LCD Writing Tablet, Electronis Memo With Leather Protective Case, Electronic Drawing Board For Digital Handwriting Pad Doodle Board, Gifts For,"" I preferred ""LCD writing tablet with case."" I assigned this task to ChatGPT as well, reminding it that it had already parsed and identified the data. I find that reinforcing previous steps helps ChatGPT incorporate the instructions more reliably.

By leveraging ChatGPT, I was able to streamline the process of gathering and organizing the Temu links, as well as simplify the product titles. It saved me valuable time and effort, making the project much more manageable.

While this specific project may not be relevant to your work, I hope it demonstrates how ChatGPT can be a valuable tool for various tasks. Whether it's data extraction, content generation, or other projects, AI can be a powerful ally in boosting productivity and efficiency.

Remember, though, that AI tools are just tools. They require human guidance and oversight to ensure accuracy and quality. So, don't hesitate to explore the possibilities of AI in your work, but always exercise your expertise and judgment to maintain the integrity of your projects.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/70d8814af33b190ff84b8faa5f9bafe13d3586e2/2024/03/25/7d1cb1ff-3bb7-4972-a6cd-33d04da76bc1/cover.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/boeing-ceo-to-leave-company-by-year-end-after-a-wave-of-safety-incidents/,Boeing CEO to leave company by year-end after a wave of safety incidents,"Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun is set to step down from his position by the end of 2024, following a series of safety incidents that have plagued the company.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/large-language-models-can-help-home-robots-recover-from-errors-without-human-help/,Large language models can help home robots recover from errors without human help,"Home robots have struggled to gain widespread success for several reasons, including pricing, practicality, form factor, and mapping. But even when these issues are addressed, there is still the challenge of what happens when a robot makes a mistake. This challenge is not limited to consumer-level robots; it is also a point of friction in the industrial sector. However, large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution to this problem, as demonstrated by recent research from MIT.

A study presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) introduces a method of integrating ""common sense"" into the process of correcting robot mistakes. The researchers found that robots are excellent mimics, but without specific programming to handle unexpected situations, they struggle to adapt and continue their tasks. Traditionally, when a robot encounters issues, it exhausts its pre-programmed options before requiring human intervention. This is particularly challenging in unstructured environments like homes, where changes in the environment can disrupt a robot's ability to function.

The study addresses this challenge by utilizing imitation learning, which involves learning to perform a task through observation. However, traditional imitation learning cannot account for the countless small variations in the environment that can interfere with a robot's operation. To overcome this, the researchers break demonstrations into smaller subsets, treating them as individual actions rather than continuous sequences.

This is where LLMs come into play, eliminating the need for manual labeling and assignment of subactions by the programmer. LLMs can provide instructions for each step of a task in natural language, while a human's continuous demonstration represents those steps in physical space. The goal is to connect the two, allowing the robot to automatically recognize its current stage in a task and replan and recover on its own.

In the study, the researchers trained a robot to scoop marbles and pour them into a bowl. While this may seem like a simple task for humans, it involves various small tasks for robots. The LLMs can list and label these subtasks. During the demonstrations, the researchers intentionally sabotaged the activity by bumping the robot off course and knocking marbles out of its spoon. Instead of starting from scratch, the system self-corrected the small tasks to continue the overall task.

By utilizing this method, there is no need to rely on humans to program or provide extra demonstrations for recovering from failures. The robot can autonomously identify and correct mistakes, reducing the need for human intervention.

Overall, this research offers a compelling approach to address the challenges faced by home robots. It leverages LLMs to enable robots to adapt and recover from mistakes, ultimately improving their functionality in unstructured environments. With further development, this method could pave the way for more capable and reliable home robots that can handle unexpected situations without the need for constant human supervision. So, the next time a robot makes a mistake, it won't lose its marbles.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/CommonSense-01-press_0.jpg?w=900,2024-03-25 20:01:06,Innovation,Innovation

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-strategy-suppress-strain-propagation-ultrahigh.html,A strategy to suppress strain propagation in ultrahigh-Ni cathodes during fast charging,"To support the growing demand for the electronics industry and electric vehicles, researchers are continuously working on developing advanced battery technologies. One promising approach is the use of nickel-rich layered oxides as cathode materials in lithium-ion batteries (LiBs). These cathodes offer various advantages such as increased battery capacity, improved rate capabilities, and reduced fabrication costs. However, they also have limitations, including capacity degradation and structural instability during fast-charging and long-term cycling.

To address these challenges, researchers from Argonne National Laboratory and other institutes worldwide have proposed a new strategy to enhance the structural stability and reliability of ultrahigh-Ni cathodes. Their approach, outlined in a recent paper published in Nature Energy, involves the use of epitaxial entropy-assisted oxide coating to suppress strain propagation, which is a major cause of cathode failure during fast charging and cycling.

The team, led by Chen Zhao and Chuanwei Wang, designed a specialized oxide coating that aligns with the structure of Ni-rich cathodes. These coatings not only improve the robustness of the cathode surface but also enhance ionic conductivity, enabling faster charging of batteries. The coating is based on Wadsley-Roth crystallographic shear phases, which have been found to enhance electrode performance in LiBs. Importantly, these compounds adhere well to Ni-rich cathodes, strengthening their structural stability during operation and fast charging.

The researchers conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of their coating strategy. They coated Ni-rich layered cathodes and tested their performance over time and under various conditions. The results were highly promising, as the coatings significantly reduced damage to the cathodes, even during fast charging and after multiple operation cycles.

The epitaxial entropy-assisted coating strategy offers several benefits for LiBs. It improves the fast charging/discharging capability, widens the temperature tolerance, enhances thermal stability, and increases the overall structural stability of the ultrahigh-Ni cathodes. The researchers conducted comprehensive analyses at different scales, from the primary and secondary particle level to the electrode level, using in situ synchrotron X-ray probes. These analyses revealed reduced lattice dislocations, anisotropic lattice strain, oxygen release, and improved bulk/local structural stability, even when charging beyond the threshold state of charge (75%) of layered cathodes.

The findings of this study indicate that the epitaxial entropy-assisted coating strategy has great potential for surface engineering in the design and development of high-energy and high-power LiBs. By addressing the challenges of capacity degradation and structural instability, this coating strategy could pave the way for the next generation of advanced batteries.

In conclusion, researchers have developed a novel approach to enhance the structural stability and reliability of nickel-rich cathodes in LiBs. The epitaxial entropy-assisted oxide coating strategy effectively suppresses strain propagation, reducing damage to the cathodes during fast charging and prolonged cycling. This coating improves the fast charging/discharging capability, widens the temperature tolerance, enhances thermal stability, and increases the overall structural stability of the ultrahigh-Ni cathodes. The promising results of this study open up exciting opportunities for the design and development of high-energy and high-power LiBs in the future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/a-strategy-to-suppress.jpg,2024-03-25 09:40:01,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/maju-kuruvilla-is-out-as-ceo-of-one-click-checkout-company-bolt/,Maju Kuruvilla is out as CEO of one-click checkout company Bolt,"Maju Kuruvilla has stepped down as the CEO of Bolt, the one-click checkout company. He has been replaced by Justin Grooms, the global head of sales at Bolt, who will serve as the interim CEO. This information was confirmed by Grooms on his LinkedIn profile. Kuruvilla also acknowledged the change on LinkedIn and X, with a brief post stating, ""One-Click Checkedout from @bolt! Onwards"" accompanied by a rocket emoji. However, he did not provide any further comments on the matter. Arjun Sethi, a co-founder of Tribe Capital, commented on Kuruvilla's post, expressing his appreciation for working with him.

According to The Information, the Bolt board made the decision to remove Kuruvilla over the weekend. Kuruvilla, a former executive at Amazon, assumed the role of CEO in January 2022 after the founder, Ryan Breslow, stepped down.

Grooms has been with Bolt for five years and has held executive positions at various companies including Ultraleap (formerly Leap Motion), Datron World Communications, and Qualcomm, as stated on his LinkedIn profile. The company informed The Information that the CEO role had changed and described Kuruvilla's departure as ""amicable,"" without providing further details.

Bolt has had its fair share of controversy in the past. Breslow, who founded the company at the age of 27 after dropping out of Stanford, was known for his outspoken rants. In an interview with TechCrunch, he mentioned that Bolt had signed significant deals in the second half of 2021, surpassing any previous deals in the company's history.

However, Bolt faced challenges along the way. The company was investigated by federal authorities regarding potential securities law violations during its 2021 fundraising efforts, when it sought a Series E round worth $355 million, valuing the company at $11 billion. Bolt raised a total of around $1 billion in venture-backed funding.

The company also experienced several rounds of layoffs, including one in May 2022, where approximately one-third of its workforce, or 185 employees, were let go. Additional layoffs occurred in early 2023 and December 2023, affecting 29% of the staff.

In October, Kuruvilla, as the CEO at the time, stated that the SEC was no longer investigating Bolt. He also mentioned that the company was working towards profitability and had plans to introduce new features, such as improving merchandise returns and providing personalized experiences through its universal shopper network. Bolt announced partnerships with retailers like Saks OFF 5TH, Shinola, Filson, Lafayette 148, and Toys ""R"" Us in November.

Recently, Bolt entered into a deal with Checkout.com, becoming Checkout.com's exclusive one-click checkout provider, while Checkout.com became Bolt's preferred payment partner.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-method-quantum-mechanics-lithium-metal.html,New method that uses quantum mechanics can lead to improved lithium metal batteries,"In a recent study published in Nature Energy, Dr. Perla Balbuena and Dr. Jorge Seminario, professors in the Artie McFerrin Department of Chemical Engineering at Texas A&M University, have developed a groundbreaking method to understand the impact of external pressure on lithium-metal batteries using quantum mechanics. This research has the potential to revolutionize the fabrication of lithium-metal batteries, leading to longer-lasting and more efficient battery technologies.

Lithium-ion batteries have transformed the world of mobile electronics, enabling the development of compact devices that can easily fit in our pockets. However, these batteries still face several challenges, with one of the most significant being their energy density, which is limited by the battery components.

According to Dr. Seminario, lithium-ion batteries function by utilizing two crucial electrodes to convert lithium ions into neutral species, storing their energy as chemical energy. These neutral species can then be transformed back into ions, facilitating the transport of their energy as electrical energy.

The anode, or the negative electrode, is where the lithium ions possess maximum energy. On the other hand, the cathode, or the positive electrode, has the lowest energy level for the lithium ions. This inherent difference in energy levels explains why lithium ions naturally migrate from the anode to the cathode during discharge, allowing electrons to follow suit externally and power the intended device.

To overcome the limitations of current lithium-ion batteries, researchers have been exploring alternative materials, such as replacing the conventional graphite anode with lithium metal. Theoretically, this substitution could enhance the energy density of the anode by a factor of ten.

However, lithium metal is highly reactive, requiring innovative control measures, including the application of external pressure to the battery. While external pressure has been known to significantly impact cell performance, there is currently a lack of research exploring the relationship between external pressure and the electroplating of lithium in large-format pouch cells to enhance overall battery performance.

Additionally, when the battery undergoes assembly and cycling, its components may experience volume changes, leading to cell swelling and affecting battery performance and cycle life.

To address these challenges, the team from Texas A&M University focused on understanding why pressure can help achieve a more uniform distribution of lithium ions on the anode, thus preventing the formation of dendrites that could potentially short-circuit the battery. By employing theoretical-computational techniques, they meticulously analyzed the effects of pressure on lithium-metal anodes.

Using quantum mechanical analysis, the researchers evaluated the trajectories of lithium ions migrating from the cathode to the anode. They found that the lithium ions tend to detour toward regions with elevated pressure or a higher concentration of lithium atoms on the surface. This behavior is a result of the electric field generated by the lithium-metal anode.

This groundbreaking discovery allows researchers to predict the behavior of novel materials proposed as components for cutting-edge applications. By understanding the trajectories of ions in these conditions, lithium-metal batteries can be developed with less expensive infrastructure and fabrication processes, resulting in longer battery life and increased functionality.

The implications of this research extend beyond the field of battery technology. Dr. Balbuena emphasizes that similar methods can be applied to improve chemical and physical processes across various fields, including chemical engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, materials science, and biology.

The research conducted by Dr. Balbuena and Dr. Seminario is part of the ongoing work under the Battery500 Consortium. This consortium is a collaboration between national labs and academia, led by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, with the goal of developing more reliable and high-performing vehicle batteries. The efforts of this consortium align with the Department of Energy's objectives to advance battery technologies.

In conclusion, the study conducted by the team at Texas A&M University sheds light on the impact of external pressure on lithium-metal batteries. By understanding the behavior of lithium ions under pressure, researchers can improve the fabrication processes of lithium-metal batteries, leading to advancements in energy density, battery life, and overall battery performance. This research has the potential to pave the way for the widespread use of lithium-metal batteries in various applications, benefiting industries and consumers alike.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/new-discovery-can-lead.jpg,2024-03-25 17:06:08,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/25/google-update-warning-chrome-windows-11-android-iphone/,Google’s New AI Search Goes Horribly Wrong-M Is For Malware,"Google recently launched its new Search Generative Experience (SGE), an AI-powered search system designed to transform traditional search results. However, the initial release of SGE has been plagued with issues, as it recommended scam sites and dangerous malware to users. One SEO consultant discovered these scams, which included fake iPhone giveaways, tech support scams, and unwanted Chrome extensions. The problem with generative AI is that these dangers are disguised in friendly and chatty language, making it difficult for users to identify them. 

Many of the fraudulent redirects aimed to obtain personal information or redirect users to unwanted subscriptions for commission payments. Some links were even more dangerous, hijacking search results and engaging in potentially malicious behavior. Google acknowledged the issue and stated that they are continuously updating their advanced spam-fighting systems to combat this problem. They have also taken action to remove the examples shared by users. However, it's important to note that these examples were from opt-in Search Labs users, and not the general user base.

Despite these initial challenges, AI search is undoubtedly the future. However, it serves as a reminder for users to exercise caution when exploring new technologies and to remember the basic rules of safe searching. As AI search becomes more integrated into generative AI chatbots, the potential for exploitation and new tricks targeting unsuspecting users will only increase. Before that happens, it is crucial to improve the filters and defenses to ensure user safety.

In conclusion, while Google's SGE has experienced some setbacks with the recommendation of scams and malware, it represents a significant step towards the future of search. As with any emerging technology, there are bound to be challenges and risks. However, with continuous improvements and a vigilant approach to user safety, AI search has the potential to revolutionize the way we find information online.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6602155031526c87ed877205/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3115,2027,x1040,y734,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 21:15:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/london-regtech-gss-raises-47m-to-help-banks-screen-for-global-sanctions/,London regtech GSS raises $47M to help banks screen for global sanctions,"Global Screening Services (GSS), a London-based regulatory compliance platform, has recently secured a funding round of $47 million. This comes at a time when economic sanctions have seen a significant rise, with the United States imposing trade restrictions and asset blocking against countries like Russia, China, and Iran. GSS aims to assist financial institutions in meeting their global sanctions obligations.

The CEO of GSS, Tom Scampion, who was previously the head of financial crime for Deloitte's EMEA arm, left the company in 2020 to become a general partner at consulting firm AlixPartners. GSS was initially incubated within AlixPartners before being spun out as a separate entity in 2021. Last year, GSS raised a similar amount of funding from prominent investors, including Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), one of the world's largest banks. In their latest funding round, GSS has added another financial powerhouse as a backer: the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), along with Cynosure Group and AlixPartners.

Financial institutions often find themselves at the forefront of sanctions enforcement due to their role in controlling global money flow. However, determining who is sending money to whom can be challenging. Standard Chartered, for example, faced $1.1 billion in fines from regulators in the UK and the US in 2019 for inadequate money-laundering controls, including violations of sanctions against countries like Iran. Similarly, BNP Paribas was fined a staggering $8.9 billion five years prior for processing financial transactions for US-sanctioned countries.

Given these challenges, investors have shown continued support for regulatory compliance businesses in recent years. Companies like Droit, based in New York, raised $23 million last year, while London's SteelEye secured $21 million in financing.

GSS offers a sanctions-screening platform that helps banks and other financial institutions comply with regulations. These institutions input transaction data into GSS's cloud-based platform, which then alerts them if a match is found against a standardized set of sanctions lists from around the world. GSS also enhances these lists with additional data points, such as dates of birth, International Maritime Organization (IMO) numbers for ships, and data from the local financial transfer systems of sanctioned countries.

Moreover, GSS provides ""enhanced"" lists for screening purposes, including companies that are partially owned by individuals, companies, or governments that have been sanctioned by regulatory bodies like the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the European Union (EU), or the United Kingdom (UK).

With the recent injection of $47 million in funding, GSS is now transitioning from the development phase to becoming fully operational. The company is preparing to go live with its first customers, marking an important milestone in its journey.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1770041999-e1711386339681.jpg?resize=1200,677",2024-03-25 18:36:37,Innovation,Innovation

March is coming to an end, and what a peculiar month it has been. Winter has been reluctant to leave, overpowering the new beginnings of spring. Although the sun is shining today and the snow is melting, the forecast predicts more snow for Easter weekend. And let's not forget that the day after Easter is April Fool's Day, a day that I personally dread. It's best to avoid spending too much time online on that particular day.

Interestingly enough, it was on April Fool's Day when I managed to solve not just one, but two Wordles with a single guess. I thought to myself, if I were to play a Wordle-style prank on April Fool's Day, I would pick the only other month with five letters that is not just a proper noun. (April, being a proper noun, cannot be the answer to a Wordle puzzle).

Now, speaking of proper nouns, yesterday's Wordle had me completely stumped!

But let's get down to business. It's Wordle time!

Here's How to Solve Today's Wordle:

Hint: Politician
Clue: The last letter of today's Wordle is a consonant.

And now, for the answer:

Analyzing the Wordle:
Every day, I eagerly check Wordle Bot to see how well I did. You can also check your Wordles with Wordle Bot right here.

I was so confident on my third guess, only to have my hopes dashed when the third box turned gray. Oh well, c'est la vie! My initial guess was somewhat accurate but not quite there. I had 196 words remaining and only one lonely yellow 'O'. However, Crane gave me a lifeline by reducing my options to 11 and granting me two more yellow squares to work with. I pondered over the possibilities and settled on ""major"" since it was one of the few words I could think of that contained the letter 'M'. Unfortunately, it turned out to be ""mayor"" and not ""major"" that was the correct answer for today's Wordle.

Competitive Wordle Score:
I lose 1 point because the Bot solved it in just three guesses (crane / tyros / mayor - tyros? Really?), and I receive 0 points for guessing it in four tries. So, a total score of -1. Sigh.

The Etymology of Today's Wordle:
The word ""mayor"" originated from the Old French term ""maire,"" which means ""head of a city or town government."" This French word derived from the Latin word ""maior,"" which translates to ""greater"" or ""superior."" In Latin, ""maior"" was used in the title ""maior domus"" or ""major domo,"" which referred to the ""chief steward"" of a noble house and denoted a position of authority and supervision. Over time, ""maior"" evolved into different forms in Romance languages, eventually leading to the English word ""mayor."" The role of a mayor as the leader of a city or municipal government reflects the historical sense of being a superior or chief official within a local jurisdiction.
