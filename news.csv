Previously, Grok was only available to Premium+ subscribers, but now it will be accessible to all Premium subscribers as well. This move could indicate a desire to compete with other popular chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude. It could also be an attempt to increase subscriber numbers, as recent data shows a decline in the usage of the platform. According to Sensor Tower, X usage in the U.S. has decreased by 18% since last year and 23% since Musk's acquisition. Additionally, 75 out of the top 100 U.S. advertisers on X in October 2022 no longer spend ad budget on the platform. By offering access to an AI chatbot like Grok, X hopes to retain its users and prevent them from migrating to other platforms such as Mastodon, Bluesky, or Instagram's Threads. These platforms have gained popularity, with Meta's resources allowing Threads to reach over 130 million monthly users as of the fourth quarter of 2023. While Musk did not specify the exact date when Grok will be available to X users, he mentioned that it would be enabled for all Premium subscribers sometime later this week. X Premium is the mid-tier subscription option, priced at $8 per month or $84 per year. Grok's chatbot is expected to appeal to Musk's followers and heavy X users as it can respond to questions about typically off-limits topics for other AI chatbots, such as conspiracies or controversial political ideas. It will also have a rebellious streak in its answers, according to Musk. One notable advantage of Grok is its ability to access real-time X data, something that its competitors cannot offer. However, the value of this data may be diminishing if X continues to lose users.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/xAI-Grok-GettyImages-1765893916.jpeg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-26 22:19:50,Innovation,Innovation
