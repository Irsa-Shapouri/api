https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikestubbs/2024/03/24/new-valorant-agent-clove-can-come-back-from-the-dead/,New ‘Valorant’ Agent Clove Can Come Back From The Dead,"Introducing Clove, the 25th agent in Valorant, who brings a unique set of abilities to the game. Recently revealed at the Valorant Masters Madrid tournament, Clove has already captured the attention of players with their ability to come back from the dead. As a controller, Clove excels at disrupting enemies and providing utility for their team, making them a valuable asset on the battlefield. Let's dive deeper into their abilities and explore how they can be utilized to turn the tides of the game.

First up, we have Clove's E ability called Ruse. Similar to Brimstone's smoke ability, Ruse allows Clove to create smoke screens that obstruct the enemy's line of sight. What sets Ruse apart is its additional feature – it can be used even when Clove is dead. By bringing up a small window displaying a top-down view of the map, players can strategically select where to deploy the smoke. This unique aspect adds an extra layer of versatility to Clove's kit, making them more than just a run-of-the-mill agent.

Next, we have Clove's Q ability, Meddle. This ability functions like a grenade, inflicting decay on any enemies caught within its blast radius. While it may seem less impactful compared to their other abilities, Meddle can still be a valuable tool when used correctly. However, players may find themselves forgetting to utilize it in the heat of battle, so mastering its usage will require practice and awareness.

Moving on to Clove's C ability, Pick-Me-Up. Similar to Reyna's kit, Pick-Me-Up allows Clove to absorb the life essence of fallen enemies, granting them haste and a temporary health buff. While this ability may not be the most exciting, it can provide Clove with the necessary edge to turn the tables in a close encounter. It's all about seizing the opportunity presented by fallen foes and using their essence to your advantage.

Now, let's talk about Clove's ultimate ability, the pièce de résistance. When Clove dies and their ultimate is ready, they have the ability to quickly cast it and come back to life for a short period. If, within this resurrection window, Clove manages to secure a kill or assist in damaging an enemy, they will be fully revived, as if they never died. However, if no kill or assist is achieved, Clove will return to the grave once the resurrection timer runs out. This ultimate ability adds an exhilarating twist to Clove's gameplay, encouraging players to take calculated risks and go for those game-changing plays.

It's worth noting that even in death, Clove can still contribute to the team's success. Whether it's through their ultimate resurrection or the deployment of smoke screens after dying, Clove's impact on the battlefield remains significant. This makes them an excellent choice for entry fraggers, as the risk of dying is mitigated by their unique abilities.

According to Dan Hardison, agent gameplay designer on Valorant, playing Clove optimally requires a willingness to take risks and trade one's life for the greater good. Removing enemy utility and securing kills are the keys to success with this agent. While Clove's raw execute utility may be weaker compared to other controllers, their ability to contribute even after death sets them apart. Hardison emphasizes the importance of fighting to the death rather than backing down from opponents. In fact, it's sometimes advantageous for Clove to sacrifice themselves for a non-Clove opponent, as long as they are traded by an ally. It's a high-risk, high-reward playstyle that demands a fearless approach to the game.

In conclusion, Clove brings an exciting and unique set of abilities to the world of Valorant. From their smoke screens to their life-absorbing capabilities, each ability serves a purpose in disrupting the enemy team and supporting their own. With the added twist of resurrection, Clove has the potential to turn the tide of a match with a well-timed kill or assist. So, if you're looking for an agent that rewards calculated risks and aggressive gameplay, Clove might just be the perfect choice for you. Get ready to embrace the fire and fight till the end with this captivating new addition to Valorant's roster.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff3fefa4d4cfc35a9fc1fe/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 11:15:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/marshallshepherd/2024/03/24/science-engagement-shapes-lives-and-changes-perceptions-too/,Science Engagement Shapes Lives And Changes Perceptions Too,"Science at Emory University. She and I were invited by the East Suburban Atlanta Chapter of Jack and Jill of America, Inc. to speak to a group of kids about our careers in STEM. The goal was to inspire and encourage these young minds to pursue their passions in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

As I stood in front of those bright-eyed students, I couldn't help but think about my own journey as a young Black boy with a love for science. Growing up as an only child raised by a single mother, I spent countless hours exploring nature, catching insects, and studying the weather. I may not have known it at the time, but those childhood interests were the seeds of my future career as an atmospheric scientist.

One defining moment for me was when I was stung by a bee and discovered that I had a severe allergy. That experience led me to shift my focus from entomology to weather, and I even did my sixth-grade science project on the subject. It was during this time that I became familiar with the work of Dr. George Washington Carver, an agricultural scientist who made groundbreaking discoveries at Tuskegee Institute. Despite never meeting him in person, Carver became my first mentor through the pages of books, inspiring me to ask questions and seek answers about the natural world.

Unfortunately, during my youth, there were not many Black kids pursuing careers in STEM. And even today, we still face challenges and barriers. A recent study by the Pew Center revealed that positive perceptions about STEM within the Black community are low. While professional athletes and musicians are celebrated, scientists and engineers rank much lower in terms of perceived success.

Lack of visible examples of Black achievement in STEM is one factor that deters many Black individuals from pursuing careers in these fields. Representation matters, and we need to increase the visibility of successful Black scientists, engineers, and mathematicians. We also need to provide vigorous and sustained mentorship to young aspiring scientists, guiding them on their paths and showing them what is possible.

But it's not just about inspiring and mentoring the next generation. We also need to address the systemic issues within academia and professional societies that make STEM fields feel unwelcoming for certain racial groups and women. As the former president of the American Meteorological Society, I have witnessed the lack of diversity firsthand. Black membership within the society is currently at only 2%, and there is still much work to be done to create a truly inclusive environment.

To build a stronger and more inclusive STEM ecosystem, we must focus on retention efforts. It's not enough to simply attract diverse individuals to these fields; we must also create an environment where they can thrive and feel welcomed. This means addressing biases, providing support networks, and valuing diverse perspectives. We must demonstrate that STEM research and development are better when all ideas are on the table.

The event this weekend was a small step towards creating a more inclusive STEM community. My colleague Dr. Pearl Dowe and I shared our personal journeys, our successes, and our challenges with those young students. We showed them that they too can pursue their passions in STEM, no matter their background. It was a reminder of the power of engagement and mentorship, and how they can shape lives and change perceptions.

As I reflect on this experience, I am reminded of the importance of representation, mentorship, and community in the world of STEM. We have made progress, but there is still much work to be done. Let us continue to inspire and empower the next generation of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians, and create a future where diversity and inclusion are the norm.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660034c3235190ae18aa9cf0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 11:18:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have more in common than you might think. Both companies saw their core businesses emerge from unexpected sources. AWS discovered that it could sell its internal services to external customers, while Nvidia realized that its gaming-focused GPU was well-suited for processing AI workloads. This realization led to explosive revenue growth for both companies.

Nvidia's revenue has been growing at triple digits, skyrocketing from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024 to $22.1 billion in Q4 2024. However, the majority of this growth came from the company's data center business. On the other hand, AWS has consistently been a major revenue driver for Amazon, but its growth has started to slow down. While Microsoft and Google have entered the market, creating the Big Three cloud vendors, other chip makers are also expected to gain market share in the coming years.

Both Nvidia and AWS were in the right place at the right time. As web apps and mobile usage increased, the cloud became a valuable resource for enterprises looking to move their workloads or build applications. Similarly, the rise of AI and large language models coincided with the increased use of GPUs for processing these workloads.

While AWS has become a highly successful business, currently on a run rate close to $100 billion, its growth has started to slow down. Nvidia, on the other hand, is experiencing rapid growth. The question is whether Nvidia can sustain this growth and become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS. If the GPU market tightens, Nvidia does have other businesses, but they are smaller revenue generators growing at a slower pace than the data center business.

In the short term, Nvidia's revenue growth has been astronomical. It anticipates $24 billion worth of revenue in its current quarter (Q1 FY25), a growth rate of around 234% compared to the previous year's first quarter. However, analysts expect Nvidia's growth rate to decline as it faces tougher year-over-year comparisons. Despite this, Nvidia is expected to continue scaling its revenue past the $100 billion annual run rate mark for the next several quarters.

Looking ahead, AI could be a continued source of growth for Nvidia, even as competition from AMD, Intel, and other chipmakers emerges. While Nvidia will face stiffer competition in the future, it currently controls a significant portion of the market. At the chip level, Nvidia is firmly in control, but AMD is gaining ground at the board level.

In conclusion, Nvidia and AWS have experienced impressive growth due to their timely entry into the market and their ability to meet the demands of emerging technologies. While AWS's growth has started to slow down, Nvidia is expected to continue scaling its revenue. With AI as a driving force, Nvidia has the potential to become a long-term revenue powerhouse, even as competition increases.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/technology/article/what-are-rpg-games/,What Is A Role-Playing Game? RPG Types Explained,"Role-playing games (RPGs) come in various forms and cater to different preferences. Some people enjoy the social aspect of tabletop RPGs, where friends gather to tell stories and roll dice. Others prefer RPG video games with interactive storylines and character customization. Whether you're a seasoned player or a newcomer looking to explore RPGs, this guide will help you discover the most common types of RPGs and find the perfect game for you.

What Are Role-Playing Games?
In RPGs, players assume the role of a character within a game that unfolds like a story. The choices made by players affect their character's development and the direction of the narrative. The story can be controlled by a computer or another player.

The traditional structure of RPGs involves players embodying a single character. They have the freedom to determine their character's appearance, behavior, and actions within the story. These characters remain part of the story until certain conditions are met, such as their death, removal by a game element, or the player's desire to switch to a different character.

In this setup, one player takes on the role of the Game Master (also known as Dungeon Master, Judge, Referee, Keeper, etc.). The Game Master ensures the story's progression, reacts to player actions, portrays supporting or antagonist characters, and resolves rule disputes. This role requires skill and dedication, making it a rewarding experience for players who enjoy being at the center of every game session.

Collaborative RPGs offer a different structure where everyone has equal control over the narrative. Game rules determine who controls the story at any given time. These games often aim to emulate specific genres or media formats like film or television.

Dungeons & Dragons, released in 1974, is widely recognized as the earliest and most influential tabletop RPG. While there may have been RPGs before it, Dungeons & Dragons captured the imagination of countless players and inspired numerous other games, including video games. RPGs on computers and game consoles emerged in the 1980s and have become increasingly sophisticated over the years.

Even today, Dungeons & Dragons remains the most popular tabletop RPG. Its recent adaptation into the video game Baldur's Gate 3 has garnered significant attention. However, there are various RPG genres to explore, each with its own strengths and devoted fanbase.

Types Of RPG Games
RPGs encompass a wide range of genres, often blurring the lines and incorporating different elements. Here are some of the most common RPG styles along with examples:

1. MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game)
MMORPGs are played online by thousands or even millions of people simultaneously. Players connect to a central server, create and develop their characters, and embark on missions. Some servers prioritize missions and character performance, while others encourage role-playing and staying in character at all times. World of Warcraft remains the most popular MMORPG, with other notable examples including Guild Wars 2, EVE Online, Star Wars The Old Republic, and Black Desert Online.

2. ARPG (Action Role-Playing Game)
Action RPGs place a strong emphasis on combat. Players must master fighting mechanics and equip their characters well to succeed. While many action RPGs focus on single-player battles, some also offer multiplayer components. The Diablo series is a prime example of this genre, along with Elder Ring, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Borderlands.

3. CRPG (Computer or Console Role-Playing Game)
CRPG encompasses any RPG played on a computer or video game console. These games typically offer a single-player, pre-scripted experience, guiding players through a specific storyline with limited exploration within dungeons or enclosed areas. Bioware games like Mass Effect and Dragon Age are popular examples of CRPGs, as well as titles like Planescape: Torment, Disco Elysium, and Shadowrun Returns.

4. JRPG (Japanese Role-Playing Game)
JRPGs originated on game consoles and often blend fantasy and science fiction genres. These games place a strong emphasis on party management and explore dramatic relationships within the context of saving the world. Popular JRPGs include the Final Fantasy series, Dragon Quest, Persona, and Tales of series.

Conclusion
Role-playing games offer a diverse and immersive gaming experience, catering to a wide range of interests and preferences. Whether you prefer the social dynamics of tabletop RPGs or the interactive storytelling of video games, there is an RPG genre suited to your taste. Take the time to explore different types of RPGs and find the game that captures your imagination and provides hours of enjoyment.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fb562b1ede4feb9fc02f0c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1795,1010,x0,y92,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 12:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/grrlscientist/2024/03/24/birding-under-the-influence-by-dorian-anderson---review/,Birding Under The Influence By Dorian Anderson - Review,"In the memoir ""Birding Under the Influence: Cycling Across America in Search of Birds and Recovery"" by Dorian Anderson, the author explores his journey of overcoming alcohol and drug addiction by immersing himself in birdwatching and bicycling across the USA. Anderson, a neuroscientist, leaves his high-powered research career behind after experiencing failure and decides to embark on a year-long quest to see as many bird species as possible, known as a Big Year, by cycling alone across the Lower 48 states.

The idea for a bicycling Big Year came to Anderson after a memorable eight-mile bike trip to Nantucket, Massachusetts, to see two Northern Lapwings. Despite his lack of experience with long-distance cycling, the idea stuck with him and became a reality. From the first day of 2014, when he departs from Boston, Anderson's physical journey is filled with dangers and challenges. He faces cycling through a polar vortex in Massachusetts, narrowly escaping accidents on the Cross Bronx Expressway in New York City, battling extreme winds, encountering hostile motorists and long-haul truckers, evading angry dogs, and dealing with numerous flat tires and biking mishaps. His route takes him from the northeast to Florida, across the Texas desert, over the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Northwest, and down to southern California. Throughout his journey, Anderson appreciates the diverse and breathtaking landscapes of America, such as the Florida Everglades, the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, and the Redwood forests of Oregon.

Long-distance cycling provides Anderson with ample time to reflect on his life choices and share his experiences in short vignettes interwoven throughout the narrative of his epic bike ride. Readers learn about his academic achievements, scientific research, alcohol and drug addictions that began in high school, and his four years of sobriety. As he pushes his physical and psychological limits, Anderson envisions a new future for himself, free from drugs and alcohol.

Writing a blog every night about his daily adventures on the road attracts the attention of a quirky group of birders across the country. Some of them offer him meals, a bed for a night or two, and share their hospitality, philosophies, and warm showers. Anderson's interactions with these birders provide insight into regional American subcultures.

Throughout his journey, Anderson bicycles every day for 12 months, covering 17,830 miles through 28 states. He walks at least 493 miles (though he suspects the actual distance may be three times greater) and kayaks eight miles in pursuit of both common and rare bird species. Along the way, he raises nearly $50,000 for bird habitat conservation. By the end of his Big Year, Anderson is in the best physical shape of his life, with a resting heart rate below 40 beats per minute.

In total, Anderson spots 618 bird species. On Thanksgiving Day, as his Big Year draws to a close, he documents a species that has never before been reported in the United States, a female/juvenile red-legged honeycreeper. After sharing this discovery online, local birders rush to Estero Llaño Grande State Park to witness this beautiful vagrant rarity.

While the book is generally well-written, closer editing could have tightened the prose and made the transitions between the adventure and self-reflection smoother and more logical. Nonetheless, Anderson demonstrates his dedication to turning his raw blog material into a narrative that explores his existential struggles, where he confronts his personal demons with unwavering honesty without losing the immediacy and wonder of his birding adventure.

One aspect that could have enhanced the book is the inclusion of maps detailing Anderson's journey. Maps would have allowed readers to better follow his adventure. Additionally, a final state-by-state summary of the bird species he encountered would have been a valuable addition.

Overall, ""Birding Under the Influence"" is an uplifting and hopeful memoir that combines a personal journey of overcoming addiction with a deep immersion in nature through birdwatching. Anderson's story serves as an inspiration for those seeking a path towards recovery and finding solace in the natural world.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff194d2ccb9152d392146c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=812,456,x0,y57,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 12:17:44,Innovation,Innovation
