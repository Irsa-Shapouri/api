https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-liquid-iron-battery-grid-energy.html,New all-liquid iron flow battery for grid energy storage,"A Safe and Economical Battery Design for Large-Scale Energy Storage

Researchers at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have developed a new battery design that repurposes a commonplace chemical used in water treatment facilities for large-scale energy storage. This innovative design offers a pathway to a safe, economical, and water-based flow battery that utilizes Earth-abundant materials. The battery design aims to address the challenge of incorporating intermittent energy sources like wind and solar energy into the nation's electric grid.

The researchers published their findings in Nature Communications, showcasing the remarkable cycling stability of their lab-scale, iron-based battery. Over one thousand consecutive charging cycles, the battery maintained 98.7% of its maximum capacity. In comparison, previous studies on similar iron-based batteries reported degradation of the charge capacity at a much higher rate over fewer charging cycles.

While iron-based flow batteries for large-scale energy storage have been around since the 1980s, this battery design stands out because it stores energy in a unique liquid chemical formula. This formula combines charged iron with a neutral-pH phosphate-based liquid electrolyte, or energy carrier. What makes this chemical formula special is that it is commercially available in industrial quantities. This is because the chemical, known as nitrogenous triphosphonate, nitrilotri-methylphosphonic acid or NTMPA, is typically used to inhibit corrosion in water treatment plants.

The chemical family that NTMPA belongs to is called phosphonates, which are based on the element phosphorus. Phosphonates are widely used in various applications, such as fertilizers and detergents, due to their ability to dissolve well in water and their non-toxic nature.

The development of new flow battery technologies is crucial for modernizing the U.S. electric grid and providing a means of storing energy from renewable sources like wind and solar power. The researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory were driven to find an electrolyte that could bind and store charged iron in a liquid complex at room temperature and neutral pH. Their goal was to develop battery materials that are abundant on Earth and can be sourced domestically.

But what exactly is a flow battery? Flow batteries consist of two chambers, each filled with a different liquid. These batteries charge through an electrochemical reaction and store energy in chemical bonds. When connected to an external circuit, they release that energy, which can power electrical devices. Unlike conventional batteries, flow batteries have two external supply tanks of liquid constantly circulating through them to supply the electrolyte. These tanks serve as the battery system's ""blood supply."" The more significant the electrolyte supply tank, the more energy the flow battery can store.

Flow batteries have the potential to serve as backup generators for the electric grid. They are a vital component of decarbonization strategies that aim to store energy from renewable resources. One advantage of flow batteries is their scalability. They can be built at any scale, from lab-bench size to the size of a city block.

In the short term, grid operators are considering locating battery energy storage systems (BESS) in urban or suburban areas near energy consumers. However, safety concerns often arise in these scenarios. The type of aqueous flow battery developed by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory could help alleviate these concerns.

""A BESS facility using the chemistry similar to what we have developed here would have the advantage of operating in water at neutral pH,"" said Aaron Hollas, a study author and team leader in PNNL's Battery Materials and Systems Group. ""In addition, our system uses commercially available reagents that haven't been previously investigated for use in flow batteries.""

The research team reported that their initial design can achieve an energy density of up to 9 watt-hours per liter (Wh/L). While commercialized vanadium-based systems are more than twice as energy dense, at 25 Wh/L, the advantage of a system built with Earth-abundant materials is that it can be scaled to provide the same energy output.

The future development of flow batteries holds promise for large-scale energy storage and the integration of renewable energy sources into the electric grid. The research conducted by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory showcases the potential of repurposing commonplace chemicals to create safe, economical, and sustainable battery designs. By utilizing Earth-abundant materials, these flow batteries can contribute to the modernization of the U.S. electric grid and the transition to a cleaner and more sustainable energy future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/new-all-liquid-iron-fl.jpg,2024-03-25 07:22:25,Innovation,Innovation

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-household-robots-common.html,Engineering household robots to have a little common sense,"From wiping up spills to serving food, robots are becoming increasingly adept at carrying out household tasks. Many of these robots learn through imitation, copying the movements guided by a human. However, robots often struggle to handle unexpected situations unless explicitly programmed to do so. To address this challenge, MIT engineers have developed a method that combines robot motion data with the ""common sense knowledge"" of large language models (LLMs). This approach allows robots to break down tasks into subtasks and adjust to disruptions without starting from scratch. The researchers will present their findings at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024) in May.

Traditionally, engineers would train a robot to perform a task by guiding it through the motions, such as scooping marbles from one bowl to another. However, these demonstrations are typically continuous trajectories, making it difficult for a robot to recover from mistakes during subtasks. To avoid the need for explicit labeling and programming of subtasks, the MIT researchers turned to LLMs. These deep learning models process vast amounts of text and can generate new sentences based on learned word connections. The researchers discovered that LLMs can also produce logical lists of subtasks for a given task, such as ""reach,"" ""scoop,"" ""transport,"" and ""pour"" for scooping marbles.

The team developed an algorithm that connects the LLM's natural language labels with the robot's physical position or state. This mapping, known as ""grounding,"" enables the robot to understand its progress within a task and autonomously replan and recover. By combining language models and robot motion data, the researchers have created a method that enhances a robot's ability to self-correct and improve overall task success.

This innovative approach has significant implications for the field of robotics. It reduces the need for explicit programming of every possible failure scenario, making robot training more efficient. Instead of relying solely on human demonstrations, robots can leverage the knowledge and logical sequencing provided by language models. As a result, robots can adapt to disruptions and errors more effectively, enhancing their capabilities in various household tasks.

The study conducted by the MIT engineers showcases the potential of combining language models with robot training. By bridging the gap between natural language labels and physical actions, robots gain a deeper understanding of tasks and can recover from mistakes. This research represents a step forward in developing robots with common sense and the ability to adjust to real-world scenarios. With continued advancements in this field, robots will become increasingly capable of performing complex household tasks and interacting with humans in more intuitive ways.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/engineering-household.jpg,2024-03-25 09:48:20,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-i-run-with-these-80-earbuds-instead-of-bone-conduction-headphones/,Why I run with these $80 earbuds instead of bone-conduction headphones,"The Edifier Comfo Run is a wireless sports headset that combines comfort, durability, and excellent sound quality. With 17 hours of listening time, a secure fit, an open-ear design for safety, and IP55 dust/water resistance, it is a great option for active individuals.

While bone conduction headsets have gained popularity in recent years, some people find the vibration associated with this technology uncomfortable, or they may not be satisfied with the lower volume and bass levels. Fortunately, there are now open-ear headsets available that offer a similar form factor to bone conduction headsets but with traditional speakers directed towards the ears.

These more traditional open-ear headsets can be found for under $100, making them a more affordable option. One such headset is the Edifier Comfo Run, which costs just $80. 

Personally, I still use earbuds with active noise cancellation for airplane travel and when I need to focus in the office. However, when I run or bike, I prefer open ear headsets. While most bone conduction headsets are expensive, ranging from $150 to $250, the Edifier Comfo Run provides a budget-friendly alternative without compromising on quality.

The Edifier Comfo Run is designed with soft silicone material and a comfortable neckband that exerts minimal pressure on the back of the neck. The headset fits securely over the ears and stays in place during various workouts, even when wearing sunglasses. It is also rated for IP55 dust and splash resistance, making it suitable for outdoor exercise.

Featuring 16.2mm dynamic drivers, the Edifier Comfo Run delivers impressive audio performance without relying on bone conduction technology. The large speaker grills are strategically positioned to provide excellent audio volume. With the Edifier ConneX smartphone app, users can even adjust the bass levels to suit their preferences.

The smartphone app also offers a pedometer functionality, although it does not connect to popular health tracking services like Apple Health or Google Fit. Therefore, this feature may be limited to those solely interested in step counting. Additionally, the app allows users to manage firmware updates for the headset.

One major advantage of this type of headset over earbuds is its longer battery life. The Edifier Comfo Run can provide up to 17 hours of playtime, surpassing most earbuds on the market. Charging is quick and convenient with the included USB cable and magnetic connector, with just 15 minutes of charging providing up to five hours of playback.

Although these types of headsets are primarily designed for working out, the Edifier Comfo Run performs well for phone calls. With two microphones and beamforming algorithms, call quality is clear and reliable. The microphones can also activate voice assistants on connected devices, allowing for convenient control while on the move.

The headset features three buttons on the top of the right side, positioned behind the ear. These buttons control volume, power, phone calls, and voice assistant activation. The primary controller is the center button, which has multiple functions depending on the number of presses or long presses. While it may take some time to learn all of the functions, the user manual provides detailed instructions.

As someone who has been using bone conduction headphones for exercise in the past few years, I find these new affordable open ear options to be quite compelling, especially considering they cost less than half the price. The Edifier Comfo Run offers everything I need in a headset, with its long battery life and seamless Bluetooth performance.

In conclusion, if you're looking for a durable and affordable headset to enhance your workout experience, the Edifier Comfo Run is worth considering. With its comfortable fit, excellent sound quality, and extended battery life, it ticks all the boxes. Say goodbye to lost earbuds and enjoy the security and awareness provided by the neckband open ear design.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/6cf4b19560d94152238ffc42101aee77a4eea4b4/2024/03/24/1b5e254a-dcc4-434c-8f77-9fff5392c3a8/edifier-comfo-run5.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-24 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/dma-first-formal-probes/,"Apple, Google and Meta face first formal investigations under EU's DMA","What’s the collective noun for investigations on Big Tech? Because the European Union has just announced a pile of probes on gatekeepers designated under the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Alphabet/Google, Apple, and Meta are facing the first formal non-compliance investigations under the bloc’s rebooted ex ante competition rulebook.

Alphabet/Google’s rules on steering in Google Play and its approach to self-preferencing in search results are in the frame. For Apple, the EU is also looking at its rules on steering in the App Store and the design of choice screens for alternatives to its Safari web browser. While Meta’s “pay or consent” model will be scrutinized by the Commission.

In total, five investigations were announced Monday — less than three weeks since the compliance deadline kicked in for the companies earlier this month.

The three gatekeepers, which were designated under the pan-EU market power and contestability regulation last fall, face formal investigation in these areas to determine whether they are breaching the rulebook, as the Commission suspects. Confirmed violations of the DMA can result in fines of up to 10% of global annual turnover, or even 20% for repeat offenses.

The EU will have up to 12 months to conclude the investigations, per recommended timeframes in the DMA. A preliminary report can be produced within six months. Although senior Commission officials noted Monday that the probes may conclude sooner or could take longer than these guidelines.

The enforcement action by the bloc comes as antitrust scrutiny continues to dial up on the three U.S. firms on home turf, too.

Since the three companies unveiled their DMA compliance plans, there has been a range of criticism that the proposals do not comply with the new EU law.

Google has been accused of seeking to avoid the regulation’s ban on self-preferencing by launching new rich features in search results that compete unfairly with rivals. While Apple’s use of notifications to users warning them of risks of stepping outside its walled garden has been attacked by developers as “scare screens”, among a number of criticisms. And Meta’s ‘pay or be tracked’ tactic has been roundly condemned as exploitative abuse by privacy and consumer rights groups. (Earlier this month the Commission sent Meta questions about this under the DMA’s sister regulation, the Digital Services Act, too.)

“The Commission has opened proceedings to assess whether the measures implemented by Alphabet and Apple in relation to their obligations pertaining to app stores are in breach of the DMA. Article 5(4) of the DMA requires gatekeepers to allow app developers to “steer” consumers to offers outside the gatekeepers’ app stores, free of charge,” the Commission wrote, saying it’s concerned the pair’s steering measures “may not be fully compliant as they impose various restrictions and limitations”, pointing, for example, to constraints on developers’ ability to “freely communicate and promote offers and directly conclude contracts”.

On concerns about Google self-preferencing, the EU said the investigation will focus on Google’s vertical search services (e.g., Google Shopping; Google Flights; Google Hotels) and the impact its action may have on similar rival services.

“The Commission is concerned that Alphabet’s measures implemented to comply with the DMA may not ensure that third-party services featuring on Google’s search results page are treated in a fair and non-discriminatory manner in comparison with Alphabet’s own services, as required by Article 6(5) of the DMA,” it wrote.

On Apple, the EU will also look at whether it’s complying with a range of user choice obligations on iOS — including enabling end-users to easily uninstall apps, easily change default settings, and prompt users with choice screens which it says “must effectively and easily allow them to select an alternative default service, such as a browser or search engine on their iPhones”.

“The Commission is concerned that Apple’s measures, including the design of the web browser choice screen, may be preventing users from truly exercising their choice of services within the Apple ecosystem, in contravention of Article 6(3) of the DMA,” it added.

On Meta, the EU said the proceedings will investigate whether its recently introduced “pay or consent” model for EU users complies with Article 5(2) of the DMA, noting that this portion of the regulation “requires gatekeepers to obtain consent from users when they intend to combine or cross-use their personal data across different core platform services”.

“The Commission is concerned that the binary choice imposed by Meta’s ‘pay or consent’ model may not provide a real alternative in case users do not consent, thereby not achieving the objective of preventing the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers,” it said.

Responding to a question about this probe during Monday’s press conference, the EU’s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, said the DMA puts a clear requirement on gatekeepers to offer a free, non-p","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1031626648.jpg?resize=1200,799",2024-03-25 12:10:10,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-switched-to-this-300-motorola-phone-for-two-weeks-and-was-pleasantly-surprised/,I switched to this $300 Motorola phone for two weeks and was pleasantly surprised,"The Moto G Power 5G is a phone that offers great features at an affordable price. With a 5,000mAh battery, it can last up to two days on a single charge. The phone also has a large display and a lovely vegan leather back panel. The Moto software enhancements ensure a smooth user experience.

Although the LCD display is not as vibrant as an OLED, this is one of the few tradeoffs for a device in this price range. However, the phone makes up for it with its other impressive features. In terms of design, the fingerprint sensor is integrated into the side power button, which is a convenient and secure way to unlock the phone. The phone is lightweight and the plastic frame helps with that. The Pale Lilac color and the vegan leather back give the phone a premium look and feel.

The 6.7-inch LCD display has a rare 120Hz refresh rate and an 85% screen-to-body ratio. The resolution is 391 ppi, which makes media content enjoyable to consume on the phone. The stereo speakers also perform well, and there is a 3.5mm audio port for wired listening.

In terms of performance, the Moto G Power 5G is powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 7020 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of internal storage. While there may be some stuttering and lag when navigating between apps and games, Motorola's RAM boost feature and the option to expand storage with a microSD card help mitigate these issues.

The camera setup includes a 50MP main camera and an 8MP ultra-wide camera. The ultra-wide camera also functions as a macro shooter, providing flexibility in capturing different types of photos. While the camera hardware may not be as powerful as flagship phones, Motorola's custom camera software compensates for it and allows users to capture great photos with ease.

One of the standout features of the Moto G Power 5G is its 5,000mAh battery. In daily use, the phone can easily last for two full days, even with heavy usage. The phone also supports fast 30W TurboPower charging and surprisingly, wireless charging, which is not commonly found in phones at this price range. Additionally, the phone supports 5G connectivity, ensuring a reliable signal even in areas with weaker cellular reception.

Overall, the Moto G Power 5G is a compelling option for those who want an affordable phone with great features. Motorola's attention to detail, such as the intuitive gestures and the inclusion of wireless charging, make this phone stand out from others in its price range. Whether you're a first-time smartphone user or someone looking for a device with a large display and sleek design, the Moto G Power 5G is definitely worth considering.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/32aa07ddf6226336c47ed03b859ff3c4e46a8471/2024/03/24/63400535-0c15-459c-aca0-c0cc32986912/moto-g-power-5g-20245.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-24 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelicamarideoliveira/2024/03/25/felipe-meneses-is-the-first-brazilian-thiel-fellow/,Felipe Meneses Is The First Brazilian Thiel Fellow,"Felipe Meneses, a young Brazilian tech entrepreneur, has made history by becoming the first Latin Thiel Fellow in 2024. The Thiel Fellowship, founded by billionaire Peter Thiel, offers $100,000 to individuals who choose to forgo college and instead start their own companies. This prestigious two-year acceleration program has attracted talented dropouts from all over the world since its inception in 2011.

Hailing from Sergipe, a northeastern state in Brazil, Meneses took the bold step of abandoning his undergraduate degree at Stanford University to pursue his entrepreneurial dreams. His selection for the Thiel Fellowship is a testament to his exceptional potential.

In 2022, Meneses teamed up with Felipe Lamounier, Daniel Silva, and Rohan Ramanath to establish Hyperplane, a data intelligence firm specializing in leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance banks' use of customer data. The company's hyper-personalization approach aims to revolutionize the customer experience. Based in Silicon Valley, Hyperplane initially started in Brazil and has already secured contracts with 12 of the country's leading financial institutions.

Hyperplane's success has not gone unnoticed, as the company has attracted significant investments totaling 30 million reais ($6 million) from prominent backers such as Lachy Groom, SV Angel, Clocktower Technology Ventures, Liquid2 Ventures, Soma Capital, Latitud, Atman Capital, Crestone VC, and Norte. The company's rapid growth and achievements have also earned it a spot in Endeavor's Scale-UP acceleration program for the first half of 2024.

Meneses's recognition as a Thiel Fellow is particularly noteworthy as he is the only Latin American founder to be selected for the program this year. In fact, the absence of entrepreneurs from the region on the list in 2023 further highlights the significance of Meneses's achievement.

The Thiel Fellowship has seen Latin representation in the past. In 2022, the initiative welcomed two Latin founders: Ian Lee from Chile, the founder of Examedi, a healthtech platform that connects patients with healthcare providers; and Tamara Chaya Romo from Mexico, the leader of MEDU, a company dedicated to developing reusable personal protective equipment.

Felipe Meneses's journey from Stanford dropout to Thiel Fellow exemplifies the immense potential and talent present in the Latin American tech entrepreneurship landscape. His success story serves as an inspiration to aspiring entrepreneurs in the region and beyond, showcasing the possibilities that lie outside the traditional education system.

The Thiel Fellowship continues to play a crucial role in empowering young visionaries like Meneses to pursue their entrepreneurial ambitions and make a lasting impact on the world. As the program expands its reach and recognizes talent from diverse backgrounds, it sets the stage for a more inclusive and innovative future.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66019447ce2364c0c92ae041/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 11:13:47,Innovation,Innovation
