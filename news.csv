Noisy audio recordings can be a real headache for audio engineers. However, a German startup called AI-coustics aims to solve this problem using generative AI technology to enhance the clarity of voices in videos. Recently, AI-coustics emerged from stealth with €1.9 million in funding, ready to revolutionize the audio industry.

According to Fabian Seipel, the co-founder and CEO of AI-coustics, their technology goes beyond standard noise suppression and can work across any device and speaker. The main goal of AI-coustics is to make every digital interaction, whether it's a conference call, consumer device, or casual social media video, as clear as a professional studio broadcast.

Seipel, who has a background in audio engineering, co-founded AI-coustics with Corvin Jaedicke, a machine learning lecturer at the Technical University of Berlin. The two met while studying audiotechnology at TU Berlin and often encountered poor audio quality in their online courses and tutorials. This personal experience motivated them to tackle the challenge of improving speech quality and intelligibility.

While there are already several AI-powered noise-suppressing and voice-enhancing software solutions in the market, AI-coustics differentiates itself through its unique approach to developing AI mechanisms for noise reduction. The startup uses a model trained on speech samples recorded in its own studio in Berlin. People are paid to record samples, which are then added to the dataset used to train AI-coustics' noise-reducing model.

One potential concern with AI-coustics' compensation scheme is whether creators of training data for AI models deserve residuals for their contributions. This issue is currently up for debate in the industry. Additionally, bias is another important consideration. Speech recognition algorithms can develop biases that negatively impact users. To address this, AI-coustics is actively recruiting diverse speech sample contributors to eliminate bias and ensure the technology works for all languages, speaker identities, ages, accents, and genders.

To test AI-coustics' performance, I uploaded three video clips to their platform: an interview with an 18th-century farmer, a car driving demo, and an Israel-Palestine conflict protest. The results were impressive. AI-coustics successfully boosted clarity, reducing ambient background noise and making the speakers much clearer.

The potential applications for AI-coustics' technology are vast. It can be used for real-time speech enhancement as well as recorded speech. The startup envisions embedding its technology in devices like soundbars, smartphones, and headphones to automatically enhance voice clarity. Currently, AI-coustics offers a web app and API for post-processing audio and video recordings, as well as an SDK to integrate their platform into existing workflows, apps, and hardware.

AI-coustics already has five enterprise customers and 20,000 users, with a mix of subscriptions, on-demand pricing, and licensing as their revenue streams. In the coming months, the company plans to expand its team and further improve its speech-enhancing model.

Overall, AI-coustics' innovative approach to noise reduction using generative AI shows great promise in tackling the challenge of poor audio quality in digital communications. With their technology, we can look forward to a future where every interaction is crystal clear and free from distracting background noise.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1009979808.jpg?resize=1200,801",2024-03-25 18:43:01,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.zdnet.com/article/saving-hours-of-work-with-ai-how-chatgpt-became-my-virtual-assistant-for-a-data-project/,Saving hours of work with AI: How ChatGPT became my virtual assistant for a data project,"There has been a lot of buzz around generative artificial intelligence (AI) in recent times. Tools like ChatGPT have garnered a fair share of attention. While they are indeed impressive, it's important to remember that they are just tools. They can assist us in various projects, similar to other productivity software.

Today, I want to share with you a project where ChatGPT proved to be a valuable time-saver. Although your projects may not require the same approach, I hope my thinking process behind the prompts will inspire you to consider ChatGPT as a workhorse tool for your own endeavors.

Let's dive into the project itself. In about a month, I plan to publish what I like to call a ""stunt article."" These articles are fun and captivating, and I know readers will find them interesting. The particular article I'm working on is a breakdown of how much computer gear I can purchase from Temu for under $100. The total came in at $99.77!

To put this article together, I explored the Temu website to find items worth highlighting. For instance, I stumbled upon an iPad keyboard and mouse that costs around $6. To stay within my budget, I wanted to add all the Temu links to a spreadsheet, find the prices for each item, and rearrange them until I achieved my desired total expenditure.

The challenge lied in converting the Temu links into something more practical. This is where ChatGPT came to the rescue.

Phase 1: Gathering the links
My first step involved collecting all the links. For each product, I copied the link from the Temu website and pasted it into a Notion page. Notion allows you to create bookmark blocks, which not only contain the links but also provide the product names. Here's a snapshot of that page:

[Insert Snapshot of Notion page]

As you can see, I've started selecting the blocks. Once all the blocks are selected, you can copy them. I simply pasted the entire set into a text editor, resulting in the following:

[Insert Snapshot of text editor]

The page may appear messy, but the result is useful.

Phase 2: Identifying the data
Now, let's examine one of the data blocks. I switched my editor out of dark mode to ensure the data elements are visible to you:

[Insert Snapshot of data block]

There are three essential elements here. The gold text indicates the product name, enclosed within braces. The green text represents the base URL of the product, enclosed within parentheses. We only need the main URL, so we should ignore the random tracking data passed to the Temu page after the question mark. The purple sections highlight the delimiters, which are the key components we will feed into ChatGPT.

Phase 3: Teaching ChatGPT to recognize the data
First, I provided ChatGPT with the following prompt:

""Accept the following data and await further instructions.""

Then, I copied all the information from the text editor and pasted it into ChatGPT. At this point, ChatGPT knew to wait for additional details.

The next step is where the project truly took off. I wanted ChatGPT to extract the titles and links while discarding the rest. Here's the prompt I used:

""The data above consists of a series of blocks. Each block begins with a section enclosed within [] brackets, which represents the title. Following the brackets is an open parenthesis (followed by a web URL). Extract the URL for each block, ensuring that everything after the question mark is removed, including the question mark itself. Most URLs will end in .html. We will label this as the URL. Display the title, followed by a carriage return, the URL, and two newlines.""

This process served two purposes. Firstly, it allowed me to name the data, making it easier for future reference. Secondly, it acted as a test to check if ChatGPT understood the instructions.

ChatGPT completed the assignment correctly, but it stopped about two-thirds of the way through due to a buffer issue. I instructed the bot to continue, and it provided me with the remaining data.

Had I performed this process manually, it would have involved tiresome cutting and pasting. With ChatGPT, the work was completed in under a minute.

Phase 4: Simplifying Temu's complex titles
For my project, the titles from Temu were too lengthy and convoluted. Instead, I aimed for something more concise and straightforward. For example, I transformed a title like:

""10 Inch LCD Writing Tablet, Electronis Memo With Leather Protective Case, Electronic Drawing Board For Digital Handwriting Pad Doodle Board, Gifts For""

into:

""LCD writing tablet with case""

I assigned this task to ChatGPT as well. I reminded the tool that it had previously parsed and identified the data. I find that reminding ChatGPT about a previous step helps it more reliably incorporate the information into the current task.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/70d8814af33b190ff84b8faa5f9bafe13d3586e2/2024/03/25/7d1cb1ff-3bb7-4972-a6cd-33d04da76bc1/cover.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/uzbekistan-unicorn-uzum-series-a-funding/,Meet Uzbekistan's first unicorn: e-commerce startup Uzum,"Uzum, an e-commerce startup, has recently secured $114 million in funding, making it the first unicorn in Uzbekistan with a valuation of $1.16 billion. With a population of over 35 million people, Uzbekistan provides fertile ground for startups, as 60% of its population is under the age of 30. The country also boasts a near 100% literacy rate, over 76% internet penetration, and more than 75% smartphone penetration rate. In 2020, Uzbekistan had nearly 1,200 startups, with fintech and e-commerce startups leading the market.

Despite these favorable conditions, Uzbekistan has a surprising lack of e-commerce services, accounting for only 2.2% of the country's total retail market. People in Uzbekistan primarily shopped online through social media apps like Instagram, TikTok, and Telegram, where sellers had limited product offerings and no logistics support. Recognizing this gap, Uzum's co-founder and CEO, Djasur Djumaev, saw the potential to create a comprehensive marketplace that offers end-to-end logistics and delivery, similar to what Amazon has done in other countries.

Uzum launched its marketplace in October 2022 and quickly gained traction. The platform now has over 8 million monthly active users and more than 9,000 merchants selling over 600,000 products. In comparison, the largest street bazaar in the country has about 70,000 products available on any given day. In its first year of operations, Uzum recorded a gross merchandise value (GMV) of $150 million and expects to reach at least $300 million in GMV this year.

Building on the success of its marketplace, Uzum expanded into fintech with a buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) product. Approximately 45% to 50% of e-commerce transactions on Uzum are done through the BNPL solution. The startup has also ventured into the food delivery business and established a digital bank to support its growth. By attracting customers through e-commerce, Uzum aims to retain them through high-transaction businesses like daily banking and monetize them through lending or credit products.

To fuel its expansion, Uzum recently raised $114 million in a Series A funding round. The round was led by FinSight Ventures and saw participation from Xanara Investment Management, Uzum's senior management, and other investors. Uzum plans to use the funding to further develop its fintech business and e-commerce arm. The startup also intends to raise an additional $200 million in a Series B round later this year from investors in the Middle East, U.K., and the U.S.

With the fresh funding, Uzum aims to launch new products for unsecured lending to individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises. The startup also plans to invest in its IT and logistics infrastructure. Uzum's goal is to expand its gross merchandise value by 150% to 200%, double its credit portfolio, and increase the total payment volume circulated through its ecosystem.

By the end of this year, Uzum plans to consolidate all its businesses into two super apps: one for consumer-focused offerings and another for business-focused products. Additionally, the startup aims to launch the country's largest logistics complex for e-commerce in June. Initially spanning 112,000 square meters, the complex will be expanded to over 500,000 square meters in the coming years.

While there are a few companies globally that operate similarly to Uzum, such as Latin America's Nubank and Kazakhstan's Kaspi.kz, Uzum doesn't see any direct competition in Uzbekistan. The startup enjoys different margins across its products and can make higher margins by combining its e-commerce and fintech services. With the necessary talent, resources, and products, Uzum aims to become a national tech leader in Uzbekistan.

In conclusion, Uzum's success as the first unicorn in Uzbekistan highlights the potential for startups in the country. With its comprehensive marketplace, fintech offerings, and plans for expansion, Uzum is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing e-commerce and digital payment trends in Uzbekistan.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/uzum-logistics.jpg?w=1200,2024-03-26 05:00:18,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-deep-geothermal-renewable-powerhouse.html,Dig deep: US bets on geothermal to become renewable powerhouse,"Geothermal energy is becoming an increasingly attractive option for businesses and the Biden administration as they look to transition to greener energy sources. Despite currently representing only a small fraction of US energy production, advancements in technology could make geothermal energy a reliable and scalable power source in the future.

During the CERAWeek conference in Houston, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm emphasized the potential of geothermal energy, stating that if we can tap into the heat beneath our feet, it could provide clean and reliable power for industries and households alike. The Department of Energy predicts that geothermal energy could surpass hydroelectric and solar power in the US by 2050.

Currently, geothermal energy accounts for just 1.6% of US energy consumption in 2022. To increase production, the US government has invested over $200 million in an experimental site in Utah since 2018. This site focuses on Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), a technology that involves drilling exceptionally deep wells and injecting water into naturally hot rocks. Unlike traditional geothermal energy, EGS does not require a nearby hot spring or underground reservoir. This approach reduces upfront risks and has attracted more investors.

One advantage of geothermal energy is that it produces fewer chemical additives compared to classic fracking, a process that extracts oil and natural gas. Additionally, geothermal drilling does not release hydrocarbons like fracking does. Unlike solar or wind power, geothermal energy provides a consistent flow of energy regardless of weather conditions or the time of day.

In terms of cost, the US government estimates that geothermal energy will become more affordable, dropping from the current range of $70 to $100 per megawatt hour (MWh) to $45 by 2035. The use of existing drilling technology makes geothermal energy quicker and cheaper to develop. This has attracted the attention of companies like Baker Hughes, which has invested in geothermal energy. While experimental EGS sites exist in other countries, the US has been at the forefront of developing this new technology.

However, geothermal drilling projects, like fracking, can potentially cause seismic activity. In France, a deep-drilling project was abandoned in 2020 due to tremors it caused in the Alsace region. The US Energy Department requires all funded geothermal projects to follow a mitigation protocol to address induced seismicity and is funding further research on the issue. It's worth noting that no community has reported feeling seismic activity near a DOE-funded project.

Despite the challenges, the geothermal energy market is gaining momentum, with several US and Canadian start-ups raising significant investments. For example, Fervo Energy recently connected its Nevada site to the electric grid in collaboration with Google. While the site is currently generating only 3.5 megawatts, major companies like Google, Microsoft, and Nucor are already showing interest in purchasing geothermal energy.

Cindy Taff, CEO of Sage Geosystems, believes that the geothermal energy market is still open for new and next-generation technologies. She highlights the need for the first successful commercial facility to pave the way for others to follow suit. As the sector continues to grow, it is important to prioritize sustainable and responsible development to ensure long-term success.

In conclusion, geothermal energy has the potential to play a significant role in the green transition. As technology advances and investment increases, geothermal energy could become a reliable and scalable power source for various industries and households. While challenges exist, such as the risk of seismic activity, ongoing research and mitigation protocols aim to address these concerns. The geothermal energy market is still in its early stages, but with growing demand and major companies showing interest, the future looks promising.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/a-worker-operates-a-dr.jpg,2024-03-25 04:59:03,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/large-language-models-can-help-home-robots-recover-from-errors-without-human-help/,Large language models can help home robots recover from errors without human help,"Home robots have struggled to gain widespread success for a variety of reasons, such as pricing, practicality, form factor, and mapping. Even when these challenges are addressed, there is still the issue of what happens when a robot inevitably makes a mistake. This problem is not limited to consumer robots; it is also a challenge in the industrial sector. However, large companies have the resources to address these problems as they arise, while consumers do not.

Fortunately, recent research from MIT suggests that large language models (LLMs) can be used to address this issue. A study set to be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) in May aims to bring ""common sense"" into the process of correcting mistakes. The researchers explain that robots are excellent mimics but they often lack the ability to adjust to unexpected situations without starting the task from the beginning.

Traditionally, when a robot encounters an issue, it will exhaust its pre-programmed options before requiring human intervention. This is particularly challenging in a home environment where changes to the status quo can disrupt a robot's ability to function. Imitation learning, which involves learning to perform a task through observation, is popular in the field of home robotics. However, it often fails to account for small environmental variations that can interfere with regular operation, necessitating a robot to start from scratch. The new research addresses this problem by breaking demonstrations into smaller subsets rather than treating them as one continuous action.

This is where LLMs come into play. They eliminate the need for a programmer to manually label and assign numerous subactions. LLMs can provide instructions for each step of a task in natural language. The researchers wanted to connect the continuous demonstrations performed by humans with the subtasks identified by the LLMs so that a robot would know its progress in a task and be able to replan and recover on its own.

The study focuses on training a robot to scoop marbles and pour them into an empty bowl. While this may be a simple task for humans, it requires the robot to perform various small tasks. The LLMs are capable of listing and labeling these subtasks. During the demonstrations, the researchers purposely sabotaged the activity by bumping the robot off course and knocking marbles out of its spoon. Instead of starting from scratch, the system self-corrected the small tasks.

According to Tsun-Hsuan Wang, a grad student involved in the research, this method eliminates the need for humans to program or provide additional demonstrations to recover from failures.

This research presents an intriguing solution to the challenges faced by home robots. By using LLMs to break tasks into smaller subtasks and providing natural language instructions, robots can adapt and self-correct when mistakes occur. This not only saves time and effort but also makes home robots more capable and user-friendly.

In conclusion, the use of large language models in home robotics has the potential to revolutionize the industry. By addressing the issue of mistakes and providing robots with the ability to self-correct, these models make home robots more practical and efficient. As technology continues to advance, we can expect to see more innovative solutions that enhance the capabilities of home robots and improve their overall performance. So, the next time you consider purchasing a home robot, remember that they are becoming smarter and more adaptable, thanks to the power of language models.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/CommonSense-01-press_0.jpg?w=900,2024-03-25 20:01:06,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.zdnet.com/article/five-linux-file-and-folder-management-commands-you-need-to-know/,Five Linux file and folder management commands you need to know,"Linux is a powerful operating system with a multitude of commands at your disposal. With over 1,000 commands on a basic service, and even more on the desktop, it can be overwhelming to navigate through them all. However, as a Linux user, you will only end up using a fraction of these commands in your lifetime, especially when it comes to file and folder management. In this article, we will explore five essential Linux commands that every user should learn, in addition to the previously mentioned five. These commands will help you efficiently manage your files and folders, making your Linux experience even more productive.

1. mkdir - Creating Directories
Let's start with the 'mkdir' command, which allows you to create directories, also known as folders. To create a new folder, simply use the following command:
mkdir FOLDER
Replace 'FOLDER' with the desired name of your folder. For example, if you want to create a folder named 'TEST' in your current working directory, you can use the following command:
mkdir ~/TEST
This will create a new folder named 'TEST' in the root of your home directory. But what if you want to create a nested folder structure, such as 'TEST/project1,' and the 'TEST' folder doesn't exist yet? No worries! You can use the '-p' option to create the entire structure at once, like this:
mkdir -p ~/TEST/project1

2. less - Viewing File Contents
Next, let's explore the 'less' command, which allows you to view the contents of a file. This command is particularly useful when you don't need to edit the file and want to view it page by page. To view a file, simply use the following command:
less FILENAME
Replace 'FILENAME' with the path to the file you want to view. For example, if you want to view the contents of '/etc/samba/smb.conf,' you can use the following command:
less /etc/samba/smb.conf
The 'less' command will display the file's content one page at a time, allowing you to scroll through it easily.

3. cat - Displaying File Contents
The 'cat' command is another useful tool for viewing file contents, but with a different approach. Instead of viewing the file page by page, 'cat' displays the entire content in one go. To view a file using 'cat,' simply use the following command:
cat FILENAME
Replace 'FILENAME' with the path to the file you want to view. For example, if you want to view the contents of '/etc/fstab,' you can use the following command:
cat /etc/fstab
Unlike 'less,' you cannot scroll through the output of 'cat' unless your terminal window allows it. However, 'cat' is handy when you want to concatenate files or append the content of one file to another. For example, if you have 'TEST/project1/file1.txt' and 'TEST/project1/file2.txt' and want to append the content of 'file1.txt' to the end of 'file2.txt,' you can use the following command:
cat TEST/project1/file1.txt >> TEST/project1/file2.txt
This will add the content of 'file1.txt' to the bottom of 'file2.txt.'

4. touch - Creating Empty Files
The 'touch' command is a simple yet powerful tool. Its primary purpose is to change file timestamps, but most users employ it to create empty files. To create an empty file, use the following command:
touch FILENAME
Replace 'FILENAME' with the desired name of your file. For example, if you want to create a file named 'test' in your home directory, you can use the following command:
touch ~/test
Once you have an empty file, you can add content to it using various methods. For instance, you can use the 'echo' command to add content, like this:
echo ""New Content"" > ~/test
This will add the text ""New Content"" to the 'test' file. If you want to append more content to the file, you can use the following command:
echo ""More Content"" >> ~/test
The difference between the '>' and '>>' operators is crucial. The '>' operator overwrites the file's content, while '>>' appends the new text to the end of the file.

5. pwd - Knowing Your Current Directory
Lastly, let's talk about the 'pwd' command, which stands for ""print working directory."" Sometimes, you might need to know your current directory, especially when navigating through the Linux filesystem hierarchy. To find out where you are, simply use the following command:
pwd
This will display the absolute path of your current working directory. For example, if you're in '/var/www/html/site1,' issuing the 'pwd' command will output '/var/www/html/site1.' Although you might not need to use 'pwd' frequently, it's always good to have this command in your arsenal when you need to know your location.

By mastering these five additional Linux commands, you'll be well-equipped to handle file and folder management efficiently. Combine them with the previously mentioned five commands, and you'll have a solid foundation for navigating and manipulating your files on Linux. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced Linux user, these commands will undoubtedly improve your productivity and enhance your overall Linux experience.

In conclusion, Linux offers a vast array of commands, but it's essential to focus on the ones that provide the most value for everyday tasks. By learning and understanding these ten commands, you'll be able to navigate, manage, and view your files and folders with ease. Embrace the power of the command line, and let Linux empower you to accomplish your goals efficiently. Happy Linuxing!",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/73a6f654a7f5dd5cfc8e3389ab98f6a3dc1aafce/2024/03/25/49237a5b-9c57-4f0a-b810-21a85165bfeb/5penguinsflyinggettyimages-520459992.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation

In other news, SpaceX is making progress in certifying a second launch pad for astronaut missions. This will help alleviate launch site congestion and allow the company to increase the number of human launches it can perform. As a preliminary step, SpaceX recently launched an uncrewed Dragon capsule to the International Space Station from this second pad. The next step for SpaceX is to send a crewed mission into space.

Last Thursday, Rocket Lab successfully completed its fourth launch from Virginia. The Electron rocket carried a classified payload for the National Reconnaissance Office. This mission marks the fifth and final launch that Rocket Lab has performed for NRO under a contract awarded in 2020. If you missed the launch, you can watch the replay here.

Now, let's take a look at an interesting article I came across. Bloomberg recently published a story that explores how the rise of NewSpace companies has impacted hiring and retention at NASA. It's a fascinating read that delves into the complexities of this issue. If you're curious about the changing landscape of the space industry and its effects on traditional space agencies like NASA, I highly recommend checking out this article.

On this day in space history, we remember the space shuttle Columbia's touchdown on March 30, 1982. After a successful eight-day mission, astronauts Jack R. Lousma and C. Gordon Fullerton safely returned home, landing at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. It was a historic moment that marked another achievement in human space exploration.

That wraps up our latest news and updates from the world of space. Stay tuned for more exciting developments, and until next time, keep looking up to the stars!",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/tc-space-hero.gif?w=941,2024-03-25 22:00:11,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.zdnet.com/article/amazon-knows-you-dont-have-the-ai-skills-for-tomorrow-and-has-a-plan-to-help/,"Amazon knows you don't have the AI skills for tomorrow, and has a plan to help","Amazon, one of the most innovative companies globally, is making strides in incorporating AI and machine learning into its operations. Victor Reinoso, the global director of education philanthropy at Amazon, sat down with us to discuss the future of education and AI.

Reinoso, who has a background in venture capitalism, consulting, and previously served as the D.C. deputy mayor for education, is passionate about preparing students for the careers of the future. At Amazon, he combines his experience to invest in innovations and nonprofit partnerships that will inspire and equip young people for success.

One of the challenges schools face in integrating AI education into their curriculums is the lack of resources and expertise. While teachers are eager to teach AI content to their students, they often struggle to find the necessary tools and knowledge. According to a recent survey conducted by Amazon and Access Partnership, 70% of educators lack the resources to teach foundational AI skills, despite 60% believing that these skills should be taught from Grade 6 through university.

To bridge this education gap, Reinoso suggests funding educator training and providing access to tools and curriculum. Amazon is already taking steps in this direction through initiatives such as the AI Ready commitment, which aims to provide free AI skills training to two million people by 2025. They have collaborated with Code.org to create Hour of Code Dance Party: AI Edition, where K-12 students and teachers can learn about coding and generative AI. Additionally, Amazon is offering scholarships for high school and university students to access a generative AI course on Udacity for free. They also provide a range of AI and generative AI courses for professionals in the workplace.

Another crucial aspect of AI education is teaching responsible AI use. Teachers recognize the importance of instilling responsible AI practices in students, with 60% prioritizing this aspect in the curriculum. As AI continues to evolve, responsible stewards will play a vital role in guiding its ethical application.

Amazon's efforts in advancing AI education are commendable. By addressing the education gap and promoting responsible AI use, they are equipping the next generation with the skills and knowledge needed to thrive in an AI-driven world. Through their initiatives and collaborations, they are empowering educators and students to embrace the opportunities offered by AI and become active contributors to its development.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/08bc5883c45c188259ecb098a51ea114dc119601/2024/03/25/38b15b64-4b2d-45b8-8147-39fda8737c67/amazon-future-engineer-career-discovery-day-20231024-bsd-students-1010.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 10:59:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/elon-musk-x-ccdh-california-lawsuit-dismissed/,A judge just killed Elon Musk's lawsuit against an anti-hate research org,"A federal judge ruled against Elon Musk today, dismissing a lawsuit filed by Musk and X against a nonprofit organization that focuses on researching online hate. X had sued the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) last year, claiming that the group spread misleading information through a series of reports on hate and extremism on the platform. In the lawsuit, X alleged that it suffered significant financial losses as a result of CCDH’s research.

Musk and X further accused the CCDH of illegally scraping data and violating the platform’s rules by aggregating content using a third-party social media monitoring tool called Brandwatch. Musk, who personally directed the lawsuit, referred to the CCDH as an ""evil propaganda machine"" in his replies on X.

Last year, the CCDH filed a motion to dismiss X’s claims under California’s Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (SLAPP) law, which is meant to prevent frivolous lawsuits that are primarily intended to intimidate. The CCDH also requested that the judge dismiss the lawsuit. CCDH CEO Imran Ahmed accused Musk, who is worth around $200 billion, of deliberately prolonging the legal process to increase the organization’s legal costs.

On Monday, United States District Judge Charles R. Breyer of the Northern District of California granted the CCDH’s motion to dismiss the case. Breyer also denied Musk and X the opportunity to refile the lawsuit.

Judge Breyer stated in the ruling that sometimes it is unclear what motivates a litigation, and that in this case, it was evident that X brought the lawsuit to punish the CCDH for criticizing X in its publications. The judge also suggested that X may have wanted to discourage others from engaging in similar criticism.

Following Musk’s increased presence on Twitter, the CCDH highlighted the rise of hate speech on the platform. One report explored how Musk's decision to unban several highly followed extremists could potentially boost the company's ad revenue. This included Andrew Anglin, a notorious neo-Nazi who created the white supremacist website, the Daily Stormer.

The CCDH, established in 2018, focuses on researching hate speech, extremism, and misinformation on major social networks. Its research consistently exposes disturbing content on social platforms, including reports on eating disorder content on TikTok, climate denial on YouTube, and violent misogynistic threats on Instagram.

Reacting to the ruling, CCDH CEO Imran Ahmed stated, “We create costs for lies and hate. The courts today have affirmed our fundamental right to research, to speak, to advocate, and to hold social media companies accountable for decisions they make behind closed doors that affect our children, our democracy, and our fundamental human rights and civil liberties.”

The nonprofit's legal team included Roberta Kaplan, who recently achieved a major victory in the E. Jean Carroll defamation case against former President Donald Trump. Kaplan commented on Monday's ruling, saying that it demonstrates that even the world's wealthiest individual cannot manipulate the rule of law to suit their own interests.

Although the CCDH celebrated its victory in California, Musk is pursuing a similar lawsuit against the left-leaning media watchdog organization, Media Matters for America. Unlike the CCDH lawsuit, X is suing Media Matters for America in Texas, which does not have the same protections against frivolous lawsuits aimed at suppressing free speech as California does.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/twitter-x-logo-musk-pattern.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-25 20:33:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-favorite-linux-text-editors-and-why-you-should-be-using-one/,My favorite Linux text editors (and why you should be using one),"Linux has always had a range of text editors, but their purpose has evolved over time. While they were traditionally used for configuring Linux or writing code, text editors are now being used for a variety of tasks, such as note-taking, journaling, and even writing novels. In this blog post, we will explore some of the best text editors for Linux that are suitable for everyday users.

Before we dive into the list, it's important to note that two popular editors, vi and Emacs, will not be included. While both of these editors are powerful, they can be quite complex and overwhelming for the average user. This article focuses on text editors that are easier to use but still effective. However, if you are an advanced user and find the editors listed here too simple or not flexible enough, vi and Emacs are always available as powerful alternatives for coding, configuring, and administering your Linux system.

Now, let's explore some of the top text editors for Linux:

1. Nano:
Nano has been my go-to text editor for decades. While it may seem basic, it gets the job done efficiently. Nano includes all the essential features you need in an editor, such as interactive search-and-replace, undo/redo, syntax coloring, smooth scrolling, auto-indentation, and more. It also supports file locking and internationalization. Nano is a terminal application, which means you can open it by issuing the command ""nano filename"" in the terminal. It comes pre-installed with most Linux distributions and is completely free to use.

2. Gedit:
Gedit is the default text editor for the GNOME desktop environment. It is a simple yet effective graphical application that offers features like tabs, support for internationalized text (UTF-8), syntax highlighting, markdown support, configurable fonts and colors, printing, auto-save, keyboard shortcuts, theming, and full-screen mode. Gedit's simplicity and ease of use make it a great choice for everyday editing tasks. You can open Gedit by clicking on a text file, which makes it a convenient option for quick edits. Like Nano, Gedit is also free and ships with most GNOME-based desktop distributions.

3. COSMIC Text Editor:
COSMIC Text Editor is set to become the default text editor for System76's COSMIC desktop once it is released. While it is still in development, COSMIC Text Editor shows great promise. It will offer features such as syntax highlighting, standard keyboard shortcuts, find and spellcheck functionality, project support, revert changes, document statistics, and even Git management support. COSMIC Text Editor's simplicity and sleek design make it a pleasure to use. It will be available for free when the COSMIC Desktop OS ships.

4. Kate:
Kate is the KDE Plasma equivalent of Gedit for the GNOME desktop. It offers a few additional features, such as multi-cursor and multi-cursor selection, which allow you to select and manipulate multiple strings of text simultaneously. Kate also features project support, syntax highlighting, standard keyboard shortcuts, and plugins. With plugins, you can enhance Kate's functionality by adding features like SQL query support, GDB debugging, and one-click project build. Kate is a supercharged version of Gedit that can handle both basic and more advanced text editing tasks. It is free to use and is available for the KDE Plasma desktop environment.

In conclusion, Linux offers a wide range of text editors that cater to different needs and preferences. Whether you prefer a basic terminal-based editor like Nano, a simple GUI editor like Gedit, a sleek and upcoming editor like COSMIC Text Editor, or a feature-rich editor like Kate, there is a text editor for everyone on Linux. So, try out these editors and find the one that suits your workflow and style the best. Happy editing!",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/feda4ca65eefc13df0e3505780d84330ecd3c713/2024/03/25/d964a97e-9c56-444a-9497-19bc7ca26a56/typingclosegettyimages-1341060766.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/match-board-directors-after-talks-activist-investor-elliott-management/,Match appoints two board directors after talks with activist investor Elliott Management,"Tinder-owner Match Group has recently made significant moves, appointing two new members to its board of directors and entering into an agreement with Elliott Management, an activist investor. Laura Jones, Chief Marketing Officer at Instacart, and Spencer Rascoff, co-founder of Zillow, will be joining Match Group's board with immediate effect.

According to Match Group, these appointments are a result of a ""constructive dialogue"" with Elliott Management, and the two companies have also entered into an ""information-sharing"" agreement. This development comes after reports from The Wall Street Journal revealed that Elliott Management had acquired a stake of approximately $1 billion in Match Group. Elliott Management is known for its active involvement in tech companies, pushing for changes and improvements.

The decline in paying users that Match Group has been experiencing, coupled with the uncertain economic climate, has prompted Elliott Management to engage in discussions on how to improve the company's performance. In response, Match Group expressed its appreciation for the collaboration with Elliott and its belief in the opportunity for significant value creation as the global leader in online dating. Marc Steinberg, partner at Elliott, commended the addition of Laura Jones and Spencer Rascoff to the board, stating that their unique skills and perspectives will support the company's growth in the future.

Match Group's fourth-quarter results for 2023 showed a 5% decrease in the number of total paid users compared to the previous year, with a total of 15.2 million paid users. The company's growth has slowed down from its peak during the COVID-19 pandemic, and its stock has declined by 79% since its peak in 2021.

It's worth noting that Match Group is the parent company of various popular dating apps such as Tinder, Hinge, Match.com, Meetic, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, and OurTime, among others.

The addition of Laura Jones and Spencer Rascoff to Match Group's board of directors, along with the collaboration with Elliott Management, indicates the company's commitment to addressing its challenges and pursuing growth opportunities. With their expertise and fresh perspectives, Match Group aims to navigate the evolving online dating landscape and regain momentum in the market.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1241790742.jpeg?w=1024,2024-03-25 14:15:04,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2024/03/25/todays-wordle-1011-hints-clues-and-answer-for-tuesday-march-26th/,"Today’s ‘Wordle’ 1011 Hints, Clues And Answer For Tuesday, March 26th","How to Solve Today's Wordle

It's almost the end of March, and it has been quite an unusual month. Winter seems reluctant to leave, overpowering the budding spring. Today, the sun is shining and the snow is melting, but there's more snow in the forecast for Easter weekend. And then, just after Easter, we have April Fool's Day, a day I personally don't enjoy. It's probably best to stay offline on that day to avoid falling for any pranks.

Interestingly enough, I actually managed to guess the Wordle correctly on April Fool's Day. I chose ""march"" because if I were playing a Wordle-style prank, I would pick the only other month with five letters that isn't just a proper noun. (April is only a proper noun and therefore can't be an answer in Wordle).

Speaking of proper nouns, yesterday's Wordle really threw me off!

Now, let's get to today's Wordle.

How to Solve Today's Wordle

Hint: Politician
Clue: The word ends with a consonant

Wordle Analysis

Every day, I anxiously check Wordle Bot to see how I did. You can check your Wordles with Wordle Bot right here.

I was so confident with my third guess, only to have my victory snatched away when the third box turned grey. Oh well, that's life! My initial guess was close, but not quite there. I had 196 words remaining and only one lonely yellow 'O'. I managed to narrow it down to 11 possibilities and was given two more yellow boxes to work with. After some juggling, I settled on ""major"" because it shared the letter 'M' with a few other words I had in mind. Unfortunately, it turned out to be ""mayor"" and not ""major"" that was the correct answer for today's Wordle.

Competitive Wordle Score

I lose 1 point because the Bot got it right in just three guesses (crane / tyros / mayor — tyros? Really?), and I get 0 points for guessing in four. Overall, I'm at -1. Sigh.

Today's Wordle Etymology

The word ""mayor"" originates from the Old French word ""maire,"" which means ""head of a city or town government."" This Old French term comes from the Latin word ""maior,"" which translates to ""greater"" or ""superior."" In Latin, ""maior"" was used in the title ""maior domus"" or ""major domo,"" meaning ""chief steward"" of a noble house, indicating a position of authority and oversight. Over time, ""maior"" transformed into various forms in the Romance languages, eventually leading to the English word ""mayor."" The role of a mayor as the leader of a city or municipal government reflects this historical sense of being a superior or chief official within a local jurisdiction.
