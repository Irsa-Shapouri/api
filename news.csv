Welcome back, Strands players! Today, we're diving into the exciting world of the Strands puzzle. While we have a name for Wordle solvers (""Wordlers""), we don't have a specific term for Strands players. ""The Stranded"" might sound a little bleak, but sometimes, when faced with this challenging game, I do feel a little stranded. Perhaps we can call ourselves ""Stranders""? 

Today's puzzle was particularly tricky, and it took me quite a while to figure it out. However, I'm sure there are some of you out there who solved it right away. It's all about context, isn't it? 

Now, let's dive into the details and unravel the mystery of the Strands puzzle!

How to Play Strands

The Strands puzzle by The New York Times is a modern twist on the classic word search game. Currently in beta, this game will stick around if enough people play it every day. 

Every day, a new game of Strands awaits you. You'll be presented with a grid of letters, measuring six by eight. Your goal is to find a group of words that share a common theme, with a clue to guide you in the right direction. Once you find a theme word, it will be highlighted in blue, so you won't lose track of it. 

But that's not all! You also need to find a special word called a spangram. This word reveals what the theme words have in common. To make it even more interesting, the spangram connects two opposite sides of the board. While the theme words won't be proper names, the spangram can be. When you find the spangram, it will be highlighted in yellow, ensuring you don't miss it.

And now, without further ado, let's uncover the answers to today's Strands puzzle!

- Scales
- Twins

Today's Strands Challenge

Today's Strands puzzle proved to be quite tricky. Yesterday's puzzle had me completely baffled, and today was no different. I had to rely on a few hints, but they didn't offer much help initially. First, I found ""Bull,"" followed by ""Goat."" This actually confused me even more because I thought I was looking for animal-related words. I had no clue how animals connected with sign language. I even tried ""Stop,"" but that didn't work either. Sometimes, you really have to think outside the box in these puzzles. 

Then, I stumbled upon ""Virgin,"" and my confusion deepened. It wasn't until I noticed the word ""OLOGY"" that I made progress. I started looking for words that could fit at the beginning of ""OLOGY,"" but ""ONTOLOGY"" didn't work. Finally, I spotted it: astrology. Suddenly, everything fell into place. All the previous words were actually constellations! I found ""Archer"" next, followed by ""Twins,"" and finally, ""Scorpion,"" although that last one gave me quite a tough time.

By the way, I recently watched the film Taxi Driver after many, many years, and it was such a bizarre coincidence. In one scene, Travis (Robert DeNiro) and Iris (Jodie Foster) have breakfast together, and she talks extensively about astrological signs. Talk about odd timing!

In the end, everything worked out well, as it always does. How did you fare with today's Strands puzzle? I'd love to hear about your experience on Twitter and Facebook.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/24/see-the-moon-eclipsed-by-earth-as-americas-total-solar-eclipse-draws-near-the-night-sky-this-week/,See The Moon Begin Its ‘Eclipse Season:’ The Night Sky This Week,"The Night Sky This Week: March 25-31, 2024

North America is currently experiencing a golden age of eclipses, and this week marks an important moment leading up to a significant event next week. In the early hours of Monday, March 25, the full worm moon will be partially eclipsed by Earth, creating a penumbral lunar eclipse. While this may not be a total lunar eclipse with the striking ""blood moon"" effect, it sets the stage for an upcoming total solar eclipse on Monday, April 8, 2024.

If you're as excited about this celestial event as I am, here are some planning tips to ensure you don't miss it. But before we get into that, let's explore what else the night sky has to offer this week.

Throughout the week, the waning gibbous moon will pass close to a couple of bright stars as it rises later and later at night. This means the early evening skies will be ideal for stargazing by the weekend.

Now, let's dive into the details of this week's celestial highlights:

Monday, March 25: 'Worm Moon Lunar Eclipse'

The third full moon of 2024, known as the ""Worm Moon,"" will pass through Earth's outer shadow in space. This will result in a slight penumbral lunar eclipse visible from the night side of Earth, including North and South America, Europe, East Asia, Australia, and New Zealand.

In New York, the eclipse will begin at 00:53 a.m. EDT and end at 05:32 a.m. EDT, with the maximum eclipse occurring at 03:12 a.m. EDT. In Los Angeles, the eclipse will take place from 9:53 p.m. PDT until 02:32 a.m. PDT on Sunday, March 24/Monday, March 25, with the maximum eclipse at 00:12 a.m. EDT.

Tuesday, March 26: Moon and Spica

A few hours after sunset, step outside and witness the almost full moon rising due east. But there's something special about this moonrise. Just to the top right of the rising moon, you'll see the bright star Spica, the brightest star in the constellation Virgo and one of the 20 brightest stars in the night sky. It will be within 1.4 degrees of our natural satellite.

Saturday, March 30: Moon and Antares

If you find yourself awake late on Friday into the early hours of Saturday, take a look towards the southeast. You'll be greeted by a 78%-lit waning gibbous moon positioned less than a degree from Antares, a red supergiant star in the constellation Scorpius.

Galaxies of the Week: Bode's and the Cigar

This week, Ursa Minor and Ursa Major, visible in the northern sky after dark, offer the opportunity to observe two stunning galaxies through an 8-inch telescope.

M81, also known as Bode's galaxy, is a large spiral galaxy located approximately 12 million light-years from Earth. It shines as one of the brightest galaxies in the night sky. On the other hand, M82, known as the Cigar galaxy, is a starburst galaxy situated about 12 million light-years away. It is renowned for its high rate of star formation. In a telescope's field of view, you can spot small, diffuse patches of light northwest of the bright star Dubhe in the Big Dipper.

Eclipse Tip of the Week: Preparing for the Total Solar Eclipse

Less than two weeks remain until one of the rarest and most breathtaking celestial phenomena occurs in North America—a total solar eclipse. If you haven't made solid plans yet, now is the time to act. Remember, you must position yourself within the path of totality (the yellow stripe on the map) to witness the full spectacle. Simply being close to it won't provide the same experience. To assist in your preparations, check out the abundance of articles on my feed or visit websites that offer maps, simulations, and event listings.

Please note that the times and dates mentioned are specific to mid-northern latitudes. For location-specific information, consult online planetariums such as Stellarium and The Sky Live. Additionally, be sure to check planet-rise/planet-set, sunrise/sunset, and moonrise/moonset times for your specific location.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/non-sexy-industries-can-appeal-to-investors-too/,Non-sexy industries can appeal to investors too,"Welcome to TechCrunch Fintech! In this edition, we will be exploring some exciting fintech startups in Africa, discussing the benefits Copilot has gained from Mint's closure, and delving into the reasons why venture capitalists are investing heavily in a particular expense management startup.

Africa's fintech ecosystem has seen a decline in venture funding recently, but there have been some positive developments in the past week. Uber led a $100 million investment in Moove, a fintech startup focused on African mobility, resulting in a valuation of $750 million. Additionally, Zone secured $8.5 million in funding to expand its decentralized payment infrastructure. Tanzanian payments company Nala successfully pivoted to offer remittance services in 2021 and also developed a B2B payment platform.

The closure of budgeting app Mint by Intuit has created opportunities for startups in the space. Copilot, in particular, has experienced substantial growth in the last four months, surpassing the growth it achieved in the previous four years. This growth enabled Copilot to secure $6 million in Series A funding led by Nico Wittenborn's Adjacent. Mint's closure has also benefited Monarch Money, as mentioned by Ozzie Osman, co-founder of the company.

Expense management startup Coast has seen remarkable revenue growth of 550% in the past year. The company focuses on serving businesses with real-world field personnel and fleets to manage. Coast recently raised an additional $25 million in equity funding. Onyx Private, a digital bank backed by Y Combinator, initially targeted high-earning millennials and Gen Zers but has now shifted its focus to B2B operations. The startup recently announced the termination of its bank operations and closure of customer accounts.

Swiss fintech nsave has raised $4 million in seed funding. The company aims to provide banking services in Switzerland to individuals in countries with unstable banking sectors or those facing high inflation.

Despite the significant growth in the fintech industry, there is still immense untapped potential. Eric Glyman, co-founder and CEO of Ramp, believes that companies like his are only scratching the surface, with a market share of just 1%. Both Ramp and Deel celebrated their fifth anniversaries this week.

In a recent antitrust complaint against Apple, the U.S. Justice Department specifically targets the company's financial business, highlighting its magnitude.

In other news, Bolt and Checkout.com have joined forces to create a frictionless commerce experience. Rewards startup Fetch has raised $50 million from Morgan Stanley to capitalize on the private credit boom. Wealthfront has postponed its IPO plans. Keith Rabois, a director at Affirm Holdings, has sold shares worth over $318,000. Cloud banking technology provider nCino has acquired DocFox. Marco has raised $12 million to support trade finance in Latin America. PayPal-backed NX Technologies has raised $24 million to streamline automotive payments. Prizepool has received a cease & desist letter from the FDIC for false and misleading statements. DLocal has appointed Pedro Arnt as CEO while Sebastián Kanovich steps back. Ryan Zauk has joined OMERS Ventures as a fintech investor. Klarna is challenging Visa and Mastercard with its open banking initiative.
