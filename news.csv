https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-vulnerability-virtual-reality.html,Vulnerability in virtual reality systems identified,"Virtual reality systems have opened up a whole new world of possibilities for users to immerse themselves in. However, a team of computer scientists at the University of Chicago has recently discovered a potential vulnerability in these systems that could have serious implications. They have described this vulnerability as an ""inception layer"" that can be inserted between a user's VR Home Screen and their VR User/Server. The team has published a paper outlining their research and findings on the arXiv preprint server.

The concept behind this vulnerability revolves around the idea of hackers adding an app to a user's VR headset that tricks them into revealing sensitive information. This app creates a layer between the user and the virtual world they see through their VR device, hence the term ""inception layer."" The researchers drew inspiration from the movie ""Inception,"" where a character's reality is altered through a downloaded layer. In this scenario, the inception layer allows hackers to record information, intercept and modify data, and even manipulate the user's perception of the virtual world.

One example of the potential harm that could be caused by this vulnerability is the ability to record a passcode entered into a virtual ATM. The hackers could also modify the amount of money designated for a purchase and redirect the difference to their own bank account. Additionally, they could introduce virtual characters that represent the user's friends or family, using this ruse to gain trust and access to confidential information. Essentially, this app has the power to monitor and manipulate the user's gestures, voice, browsing activity, and social or business interactions.

To understand the extent of this vulnerability, the researchers conducted an experiment involving 28 volunteers who played a game using a demonstration VR headset. They downloaded the app onto the devices to simulate a hacking scenario and then asked the volunteers if they had noticed anything unusual. Although there was a slight flickering during the download and activation process, only 10 of the volunteers noticed it, and just one of them questioned whether something malicious was happening.

Upon discovering this vulnerability, the research team promptly informed Meta, the manufacturer of the Meta Quest VR system used in the experiment. Meta responded by stating that they would investigate the issue and take steps to address and rectify it if necessary. The researchers emphasize that vulnerabilities like this are likely to exist in other systems and apps that attempt to insert themselves between users and their VR devices.

This discovery serves as a wake-up call for the VR industry and highlights the need for robust security measures to protect users from potential attacks. As virtual reality continues to evolve and become more integrated into our lives, it is crucial that we address these vulnerabilities and ensure the safety and privacy of users. By raising awareness about this issue, we can work towards creating a more secure virtual reality environment for everyone.

In conclusion, the University of Chicago research team has shed light on a potential vulnerability in virtual reality systems. Through the use of an inception layer, hackers could manipulate users and extract sensitive information. The team's findings have prompted Meta to investigate the issue, and it serves as a reminder that security measures must be a priority in the development of VR technology. As we move forward, it is imperative that we address these vulnerabilities to protect users and create a safer virtual reality experience for all.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/vulnerability-in-virtu.jpg,2024-03-25 10:20:02,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/can-you-hear-me-now-ai-coustics-to-fight-noisy-audio-with-generative-ai/,Can you hear me now? AI-coustics to fight noisy audio with generative AI,"Can you hear me now? AI-coustics to fight noisy audio with generative AI

Noisy recordings of interviews and speeches can be a real headache for audio engineers. But a German startup called AI-coustics aims to solve this problem using a unique technical approach that leverages generative AI to enhance the clarity of voices in videos.

Recently, AI-coustics emerged from stealth mode with €1.9 million in funding. According to Fabian Seipel, the co-founder and CEO of AI-coustics, their technology goes beyond standard noise suppression and can work across any device and speaker.

Seipel, who has a background in audio engineering, co-founded AI-coustics with Corvin Jaedicke, a machine learning lecturer at the Technical University of Berlin, in 2021. The idea for AI-coustics came to them while they were studying audiotechnology at TU Berlin and encountered poor audio quality in online courses and tutorials.

Their mission is to improve the audio quality of digital interactions, whether it's a conference call, consumer device, or casual social media video. ""While my hearing is slightly impaired from music production in my early twenties, I've always struggled with online content and lectures, which led us to work on the speech quality and intelligibility topic in the first place,"" Seipel explained.

The market for AI-powered noise-suppressing and voice-enhancing software is already quite robust. AI-coustics faces competition from companies like Insoundz, which uses generative AI to enhance streamed and pre-recorded speech clips, and Veed.io, a video editing suite with tools to remove background noise from clips.

However, AI-coustics claims to have a unique approach to developing the AI mechanisms that perform the noise reduction work. They use a model trained on speech samples recorded in their Berlin studio. People are paid to record these samples, which are then added to a dataset to train AI-coustics' noise-reducing model. Additionally, they have developed a unique approach to simulate audio artifacts and problems during the training process.

It's worth noting that some may take issue with AI-coustics' one-time compensation scheme for creators, as the model they are training could potentially be lucrative in the long run. The debate over whether creators of training data for AI models deserve residuals for their contributions is ongoing. Another concern is bias, as speech recognition algorithms have been known to develop biases that harm users. To combat this, AI-coustics is focusing on recruiting ""diverse"" speech sample contributors to eliminate bias and ensure the technology works for all languages, speaker identities, ages, accents, and genders.

To test the effectiveness of AI-coustics' technology, I uploaded three video clips to their platform: an interview with an 18th-century farmer, a car driving demo, and an Israel-Palestine conflict protest. AI-coustics delivered on its promise of boosting clarity, with the processed clips having significantly less ambient background noise.

AI-coustics envisions their technology being used for real-time speech enhancement as well as recorded speech, and potentially being embedded in devices like soundbars, smartphones, and headphones to automatically improve voice clarity. Currently, AI-coustics offers a web app and API for post-processing audio and video recordings, as well as an SDK to integrate their platform into existing workflows, apps, and hardware.

The startup currently has five enterprise customers and 20,000 users, although not all of them are paying customers. They generate revenue through a mix of subscriptions, on-demand pricing, and licensing. Their plans for the future include expanding their team and improving the underlying speech-enhancing model.

With AI-coustics' innovative approach to noise reduction and voice enhancement, we may soon see significant improvements in the audio quality of digital communications. Whether it's a conference call, a video chat, or a social media video, AI-coustics aims to make every interaction as clear as a professional studio broadcast.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1009979808.jpg?resize=1200,801",2024-03-25 18:43:01,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/gostudent-tutoring-profitability/,"GoStudent, the online learning platform, says it's now profitable","GoStudent, the online tutoring marketplace based in Vienna, Austria, has become one of the largest and most popular startups in the country. With 11 million families and 23,000 tutors on its platform, the company has recently achieved profitability. According to CEO Felix Ohswald, GoStudent is not only EBITDA profitable, but also has positive operating cashflow.

GoStudent is among the few Austrian startups that have gained recognition in the international tech scene, alongside Bitpanda and Runtastic. Despite its success, the company faced challenges during the market crash for online learning and other technology companies. Cash burn became a major issue, and customer demand sharply declined. In 2021, GoStudent lost €89 million, which increased to €220 million in 2022, leading to layoffs and cost cuts.

The company experienced rapid growth but also significant cash burn. Ohswald described this period as ""crazy"" hyperscaling, with over €150 million burned in 2022 alone. However, as the market changed, GoStudent realized it needed to reduce its burn rate. In 2023, the company cut its expenses by 70%, but this was still not enough. In January of this year, Ohswald confirmed another round of layoffs, marking the third since 2022.

Despite these challenges, GoStudent benefited from the digital transformation brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. The demand for online tutoring increased, making GoStudent the go-to solution for students in need of educational help. However, the company still needed to address its cash burn issue. It made cuts in non-essential areas such as parties and acquisitions, and focused on established markets in Europe.

GoStudent's goal is to become the leading global school and unlock the potential of every student through personalized tutoring. While it currently offers tutoring services, its acquisition of Studienkreis in 2022 indicates a shift towards a more comprehensive educational approach. Studienkreis has physical learning centers, and GoStudent plans to leverage them for hybrid learning.

Ohswald believes that the future of education is hybrid, and GoStudent aims to provide personalized tutoring regardless of location. Most of GoStudent's tutors are university students, which makes it easier for them to connect with pupils. The company plans to continue scaling while keeping costs in check, striking a balance between growth and personalized education.

In conclusion, GoStudent has overcome financial challenges and achieved profitability. It plans to focus on organic growth in Europe and leverage technology for personalized tutoring. With its mission to become the global leader in education, GoStudent is poised to make a significant impact in the online tutoring market.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Founders-of-GoStudent-Gregor-Muller-I-Felix-Ohswald-2.jpg?w=1024,2024-03-25 11:00:36,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/spotify-courses-learning/,Spotify tests video courses to teach everything from music production to Excel,"Spotify, known for its music streaming, podcast entertainment, and audiobooks, is now venturing into the world of e-learning. In an effort to increase user engagement and revenue, Spotify is testing the waters with freemium video courses in the U.K. These courses, produced in partnership with third-party providers such as the BBC and Skillshare, offer at least two free lessons, with the option to purchase complete courses for an average price ranging from £20 to £80.

The courses will be accessible through Spotify's home and browse tabs, as well as through the Spotify mobile app. They cover a wide range of subjects, including music production, Excel tutorials, and even lessons on how to create online learning content. While there are already numerous online learning platforms available, Spotify's focus is on one-directional, on-demand video content. Some courses may include supplementary materials, but for now, there are no interactive elements or gamification features.

Spotify has partnered with Skillshare, PLAYvirtuoso, BBC Maestro, and Thinkific to offer a curated selection of courses. The selection process is based on what users are already listening to and searching for on the platform. Revenue from course sales will be shared among the creators, publishers, and Spotify, with content partners handling payments to the creators. The specifics of the revenue share and potential discounts for premium Spotify subscribers have not been disclosed.

This move into education is part of Spotify's broader strategy to diversify its business and improve profitability. While the company has faced financial challenges in the past, including layoffs and quarterly losses, it sees potential in the online learning and professional development market. Spotify has noticed a correlation between popular podcasts and education content, with around half of Spotify Premium subscribers listening to education-themed podcasts. By cross-promoting courses through podcasts, Spotify hopes to drive sales and engagement.

The decision to launch in the U.K. is based on the country's significant market size and high user engagement. Spotify aims to learn from user interests and preferences and expand its course offerings accordingly. Although Spotify is primarily known for music streaming, this foray into e-learning aligns with its goal of offering diverse content and appealing to a broader audience.

In conclusion, Spotify's entry into the e-learning space demonstrates its commitment to expanding its business and increasing user engagement. By offering freemium video courses in partnership with third-party providers, Spotify hopes to tap into the growing demand for online learning. With its extensive podcasting data, Spotify can leverage recommendations to cross-promote courses and podcasts. While the success of this venture remains to be seen, Spotify's move into education signals a strategic shift toward diversification and profitability.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Courses-on-Spotify-PR-Image-6-2.png?resize=1200,683",2024-03-25 08:59:18,Innovation,Innovation
