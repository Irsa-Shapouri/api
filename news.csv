https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-liquid-iron-battery-grid-energy.html,New all-liquid iron flow battery for grid energy storage,"Flow batteries holds tremendous potential for large-scale energy storage and the integration of renewable energy sources into the electric grid. In a recent breakthrough, researchers at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have repurposed a commonplace chemical used in water treatment facilities to create a new battery design that is safe, economical, and water-based.

The iron-based flow battery developed by the researchers utilizes a unique liquid chemical formula called nitrogenous triphosphonate, or NTMPA, which combines charged iron with a neutral-pH phosphate-based liquid electrolyte. What sets this battery apart from previous designs is the use of NTMPA, which is commercially available in industrial quantities. Typically used to inhibit corrosion in water treatment plants, NTMPA is a cost-effective and widely accessible material.

The team's lab-scale battery demonstrated remarkable cycling stability over one thousand consecutive charging cycles, retaining 98.7% of its maximum capacity. This is a significant improvement compared to previous studies, which reported degradation of charge capacity over a significantly lower number of cycles.

Flow batteries operate by storing energy in chemical bonds within two chambers filled with different liquids. These batteries charge through an electrochemical reaction and release energy when connected to an external circuit. Unlike traditional batteries, flow batteries feature two external supply tanks constantly circulating liquid electrolyte, serving as the battery system's ""blood supply."" The larger the electrolyte supply tank, the more energy the flow battery can store.

The advantages of flow batteries are numerous. They can serve as backup generators for the electric grid and provide a way to store energy from renewable sources such as wind and solar power. Flow batteries can be built at any scale, making them versatile for various applications. In the near term, grid operators are considering locating battery energy storage systems (BESS) in urban or suburban areas near energy consumers. The use of aqueous flow batteries, like the one developed by the researchers, offers the advantage of operating in water at neutral pH, addressing safety concerns.

The initial design of the iron-based flow battery achieved an energy density of up to 9 watt-hours per liter (Wh/L). Although this falls short of commercialized vanadium-based systems, which have an energy density of 25 Wh/L, the use of Earth-abundant materials allows for scalability to achieve the same energy output.

The development of flow batteries using NTMPA is a significant step forward in the quest for efficient and sustainable energy storage. By repurposing a commonplace chemical, the researchers have unlocked the potential for large-scale energy storage that is safe, economical, and environmentally friendly. This breakthrough paves the way for the integration of renewable energy sources into the nation's electric grid, bringing us closer to a more sustainable and decarbonized future.

In conclusion, the iron-based flow battery developed by researchers at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory offers a promising solution for large-scale energy storage. By utilizing a commonplace chemical used in water treatment facilities, the team has created a battery design that is safe, economical, and water-based. This breakthrough opens up new possibilities for the integration of renewable energy sources into the electric grid, bringing us one step closer to a sustainable future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/new-all-liquid-iron-fl.jpg,2024-03-25 07:22:25,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/carriemccabe/2024/03/26/is-esg-the-toxic-wordle-in-asset-management/,Is ESG The Toxic Wordle In Asset Management?,"In a recent article titled ""It's not just 'woke.' These are the most polarizing words in America,"" the CEO of the Harris Poll and vice chair of Stagwell discuss how certain words have become divisive and damaging to business. The words ""DEI"" and ""ESG"" are highlighted as the most polarizing, with a 31 percent and 27 percent partisan split, respectively. The authors even introduce a new term, ""toxic wordle,"" to describe these harmful business words and phrases.

Despite the cleverness of the term ""toxic wordle,"" there seems to be a softening of stances around DEI and ESG in asset management since the Supreme Court's affirmative action ruling in June '23. However, there is still a great deal of confusion surrounding the meaning of terms like ESG and sustainability. To provide some clarity, this article highlights four examples of concept and fact clarity from reputable sources in the industry.

First, Morningstar reports that sustainable investing had a poor performance in 2023 due to political scrutiny in the US. Investors withdrew over $13 billion from sustainable funds, with equity funds experiencing the worst underperformance. This indicates a weak demand for sustainable investing this year.

Next, ASC Advisors analyzed the top 50 hedge funds in their report ""ESG & The Top 50 Hedge Funds 2024."" They found that 44 percent of these funds are signatories to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), showing a strong focus on ESG. However, this number is slightly lower than the previous year's 52 percent.

Goldman Sachs conducted a survey called ""Staying the Course in Private Markets"" where they gathered views from over 200 limited partners (LPs) and general partners (GPs) on sustainability in the alternative investment landscape. The survey revealed that sustainability is a growing focus in the EMEA region, but less embraced in the Americas, with 24 percent of LPs reporting it was not a priority. The report also notes that those who embrace sustainability see it as a combination of financial and stakeholder focus.

Lastly, Lawrence Cunningham, founder of Quality Shareholders Group, discusses the politicization of ESG proposals. He notes that support for progressive social proposals has declined after reaching record levels in 2022 and 2023. Shareholders may be expressing their discontent with the politicization of business, as proposals are becoming more extreme than what organizations like the United Nations recommend in their PRI. On the other hand, there has been an increase in conservative proposals, which also receive little support.

In a time of political tension, it is crucial for businesses to clearly communicate their intentions. Loose use of acronyms and labels only adds to the confusion surrounding ESG and sustainability. To combat this ambiguity, this article has provided examples of concept and fact clarity from reputable sources.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660238a100b26c8097e589d7/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-26 02:41:59,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-co8322-sustainable-fuel.html,Research lights up process for turning CO₂ into sustainable fuel,"Researchers from the University of Nottingham, University of Birmingham, University of Queensland, and University of Ulm have made a breakthrough in transforming carbon dioxide (CO2) into methanol using sunlight and copper atoms. By anchoring copper on nanocrystalline carbon nitride, the team was able to facilitate the movement of electrons from the carbon nitride to CO2, a crucial step in the production of methanol. This discovery has significant implications for the development of green fuels.

Photocatalysis is a process in which light is directed at a semiconductor material, exciting electrons and allowing them to react with CO2 and water to produce various useful products, such as methanol. However, this process has historically suffered from low efficiency and selectivity. 

Carbon dioxide is a major contributor to global warming, and while it is possible to convert CO2 into useful products, traditional methods rely on hydrogen obtained from fossil fuels. Therefore, it is crucial to explore alternative methods that utilize solar energy and water, making use of photo- and electrocatalysis.

Dr. Madasamy Thangamuthu, a research fellow from the University of Nottingham, explained the importance of utilizing efficient photocatalysts: ""There is a wide range of materials used in photocatalysis, and it is crucial for the photocatalyst to absorb light and separate charge carriers efficiently. Our approach focuses on controlling the material at the nanoscale, using a new form of carbon nitride with crystalline nanoscale domains that enable efficient light interaction and charge separation.""

To optimize the functional properties of carbon nitride for photocatalysis, the team heated it to a specific degree of crystallinity. They then used magnetron sputtering to deposit atomic copper directly onto the semiconductor material, allowing for intimate contact between the copper atoms and the carbon nitride.

The researchers discovered that even without copper, the new form of carbon nitride was 44 times more active than traditional carbon nitride. However, the addition of just 1 mg of copper per 1 g of carbon nitride increased the efficiency fourfold. Importantly, this addition also changed the selectivity from methane, another greenhouse gas, to methanol, a valuable green fuel.

Professor Andrei Khlobystov from the University of Nottingham emphasized the sustainability of the catalyst materials, stating, ""Carbon dioxide valorization is crucial for achieving the UK's net-zero ambition. Ensuring the sustainability of our catalyst materials for this important reaction is of utmost importance. The new catalyst is advantageous as it consists of sustainable elements—carbon, nitrogen, and copper—all of which are abundantly available on our planet.""

This breakthrough represents a significant advancement in understanding photocatalytic materials for CO2 conversion. It opens up possibilities for creating highly selective and customizable catalysts by controlling the catalyst at the nanoscale.

This research has the potential to revolutionize the production of green fuels and contribute to efforts in combating climate change. By harnessing the power of sunlight and utilizing abundant and sustainable elements, such as carbon and copper, researchers have taken a crucial step towards a greener future.

Noisy recordings of interviews and speeches can be a major headache for audio engineers. However, a German startup called AI-coustics aims to solve this problem using generative AI technology to enhance the clarity of voices in video. Recently, AI-coustics emerged from stealth mode with €1.9 million in funding. According to Fabian Seipel, the co-founder and CEO of AI-coustics, their technology goes beyond standard noise suppression and works across any device and speaker.

Seipel, who is an audio engineer by training, started AI-coustics in collaboration with Corvin Jaedicke, a lecturer in machine learning at the Technical University of Berlin, in 2021. The two founders encountered poor audio quality in online courses and tutorials during their time at TU Berlin, which motivated them to work on improving speech quality and intelligibility.

The market for AI-powered noise-suppressing and voice-enhancing software is already robust, with competitors like Insoundz and Veed.io. However, AI-coustics distinguishes itself with a unique approach to developing the AI mechanisms for noise reduction. The startup trains its model on speech samples recorded in its own studio in Berlin. People are paid to record samples, which are then added to the data set used to train AI-coustics' noise-reducing model. 

AI-coustics has also developed a unique approach to simulate audio artifacts and problems during the training process, such as noise, reverberation, compression, and distortion. This helps the model learn to effectively reduce these issues in real-world scenarios.

While AI-coustics' compensation scheme for creators may raise some concerns, the startup is focused on recruiting diverse speech sample contributors to combat bias. Seipel believes that size and diversity are key to eliminating bias and ensuring the technology works for all languages, speaker identities, ages, accents, and genders.

To test the effectiveness of AI-coustics' technology, I uploaded three video clips to their platform: an interview with an 18th-century farmer, a car driving demo, and an Israel-Palestine conflict protest. The processed clips had significantly reduced ambient background noise, delivering on AI-coustics' promise of boosting clarity.

Seipel envisions AI-coustics' technology being used for real-time as well as recorded speech enhancement. It could be embedded in devices like soundbars, smartphones, and headphones to automatically enhance voice clarity. Currently, AI-coustics offers a web app and API for post-processing audio and video recordings, as well as an SDK for integrating their platform into existing workflows, apps, and hardware.

AI-coustics currently has five enterprise customers and 20,000 users, with a mix of subscriptions, on-demand pricing, and licensing as their revenue streams. The company plans to expand its team and improve its speech-enhancing model in the coming months.

AI-coustics' innovative approach to noise reduction using generative AI shows promise in improving audio quality in various applications. With their focus on inclusivity and combating bias, they aim to make their technology accessible to a wide range of users. As they continue to grow and refine their product, AI-coustics has the potential to revolutionize the way we experience audio in digital communications.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1009979808.jpg?resize=1200,801",2024-03-25 18:43:01,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-strategy-suppress-strain-propagation-ultrahigh.html,A strategy to suppress strain propagation in ultrahigh-Ni cathodes during fast charging,"To support the growing demand for electric vehicles and advancements in the electronics industry, researchers are focusing on developing improved battery technologies. One promising approach involves using nickel-rich layered oxides as cathode materials in lithium-ion batteries (LiBs). These cathodes offer several advantages, including increased battery capacity, improved rate capabilities, and decreased fabrication costs. However, they also have limitations such as capacity degradation and structural instability during fast-charging and long-term cycling.

To address these limitations, researchers from Argonne National Laboratory and other institutes worldwide have introduced a new strategy outlined in a paper published in Nature Energy. This strategy involves using epitaxial entropy-assisted oxide coating to suppress strain propagation, which is the main cause of structural deterioration in cathodes during fast-charging and prolonged cycling.

The researchers designed a specialized oxide coating that aligns with the structure of nickel-rich cathodes. These coatings not only enhance the robustness of the cathode materials' surface but also improve ionic conductivity, enabling faster charging of batteries. The coating is based on Wadsley-Roth crystallographic shear phases, which have been found to enhance electrode performance in LiBs. These compounds adhere well to nickel-rich cathodes, strengthening their structural stability during prolonged operation and fast-charging.

Through a series of experiments, the researchers coated nickel-rich layered cathodes and tested their performance over time and under different conditions. The results were highly promising, as the coating significantly reduced damage to the cathodes, even during fast-charging and after numerous operation cycles.

The researchers believe that this epitaxial entropy-assisted coating strategy opens up new opportunities for surface engineering in the design and development of high-energy and high-power LiBs and beyond.

In conclusion, the use of nickel-rich layered oxides as cathode materials in LiBs has shown great potential for improving battery performance. The introduction of epitaxial entropy-assisted oxide coating provides a promising solution to address the limitations of these cathodes, such as capacity degradation and structural instability. By aligning the coating with the cathode structure and enhancing ionic conductivity, researchers have achieved improved robustness, fast-charging capabilities, and overall battery performance. This innovative coating strategy has the potential to revolutionize the design and development of advanced LiBs and contribute to the widespread adoption of electric vehicles.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/a-strategy-to-suppress.jpg,2024-03-25 09:40:01,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/fisker-trading-suspended-by-nyse/,Fisker trading suspended by NYSE,"The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) made a significant announcement on Monday, declaring its immediate suspension of trading shares of electric vehicle (EV) startup Fisker. Furthermore, the NYSE is taking steps to remove the company from its stock exchange.

The NYSE asserted that Fisker's stock is no longer suitable for listing due to its ""abnormally low"" price levels. This decision comes after the NYSE warned Fisker last month that its stock price had spent 30 consecutive days trading below $1, rendering it non-compliant with the exchange's regulations.

While Fisker has the opportunity to review the NYSE's determination, the company stated in a filing on Monday afternoon that it anticipates its stock to be transferred to an over-the-counter market, such as OTC Pink. Fisker also revealed that the delisting has triggered repayment clauses in two outstanding loans that it is currently unable to afford. This situation could have a ""material adverse effect"" on the business.

The suspension of trading marked a turbulent day for Fisker. Prior to the halt in trading, the company's shares had plummeted by over 28%. In addition, Fisker disclosed earlier on Monday that it had lost a potential deal with a major automaker, rumored to be Nissan. This development has also jeopardized a recently announced attempt to secure emergency funding.

Fisker did not provide an explanation for the termination of negotiations with the automaker, which was a critical condition for the potential $150 million convertible note announced last week. In its filing, Fisker expressed its intention to request that the unnamed investor waive the closing condition.

Fisker has been grappling with numerous problems over the past few months, including customer complaints, lawsuits, and federal investigations. The beleaguered EV startup has faced challenges in selling its Ocean SUV, falling short of its internal sales targets, as previously reported by TechCrunch in January. To boost sales, Fisker shifted from a direct sales model to using dealerships. However, the company has struggled to address quality issues, as indicated by internal documents.

In February, Fisker laid off around 200 employees, constituting 15% of its workforce, and recently disclosed having only $121 million in its bank account. The company has halted production and warned investors that it would not survive another year without a fresh injection of capital.

Please note that this story has been updated to incorporate details from Fisker's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday afternoon.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fisker-GettyImages.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-25 21:06:18,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2024/03/25/generative-ai-can-create-just-about-everything-but-will-it-ever-create-jobs/,Generative AI Can Create Just About Everything-But Will It Ever Create Jobs?,"Generative AI: The Future of Work and Its Implications

As we reflect on the advancements made in generative AI over the past year, it becomes evident that this technology, which has proven its ability to write letters, reports, and even movie scripts, is now posing a threat to certain job positions. IBM recently announced downsizing in its marketing and communications team, attributing it in part to generative AI. Moreover, a survey revealed that more than one-third of companies using AI reported that it had replaced workers in 2023, with 44% anticipating further layoffs in 2024.

The question we must now ask ourselves is no longer centered around the capabilities of generative AI, but rather how human workers can remain relevant in a post-gen-AI world. As we face a future defined by AI, it is crucial for us as workers in the global economy to accept that efficiency will always be a driving force in business. Similar to how automation revolutionized manufacturing jobs, AI is set to take over many white-collar jobs, including those in marketing. Business executives are driven by the desire to maximize profits, and any technology that allows them to work faster, create more, and gain deeper insights is seen as a positive development. Research indicates that by 2030, approximately one-third of the hours currently worked in the US economy could be automated, thanks in part to generative AI.

While generative AI may eliminate certain job roles, it also has the potential to create new and unexpected opportunities. However, it is unlikely that every job lost will be replaced by a more advanced role in the same field. The work landscape is likely to undergo significant changes, and it is crucial for individuals to adapt and acquire new AI skills. Embracing the ""AI mentality"" behind automation and data-oriented value creation will be essential as we continue to advance in generative AI and future technologies. Becoming a programmer may no longer guarantee job security, as NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang suggests in recent interviews.

So, which job roles are most likely to experience a significant reduction due to generative AI? Here is a list of the top 10 roles that AI can streamline, resulting in 50-80% fewer full-time equivalents (FTEs):

1. Website and copy development
2. Marketing automation
3. Sales and sales development representatives
4. Basic legal support for personal and business tax filing and basic business accounting
5. Customer service L1/L2
6. Light coding and application development
7. Social media content and press releases
8. Inventory management and optimization
9. HR and talent management and identification

This is not an exhaustive list, but for startups and small businesses, the continuous development of vertical AI and LLM capabilities will enable significant productivity and efficiency gains while reducing personnel costs. OpenAI's Sam Altman even suggests that in the future, single-person billion-dollar companies could become a reality. While this may seem improbable, it is increasingly likely that 10-20 person companies could generate over $100 million in revenue and potentially reach a billion with the smart use of generative AI and intelligent chatbots.

Generative AI has the potential to be both a competitor and a friend. Individuals with limited design or writing skills can now use AI to create stunning graphic layouts, write letters, reports, and marketing campaigns. Additionally, AI can analyze the success of these campaigns in real-time and make necessary adjustments. It is true that generative AI is not perfect and may sometimes produce flawed results, but it is continuously improving at an impressive rate as technology and algorithms advance.

To remain relevant in a world where AI is capable of performing various tasks, it is crucial to stay engaged. Although it may be tempting to let AI do all the work, resisting this temptation is important. While AI can handle certain tasks, it cannot replicate human creativity, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence. By staying actively involved and leveraging these uniquely human qualities, individuals can continue to contribute value in a world increasingly driven by generative AI.

In conclusion, generative AI is reshaping the future of work, presenting both risks and opportunities. Its ability to automate tasks and generate content at an unprecedented pace has already led to job losses in various industries. However, it is essential to recognize that this technology also has the potential to create new roles and opportunities. As we navigate this rapidly evolving landscape, staying adaptable, acquiring new skills, and embracing the possibilities brought forth by generative AI will be key to remaining relevant and thriving in the workforce of tomorrow.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660212b5f2d67f4b8ae63aa3/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 20:24:50,Innovation,Innovation

Lithium-ion batteries have played a crucial role in the development of mobile electronics, enabling the creation of compact devices that can easily fit in our pockets. Despite their widespread use in various applications such as smartphones, laptops, and electric vehicles, these batteries still face challenges, particularly in terms of energy density. The components of lithium-ion batteries limit their energy density, which has prompted researchers to explore alternative materials to overcome these limitations.

One such promising alternative is lithium metal, which has the potential to enhance energy density within the anode by a factor of ten. However, the reactive nature of lithium metal poses significant challenges that require innovative control measures. One such measure is applying external pressure to the battery. While the impact of external pressure on cell performance is known, there is limited research on its relationship with the electroplating of lithium in large-format pouch cells to enhance overall battery performance.

To address this gap, the team at Texas A&M University focused on understanding the effects of pressure on lithium-metal anodes and its impact on lithium-ion distribution. By utilizing theoretical-computational techniques, they analyzed the precise effects of pressure on lithium-metal anodes. Through their research, they discovered that lithium ions tend to detour towards regions with elevated pressure or a higher concentration of lithium atoms on the surface. This behavior is driven by the electric field generated by the lithium-metal anode.

This finding has significant implications for the development of novel materials and their application in cutting-edge battery technologies. By understanding and predicting the behavior of lithium ions under pressure, researchers can enhance the fabrication processes of lithium-metal batteries, leading to cheaper infrastructure, longer battery life, and increased functionality.

Dr. Balbuena emphasizes the impact of this research beyond the field of battery technology. Similar methods can be applied to improve chemical and physical processes in various fields such as chemical engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, materials science, and biology. The ability to analyze the behavior of ions in different conditions opens up opportunities for advancements in multiple scientific disciplines.

In conclusion, the study conducted by Dr. Balbuena and Dr. Seminario sheds light on the effects of external pressure on lithium-metal batteries. Their research provides valuable insights into the behavior of lithium ions and paves the way for the development of longer-lasting and more efficient battery technologies. By utilizing quantum mechanics and computational techniques, they have demonstrated the potential for improved fabrication processes and the use of alternative materials in lithium-metal batteries. This research not only has implications for battery technology but also has broader applications in various scientific fields.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/new-discovery-can-lead.jpg,2024-03-25 17:06:08,Innovation,Innovation
