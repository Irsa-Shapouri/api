https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/24/new-whatsapp-warning-iphone-15-pro-max-samsung-s24-ultra-upgrade/,New WhatsApp Warning Suddenly Issued For 2 Billion Users,"WhatsApp's recent upgrade has generated a lot of buzz, but there's one feature that you should avoid at all costs. It has the potential to be quite dangerous, so it's important to be aware of the risks. In this blog post, we'll dive into the details of this feature and explain why you should steer clear of it.

Before we get into that, let's take a look at the current state of the messaging landscape. This year, we're expecting to see some major changes in the way we communicate. From iMessage adopting RCS to the integration of Gemini AI into Google Messages, the messaging world is evolving rapidly. However, many of these changes have led to misconceptions about end-to-end encryption.

End-to-end encryption is a crucial aspect of messaging apps like iMessage, WhatsApp, and Signal. It ensures that your conversations are secure and private. In fact, WhatsApp recently warned users that third-party chats would not be as secure as WhatsApp-to-WhatsApp chats. The Department of Justice even raised concerns about Apple's iMessage security on Android, emphasizing the importance of full encryption. Despite the pressure from governments and security agencies, Facebook Messenger has also made end-to-end encryption the default setting.

With this in mind, it is surprising to see some media reports encouraging users to transfer their chats and chat history from WhatsApp to Telegram. While WhatsApp provides an export setting that allows you to transfer your chats to Telegram, it's important to note that Telegram does not offer end-to-end encryption by default. In fact, Kaspersky warned last year that Telegram chats are not secure unless you enable the ""secret chat"" option for each individual conversation.

Moving your chats from WhatsApp, which is end-to-end encrypted by default, to Telegram, which is not, poses a significant security risk. This is especially true for group chats that contain sensitive information from multiple users. WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption ensures that your messages are protected from outsiders, including the service owners. It requires no additional action from the user and provides a secure communication platform right from the start.

When Telegram first introduced the option to migrate WhatsApp chats, I warned users about the potential dangers of doing so. While it may seem tempting to switch platforms, it's important to consider the security and privacy implications. As Jake Moore from ESET advises, pulling content out of end-to-end encrypted messaging platforms removes the barriers that protect your messages. While accessibility is important, it should not come at the expense of security and privacy.

Telegram boasts easy cross-platform use and reduced smartphone storage, thanks to its cloud-based architecture. However, these features prioritize accessibility and convenience over full encryption. The security of your data on Telegram relies more on policy than technology.

Given these factors, I strongly urge you not to follow any advice that suggests switching from WhatsApp to Telegram. Despite the marketing claims, it's a step backward in terms of security. Additionally, there are other concerns surrounding Telegram, such as its lack of content controls and its use by organized criminals.

In conclusion, while WhatsApp's new upgrade is exciting, it's important to be cautious when exploring its features. The potential risks associated with transferring your chats to Telegram outweigh any perceived benefits. Stick with WhatsApp, a platform that prioritizes end-to-end encryption and ensures the security and privacy of your conversations.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65b41420a2b346798e66d370/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2207,1442,x681,y315,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 23:45:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/24/meet-the-apps-that-tell-you-when-to-take-your-eclipse-glasses-off/,Meet The Apps That Tell You When To Take Your Eclipse Glasses Off,"When it comes to knowing when to remove your solar eclipse glasses, it can be a bit confusing. There are a few factors to consider in order to make sure you have the best experience. Firstly, you need to be within the path of totality, which is a narrow band only 115 miles wide. Secondly, you need to have a clear sky in order to see the eclipse. And finally, you need to know when to take off your eclipse glasses to witness the sun's corona.

For many people, it's this last step that causes the most concern. But fear not, it's actually quite simple. You remove your eclipse glasses when it starts to get dark. If you're in the path of totality, the darkness will come quickly as the moon's shadow passes over you. It will be impossible to miss the moment. However, if you're not in the path of totality, it won't get dark at all, so you should keep your glasses on.

Nowadays, there are even smartphone apps available that can enhance your eclipse experience. These apps provide an immersive audio guide that tells you when to take off your eclipse glasses as totality begins. They also help you identify other phenomena to look out for, such as shadow bands, Baily's beads, and the diamond ring effect. These apps are best used with over-the-ear headphones to ensure you don't block out the people around you.

One such app is the ""Pro"" version of The Eclipse Company's app. It not only provides real-time weather updates and cloud forecasts for totality, but also includes a countdown timer with a vibration alert to safely remove your glasses. It even offers detailed information about local eclipse events. The app alerts you to when to look for eclipse phenomena, creating an immersive audio experience. However, it remains silent during totality.

Another popular app is the Solar Eclipse Timer App. It uses your location to determine if you're in the path of totality and guides you through the contact times. It also provides information on eclipse phenomena. This app was developed by eclipse chaser and educator Gordon Telepun, who has written a book called ""Eclipse Day: 2024 and More"" on Apple Books. It's particularly useful for photographers and even has a special ""Photographer's Mode"" developed with ex-NASA eclipse calculator and photographer Fred Espenak.

For iOS users, there's the One Eclipse app. Unfortunately, there is no Android version available. This app, created by the non-profit Astronomers Without Borders and Simulation Curriculum, allows you to simulate the eclipse from your location or anywhere else on Earth. It also includes an interactive map with precise eclipse event times and a dynamic Eclipse Countdown clock that features a simple audio timer for each phase of the eclipse. Additionally, this app supports a glasses recycling program for underserved communities worldwide.

So, if you're planning to witness a solar eclipse, make sure to follow these guidelines on when to remove your glasses. And if you want to enhance your experience, consider using one of these smartphone apps. They will not only help you stay safe, but also provide you with valuable information and make the event even more memorable.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have surprising similarities in their growth trajectories. Both companies discovered new revenue streams by capitalizing on their core businesses. AWS realized it could sell the services it created for itself, while Nvidia found that its gaming GPU was well-suited for AI workloads.

This realization led to explosive revenue growth for both companies. Nvidia's revenue grew from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024 to $22.1 billion in Q4 2024, primarily driven by its data center business. Although AWS didn't experience the same intense growth, it has consistently been a significant revenue driver for Amazon. However, as Microsoft and Google entered the market, the competition grew, and other chip makers are expected to gain market share in the future.

Both Nvidia and AWS were in the right place at the right time. The rise of web apps and mobile technology in the early 2010s created a demand for cloud services. Enterprises saw the value of moving workloads to the cloud instead of maintaining their own data centers. Similarly, the growth of AI and large language models coincided with the increased use of GPUs for processing these workloads.

While AWS has become a highly profitable business, its growth has started to slow down. On the other hand, Nvidia's growth is accelerating. However, the question remains whether Nvidia can sustain this growth and become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS. If the GPU market tightens, Nvidia has other smaller revenue generators, but they are growing at a slower rate than the data center business.

In the short term, Nvidia's revenue growth has been astronomical. The company anticipates $24 billion in revenue for its current quarter, a 234% increase compared to the same period last year. However, as the company's revenue ramp-up slows, its growth rate is expected to decline. Analysts project a more modest 8.6% growth rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the final quarter of fiscal 2024. Despite these declines, Nvidia is still expected to scale its revenue to over $100 billion annually for the next few quarters.

Looking ahead, AI could continue to drive growth for Nvidia in the coming years, despite increased competition from AMD, Intel, and other chipmakers. Like AWS, Nvidia will face stiffer competition in the future, but its current market dominance allows room for some competition. At the chip level, Nvidia is firmly in control, according to IDC. However, AMD is gaining ground at the board level, as reported by Jon Peddie Research.

In conclusion, both Nvidia and AWS have experienced significant growth by capitalizing on their core businesses. While AWS growth has slowed, Nvidia's growth is expected to continue, driven by the demand for AI processing. The competition may intensify in the future, but Nvidia's current market dominance positions it well for future success.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/24/see-the-moon-eclipsed-by-earth-as-americas-total-solar-eclipse-draws-near-the-night-sky-this-week/,See The Moon Begin Its ‘Eclipse Season:’ The Night Sky This Week,"The Night Sky This Week: March 25-31, 2024

North America is currently experiencing a golden age of eclipses, and this week's celestial event is a prelude to the much-anticipated total solar eclipse happening next week. In the early hours of Monday, March 25, the full worm moon will be partially eclipsed by Earth, resulting in a penumbral lunar eclipse. While it may not be a full ""blood moon"" eclipse, this moment is crucial because it sets the stage for the total solar eclipse on Monday, April 8, 2024. If you want to witness this awe-inspiring event, keep reading for some planning tips.

Aside from the eclipse, there are other exciting events happening in the night sky this week. As the week progresses, the waning gibbous moon will pass by a couple of bright stars, making the early evening skies perfect for stargazing by the weekend. Now, let's delve into the details of this week's cosmic wonders.

Monday, March 25: 'Worm Moon Lunar Eclipse'

On Monday, March 25, we will witness the third full moon of 2024, known as the ""Worm Moon."" This moon marks the onset of spring in the northern hemisphere and will pass through the Earth's outer shadow in space. As a result, a subtle penumbral lunar eclipse will occur on the night side of Earth, visible from North and South America, Europe, East Asia, Australia, and New Zealand.

In New York, the eclipse will begin at 00:53 a.m. EDT and end at 05:32 a.m. EDT, with the maximum eclipse occurring at 03:12 a.m. EDT. In Los Angeles, the eclipse will take place from 9:53 p.m. PDT to 02:32 a.m. PDT on Sunday, March 24, and Monday, March 25, respectively, with the maximum eclipse at 00:12 a.m. EDT.

Tuesday, March 26: Moon and Spica

After sunset on Tuesday, March 26, step outside and witness the almost full moon rising due east. However, there's something remarkable about this moonrise. Just to the top right of the rising moon, you'll notice the bright star Spica, the brightest star in the constellation Virgo and one of the 20 brightest stars in the night sky. It will be within 1.4 degrees of our natural satellite, creating a captivating celestial sight.

Saturday, March 30: Moon and Antares

If you find yourself awake late on Friday into the early hours of Saturday, look towards the southeast to catch a glimpse of the 78%-lit waning gibbous moon. It will be situated less than a degree away from Antares, a red supergiant star in the constellation Scorpius. This stunning conjunction will showcase the beauty of the night sky.

Galaxies of the Week: Bode's and the Cigar

Ursa Minor and Ursa Major, both visible in the northern sky after dark this week, are home to two captivating galaxies that are a treat for telescope enthusiasts. The first, M81, also known as Bode's galaxy, is a large spiral galaxy located approximately 12 million light-years away from Earth. It is one of the brightest galaxies in the night sky. The second, M82, also known as the Cigar galaxy, is a starburst galaxy situated about the same distance from Earth. It is renowned for its high rate of star formation and can be observed as small, diffuse patches of light northwest of the bright star Dubhe in the Big Dipper.

Eclipse Tip of the Week: Preparing for the Total Solar Eclipse

Less than two weeks remain until one of the rarest and most breathtaking celestial events occurs in North America—a total solar eclipse. If you haven't made solid plans yet, now is the time to act. Remember, to experience the full wonder of the eclipse, you must be within the path of totality (the yellow stripe on the map provided). Merely getting close to it will not provide the same awe-inspiring experience. Fortunately, there are numerous resources available to assist you in finding the best places to stay and view the eclipse. Check out the plethora of articles on my feed or visit websites that offer maps, simulations, and event listings.

To obtain the most accurate and location-specific information, consult online planetariums such as Stellarium and The Sky Live. These platforms provide details regarding planet-rise/planet-set, sunrise/sunset, and moonrise/moonset times for your specific location. Remember to keep your eyes peeled and hope for clear skies as you embark on this cosmic adventure.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/techcrunch-mobility-the-wheels-are-starting-to-come-off-the-fisker-ev-bus/,TechCrunch Mobility: The wheels are starting to come off the Fisker EV bus,"TechCrunch Mobility is a weekly newsletter that covers all things transportation. In this edition, we'll discuss the recent proposed standards from the Biden Administration, Uber's first investment in Africa, an Apple antitrust suit related to cars, and DoorDash's partnership with Wing for drone delivery. Before we dive into the startup and tech news, let's touch on the new regulations set by the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that will impact U.S. automakers and consumers.

The DOE has introduced a gentler ""petroleum equivalency factor"" that assigns a score to electric vehicles (EVs) under the government's corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. The original proposal would have made it challenging for automakers to meet these standards, potentially leading to significant fines. However, the new regulations have been softened to accommodate the automotive industry, car dealers, and unions while still implementing stricter standards than before.

Meanwhile, the EPA has released tailpipe standards for 2027 to 2032 model year vehicles that impose more rigorous requirements on automakers. However, these standards allow flexibility in meeting the rules through different powertrain options. The regulations are technology-agnostic and do not exclusively require a shift to battery electric vehicles (EVs). This is a significant departure from the initial proposal, which aimed to have EV sales constitute 67% of the U.S. passenger vehicle market by 2032.

While these regulations have minimal impact on EV startups like Rivian, Tesla, and Lucid, as their vehicles already meet the clean car standards, legacy automakers are facing real challenges. These companies are investing billions in developing, manufacturing, and selling EVs while still generating profits from internal combustion engine vehicles. In this context, plug-in hybrids might emerge as the winners.

Now, let's move on to the latest news in the world of mobility. Rivian has announced a partnership with Tesla, which is an interesting development considering both companies are major players in the EV market. Additionally, Candela, an electric boat startup, raised $25 million in funding led by Groupe Beneteau. This investment will further drive the adoption of electric boats, contributing to the overall sustainability of the maritime industry.

Unfortunately, Fisker has been facing financial challenges, with continued fallout and struggles to secure new investments. On a brighter note, a startup called Amber has launched an aftermarket Tesla extended warranty product, raising $3.18 million in a seed round. This innovative offering will provide Tesla owners with additional peace of mind and protection for their vehicles.

Lastly, Uber has made its first investment in an Africa-founded startup called Moove. Moove is a mobility fintech company that offers vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers. The company raised $100 million in a Series B funding round, led by Uber. This investment aligns with Uber's commitment to achieving a fully zero-emission fleet by 2040 and highlights the company's interest in supporting sustainable mobility solutions around the world.

Welcome back, Wordle enthusiasts! It's the last week of March, and we're here to tackle another exciting puzzle. But before we dive into today's Wordle, let's take a moment to reflect on the weekend.

It was an interesting weekend, wasn't it? Just as we were all getting ready for the sunny and lovely spring season, Mother Nature decided to surprise us with half a foot of snow. It's cold and wintry outside, but you have to admit, it does make for a pretty sight.

Now, let's leave the snow behind and get back to work. It's time to Wordle! Are you ready? Let's do this!

How to Solve Today's Wordle:
Hint: Normally, we think of this as a proper noun.
Clue: Today's Wordle has a double letter.

Spoiler Alert!

And now, the moment you've been waiting for – the answer to today's Wordle.

[Insert Screenshot of Today's Wordle Solution]

Wordle Analysis:
Every day, I eagerly check Wordle Bot to see how I fared. It's always interesting to see how others approach the puzzle. If you haven't tried it yet, you can check your Wordles with Wordle Bot right here.

I must admit, today's Wordle had me scratching my head in confusion. I started off on the wrong foot, with so many possible solutions – a whopping 195, to be precise. But I didn't let that discourage me. I kept going.

Then, I stumbled upon the word ""allay,"" and it turned out to be a great guess. It led me to the realization that there was more than one 'L' in the solution, narrowing down my options to just one word. Almost falling into the trap of guessing ""palsy,"" I suddenly had an epiphany – I needed a second 'L.' After some brainstorming, I finally settled on ""sally,"" which I usually associate with a name. But little did I know that it also refers to a battle tactic from the past.

Competitive Wordle Score:
Unfortunately, today wasn't my lucky day. I didn't earn any points for guessing in four tries or tying with the Bot. It's a big, fat zero for me. But hey, that's part of the challenge, right?

The Etymology of ""Sally"":
Now, let's take a moment to explore the fascinating origins of the word ""sally"" in a non-proper noun context. Primarily, it means to suddenly rush forth or make a sudden attack from a defensive position. It can also mean to embark on a journey or venture.

The etymology of ""sally"" is quite intriguing, tracing back through several languages before arriving in English. It originated from the Middle French word ""sallie,"" which is the noun form of ""sallir,"" meaning ""to rush out, leap forth."" ""Sallir"" itself comes from the Latin word ""salire,"" which means ""to leap."" This Latin root has given rise to various related English words, such as ""salient"" (prominently projecting) and ""assail"" (to attack), reflecting the concept of movement or leaping forth.

So, the etymology of ""sally"" beautifully captures the essence of suddenness and unexpectedness, whether in a physical attack from a fortified position or in embarking on a new journey or venture.
