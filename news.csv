https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/03/25/understanding-the-implications-of-the-sec-incident-disclosure-rules/,Understanding The Implications Of The SEC Incident Disclosure Rules,"In December 2023, the SEC implemented new rules regarding cybersecurity risk management and incident disclosure for publicly traded companies. These rules require companies to disclose any ""material cybersecurity incidents"" they experience within four business days via Form 8-K. Additionally, companies are required to submit Form 10-K annually, disclosing their processes for assessing, identifying, and managing cybersecurity threats. These rules aim to promote transparency and ensure that companies are taking action to prevent or detect cyber incidents.

The SEC focuses on asking companies to state whether they are taking steps to manage cyber risk, rather than requiring specific details. This approach recognizes that such information could be proprietary and potentially helpful to malicious cyber actors. The SEC looks at factors such as how a company assesses cyber risk, whether they have learned from past incidents, and how executives and the board manage cyber risk.

While the SEC's intention is to inform investors, these reporting requirements are likely to lead to increased focus on cybersecurity across companies and industries. Companies that simply respond with ""none"" to the cyber preparation questions may find themselves unpopular with investors, business partners, and customers. The ability to compare publicly available 10-K information will drive expectations of due diligence in corporate cybersecurity.

Determining the ""materiality"" of a cyber incident requires collaboration among multiple participants within a company. Cyber experts analyze what happened, managers assess the operational impact, the CFO and general counsel determine if it's a material incident, and the CEO and board decide on the appropriate course of action. Collaboration is crucial, especially during significant cyber incidents.

Having a playbook for cyber incident response is a best practice. This playbook should cover worst-case scenarios as well as less catastrophic but still significant incidents that are more common in your industry. Conducting tabletop discussions and exercises can help the board and senior officers focus on the issue and refine the playbook based on lessons learned.

In the event of a material cyber incident, the response team may need to include both public and private sector partners. Federal organizations like the SEC provide guidance and expertise, and it's important to understand how they can assist in extending the four-day disclosure deadline or provide resources for assessing and improving your organization's security posture. Additionally, private sector partners such as digital forensics experts, incident response teams, and legal counsel can be valuable resources. Don't forget to consider the impact on key suppliers, business partners, and customers, as they should be involved in your incident response plans.

Overall, the new SEC rules shine a spotlight on corporate cybersecurity and require companies to be transparent about their cyber risk management efforts. Collaboration, preparedness, and engaging with both public and private sector partners are essential in managing cyber incidents effectively. By taking proactive measures and demonstrating a commitment to cybersecurity, companies can strengthen their cyber resilience and build trust with stakeholders.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fdc7969c762b0830a28aba/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 09:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-liquid-iron-battery-grid-energy.html,New all-liquid iron flow battery for grid energy storage,"A Common Chemical Repurposed for Large-Scale Energy Storage

Researchers at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have developed a new battery design that repurposes a commonplace chemical used in water treatment facilities. This design offers a safe, economical, and water-based flow battery made with Earth-abundant materials. It presents a promising solution for incorporating intermittent energy sources like wind and solar power into the nation's electric grid.

The researchers, led by battery researcher Gabriel Nambafu, conducted lab-scale experiments on an iron-based battery. They found that the battery exhibited remarkable cycling stability over one thousand consecutive charging cycles, while maintaining 98.7% of its maximum capacity. This is a significant improvement compared to previous studies, which reported degradation of the charge capacity over fewer charging cycles.

Iron-based flow batteries have been in existence since the 1980s and are already commercially available. However, what sets this battery apart is its unique liquid chemical formula. It combines charged iron with a neutral-pH phosphate-based liquid electrolyte, or energy carrier. The key ingredient in this chemical formula is nitrogenous triphosphonate, also known as nitrilotri-methylphosphonic acid or NTMPA. NTMPA is commercially available in large quantities because it is commonly used to inhibit corrosion in water treatment plants.

Phosphonates, including NTMPA, are a broad family of chemicals based on phosphorus. Many of these chemicals dissolve well in water and are used in various applications, such as fertilizers and detergents.

The development of new flow battery technologies is crucial for the modernization of the U.S. electric grid. These technologies provide a way to store energy from renewable sources like wind and solar power. The researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory are committed to using Earth-abundant materials that can be sourced domestically.

But what exactly is a flow battery? Flow batteries consist of two chambers, each filled with a different liquid. These batteries charge through an electrochemical reaction, storing energy in chemical bonds. When connected to an external circuit, they release the stored energy, which can power electrical devices. Unlike conventional batteries, flow batteries feature two external supply tanks of liquid that constantly circulate through them to supply the electrolyte, essentially serving as the battery system's ""blood supply."" The larger the electrolyte supply tank, the more energy the flow battery can store.

Flow batteries can be used as backup generators for the electric grid and are considered a key component of decarbonization strategies. They can be built at any scale, from lab-bench size to the size of a city block.

In the short term, grid operators are exploring the possibility of locating battery energy storage systems (BESS) in urban or suburban areas near energy consumers. However, safety concerns are often a consideration for city planners. The type of aqueous flow battery developed by the researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory could address these concerns.

""A BESS facility using the chemistry similar to what we have developed here would have the advantage of operating in water at neutral pH,"" says Aaron Hollas, a study author and team leader in PNNL's Battery Materials and Systems Group. ""In addition, our system uses commercially available reagents that haven't been previously investigated for use in flow batteries.""

The research team achieved an energy density of up to 9 watt-hours per liter (Wh/L) in their initial design. Commercialized vanadium-based systems, in comparison, have an energy density of over 25 Wh/L. Higher energy density batteries can store more energy in a smaller space, but a system built with Earth-abundant materials could be scaled to provide the same energy output.

The future development of flow battery technology holds great promise for the advancement of renewable energy storage. The research conducted by the team at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory brings us closer to achieving a sustainable and reliable electric grid powered by renewable energy sources. With further advancements in flow battery design and the use of Earth-abundant materials, we can expect significant progress in the field of energy storage and the integration of renewable energy into our daily lives.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/new-all-liquid-iron-fl.jpg,2024-03-25 07:22:25,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have more in common than one might expect. Both companies experienced significant growth due to their core businesses emerging from unexpected sources. AWS realized it could sell its internal services, such as storage and compute, while Nvidia discovered that its gaming GPU was well-suited for processing AI workloads.

This realization led to explosive revenue growth for both companies. Nvidia's revenue has tripled, going from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024 to $22.1 billion in Q4 2024. However, most of this growth came from its data center business. AWS, on the other hand, consistently drove revenue for Amazon, although it never experienced the same intense growth as Nvidia. Over time, Microsoft and Google entered the market, creating the Big Three cloud vendors, and other chip makers are expected to gain market share as well.

Both Nvidia and AWS were in the right place at the right time. As web apps and mobile technology emerged, the cloud provided on-demand resources, and enterprises saw the value of moving workloads to the cloud. Similarly, the rise of AI and large language models coincided with the increased use of GPUs for processing these workloads.

While AWS has become a tremendously profitable business, its growth has started to slow down, whereas Nvidia's growth is accelerating. This is partly due to the law of large numbers, which will eventually affect Nvidia as well. The question now is whether Nvidia can sustain its growth and become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS.

Nvidia does have other businesses aside from GPUs, but they are smaller revenue generators growing at a slower pace. However, in recent quarters, Nvidia's revenue growth has been astronomical. According to its recent earnings report, Nvidia expects $24 billion worth of revenue in its current quarter, a 234% increase compared to the same quarter a year ago. While its growth rate is expected to decline, analysts still anticipate significant growth for Nvidia in the coming years.

AI appears to be the key driver of growth for Nvidia, even as competition from AMD, Intel, and other chipmakers emerges. Nvidia currently controls a significant portion of the market, but competition will become stiffer in the future. Nevertheless, Nvidia is well-positioned to maintain its momentum.

In conclusion, Nvidia and AWS have experienced remarkable growth due to their core businesses aligning with emerging technologies. While AWS growth has slowed down, Nvidia's revenue continues to skyrocket. Both companies have benefited from being in the right place at the right time, and Nvidia's dominance in the chip market positions it well for future success. Despite the challenges of increased competition, Nvidia's focus on AI ensures that it remains a key player in the industry.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.zdnet.com/article/saving-hours-of-work-with-ai-how-chatgpt-became-my-virtual-assistant-for-a-data-project/,Saving hours of work with AI: How ChatGPT became my virtual assistant for a data project,"generative AI tools like ChatGPT have gained a lot of attention in recent times. They offer a range of possibilities and can be incredibly useful for various projects. In this article, I want to share with you how ChatGPT helped me save time and effort on a recent project. While the specifics may not directly apply to your work, I hope it will inspire you to explore the potential of ChatGPT for your own projects.

The project I worked on involved creating an article about how much computer gear I could buy from a website called Temu for under $100. It was a fun project that I knew would interest readers. To complete this task, I had to spend time on the Temu site, searching for items to feature in the article. For example, I found an iPad keyboard and mouse that cost around six dollars.

To stick to my $100 budget, I needed to gather all the Temu links, find the prices for each product, and rearrange things until I reached my desired total. However, converting the Temu links into a usable format was a challenge. This is where ChatGPT came to the rescue.

Phase 1: Gathering the links
The first step was to collect all the links. I copied each link from Temu and pasted it into a Notion page. Notion allows you to create bookmark blocks that not only contain links but also include the product names. Here's a snapshot of the page I created:

[Insert screenshot of the Notion page]

As you can see, I started selecting the blocks containing the links. Once I had selected them all, I copied the entire set and pasted it into a text editor that I had set to dark mode. The pasted blocks may not look pretty, but they were useful for further processing.

Phase 2: Identifying the data
Now let's take a closer look at one of the data blocks. I switched my editor out of dark mode so you can see the data elements within the block more clearly:

[Insert screenshot of the data block]

Within each block, there are three key elements. The gold text represents the product name, enclosed in braces. The green text is the base URL of the product, enclosed in parentheses. There's also a question mark that separates the main page URL from additional tracking data, which I didn't need. I only wanted the main URL. The purple sections highlight the delimiters that we will feed into ChatGPT for further processing.

Phase 3: Teaching ChatGPT to recognize the data
I started by feeding ChatGPT this prompt:
""Accept the following data and await further instructions.""

Then, I copied all the information from the text editor and pasted it into ChatGPT. At this point, ChatGPT knew to wait for more details.

The next step was crucial. I wanted ChatGPT to extract the titles and links from the data while disregarding the rest. Here's the prompt I used:

""The data above consists of a series of blocks of data. At the beginning of each block is a section within [] brackets. For each block, designate this as TITLE. Following the [] brackets is an open parenthesis (followed by a web URL). For each block, extract that URL, but disregard everything following the question mark, including the question mark itself. Most URLs will end in .html. We will designate this as URL. Display the TITLE followed by a carriage return, then the URL, and finally, two newlines.""

This process allowed me to name the data, making it easier to refer to later. It also served as a test to see if ChatGPT understood the assignment.

ChatGPT successfully completed the assignment but stopped when its buffer ran out. I prompted the bot to continue, and it provided the remaining data.

Doing this process manually would have been tedious and time-consuming. ChatGPT completed the task in a matter of moments.

Phase 4: Cleaning up Temu's complex titles
In my project, the titles provided by Temu were excessively long and detailed. For instance, instead of a title like ""10 Inch LCD Writing Tablet, Electronis Memo With Leather Protective Case, Electronic Drawing Board For Digital Handwriting Pad Doodle Board, Gifts For"", I preferred something simpler like ""LCD writing tablet with case.""

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-deep-geothermal-renewable-powerhouse.html,Dig deep: US bets on geothermal to become renewable powerhouse,"Geothermal energy is gaining attention as a promising source of clean and reliable power in the United States. While it currently represents a small fraction of the country's energy production, businesses and the Biden administration are investing in technological advancements to make geothermal energy a key player in the green transition.

Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm spoke about the potential of geothermal energy at the CERAWeek conference in Houston. She emphasized that harnessing the heat beneath our feet could provide clean and scalable power for industries and households alike. The Department of Energy estimates that geothermal energy could surpass hydroelectric and solar power in the US by 2050.

Geothermal energy taps into naturally high temperatures underground and is primarily used for electricity production and heating buildings. In 2022, geothermal accounted for only 1.6 percent of US energy consumption. To increase production, the US government has invested over $200 million since 2018 in an experimental site in Utah. This site utilizes Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), a technology that involves drilling exceptionally deep wells and injecting water into hot rocks to generate power.

EGS technology offers several advantages. It reduces upfront risks associated with drilling and exploration, making it more attractive to investors. Additionally, geothermal drilling does not release hydrocarbons like fracking does, and it requires fewer chemical additives. Unlike solar or wind power, geothermal energy provides a constant flow of energy regardless of weather conditions or time of day.

Moreover, the cost of geothermal energy is expected to decrease significantly. The US government estimates that the cost per megawatt hour (MWh) will drop from the current range of $70 to $100 to $45 by 2035. The use of existing drilling technology makes geothermal development quicker and more cost-effective.

The US has been at the forefront of geothermal technology, but other countries, including France, are also exploring EGS sites. While there is potential for seismic activity with geothermal drilling, the US Energy Department requires funded projects to follow mitigation protocols to address induced seismicity and is funding research on the issue.

The growing interest in geothermal energy has attracted investment from several start-ups in the US and Canada. These companies have raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors and are positioning themselves in this emerging market. For example, Fervo Energy has connected its Nevada site to the electric grid in collaboration with Google.

As the supply of geothermal energy expands, so does the demand. Major companies like Google, Microsoft, and Nucor are now purchasing geothermal energy. The willingness of these companies to pay a premium for clean energy excites the private sector and encourages further growth in the industry.

Cindy Taff, CEO of Sage Geosystems, believes that the geothermal market is still open for new players. The first successful commercial facility will pave the way for others to follow suit. With the sector still in its early stages, the primary objective is to establish sustainable growth.

Geothermal energy has the potential to transform the US energy landscape and contribute significantly to the green transition. With advancements in technology and increasing investment, geothermal power can become a reliable and clean source of energy for a sustainable future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/a-worker-operates-a-dr.jpg,2024-03-25 04:59:03,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-household-robots-common.html,Engineering household robots to have a little common sense,"Robots are becoming increasingly skilled at performing household tasks, from cleaning up spills to serving food. Many of these robots learn through imitation, copying the motions guided by a human. However, robots often struggle to handle unexpected situations or disruptions that deviate from their trained path. MIT engineers are working to give robots a sense of ""common sense"" by connecting robot motion data with large language models (LLMs).

The engineers have developed a method that allows robots to logically break down household tasks into subtasks and adjust to disruptions within a subtask. This means that robots can continue with their task without starting from scratch or requiring explicit programming for every potential failure. Yanwei Wang, a graduate student at MIT's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, explains that this method allows robots to self-correct errors and improve overall task success.

The researchers presented their approach in a study at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024) in May. The study's co-authors include Tsun-Hsuan Wang and Jiayuan Mao, graduate students in EECS, Michael Hagenow, a postdoc in MIT's Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and Julie Shah, a professor at MIT.

To demonstrate their approach, the researchers used the example of scooping marbles from one bowl and pouring them into another. Typically, engineers would physically guide a robot through the motions of scooping and pouring, providing multiple demonstrations for the robot to mimic. However, the team realized that a human demonstration consists of a continuous trajectory, while the task itself consists of a series of subtasks. For example, the robot must reach into the bowl before scooping and move the marbles to the empty bowl.

If a robot makes a mistake during any of these subtasks, it usually has to start from the beginning, unless engineers explicitly program fixes or collect new demonstrations for the robot to recover from the failure. To avoid this tedious planning process, the researchers turned to LLMs. These deep learning models process vast amounts of text and can generate new sentences based on the patterns they have learned. The researchers found that LLMs can produce a logical list of subtasks for a given task, such as reaching, scooping, transporting, and pouring for scooping marbles.

The researchers developed an algorithm to connect the LLM's natural language labels for subtasks with the robot's physical position or image. This process, known as ""grounding,"" allows the robot to understand its stage in a task and replan or recover autonomously. By mapping the robot's physical coordinates or image to natural language labels, the robot can make use of the LLM's instructions and adjust its actions accordingly.

This new approach enhances the capabilities of robots by allowing them to adapt to disruptions and self-correct errors. Instead of relying solely on human demonstrations, robots can leverage the knowledge and language models to navigate through complex tasks. The researchers believe that this method can be applied to various household tasks and improve the overall success of robot-assisted activities.

In conclusion, MIT engineers have developed a method that connects robot motion data with large language models to enhance the capabilities of household robots. This approach allows robots to logically break down tasks into subtasks, adjust to disruptions within a task, and self-correct errors. By leveraging natural language instructions and grounding techniques, robots can improve their overall task success and adapt to unexpected situations. This advancement brings robots one step closer to performing complex household tasks with ease and efficiency.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/engineering-household.jpg,2024-03-25 09:48:20,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-large-language-simple-mechanism-knowledge.html,Large language models use a surprisingly simple mechanism to retrieve some stored knowledge,"Large language models (LLMs) are complex tools used in various fields such as customer support, code generation, and language translation. However, scientists still have limited understanding of how these models work. To gain insight into their functioning, researchers from MIT and other institutions conducted a study on how LLMs retrieve and decode stored knowledge.

The study revealed an intriguing discovery: LLMs often employ a simple linear function to recover and decode stored facts. These linear functions, which involve two variables and no exponents, capture the straightforward relationship between variables. Surprisingly, the same decoding function is used for similar types of facts.

By identifying linear functions for different facts, researchers can explore the model to determine its knowledge about new subjects and where that knowledge is stored. Using a technique they developed to estimate these simple functions, the researchers found that even when a model provides an incorrect answer, it often retains the correct information. This approach could potentially help identify and rectify falsehoods within the model, reducing the likelihood of incorrect or nonsensical answers.

Evan Hernandez, an electrical engineering and computer science graduate student at MIT and co-lead author of the study, emphasized the significance of this finding. He highlighted that despite the complexity of these models, there are instances where simple mechanisms operate within them.

Hernandez collaborated with co-lead author Arnab Sharma, a computer science graduate student at Northeastern University, as well as other researchers from MIT, Harvard University, and the Israeli Institute of Technology. Their findings will be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024).

Most large language models, including transformer models, are neural networks composed of interconnected nodes or neurons grouped into layers. These models store knowledge as relations that connect subjects and objects. For example, the relation ""Miles Davis plays the trumpet"" connects the subject (Miles Davis) to the object (trumpet).

As the transformer acquires more knowledge, it stores additional facts about a given subject across multiple layers. When a user queries the model about a subject, it must decode the most relevant fact to provide a response.

The researchers conducted experiments to investigate LLMs and found that, despite their complexity, these models decode relational information using simple linear functions. Each decoding function is specific to the type of fact being retrieved. For example, one function is used when outputting the instrument a person plays, while a different function is used to output the state where a person was born.

To estimate these simple functions, the researchers developed a method and calculated functions for 47 different relations, such as ""capital city of a country"" and ""lead singer of a band."" Although there are countless possible relations, the researchers focused on this subset as it represents the types of facts that can be expressed in this manner.

To test each function, the researchers modified the subject to determine if it could recover the correct object information. Their findings provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying LLMs and how they process and retrieve knowledge.

In summary, the study reveals that despite their complexity, large language models often employ simple linear functions to recover and decode stored facts. This discovery opens up possibilities for identifying and rectifying falsehoods within the model, ultimately improving the accuracy of these models in providing reliable information.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/large-language-models-2.jpg,2024-03-25 09:34:06,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/03/25/adopting-ai-legislation-and-best-practices/,Adopting AI Legislation And Best Practices,"The global AI market is growing rapidly, with projected revenues of $1.81 trillion by 2030. However, despite this growth, legislation in the AI field is lagging behind, leading to questions and controversy about its role. In order to address this issue, it is important to understand the need for AI legislation and what steps companies can take in the meantime.

One of the main reasons why legislation is needed is to govern the use of AI technology and prevent misuse. The recent Taylor Swift deepfake incident serves as a reminder of the risks associated with AI. As technology progresses, it becomes easier to create fake photos, videos, and other forms of content, often with disastrous consequences. Legislation can help establish guidelines and regulations to ensure the responsible use of AI and protect individuals and businesses from potential harm.

Another area that requires attention is copyright infringement. AI relies on vast amounts of data for training purposes, and there is ongoing debate about what constitutes fair use of copyrighted material. Should AI companies be required to compensate original authors for using their work? Where is the line between fair use and copyright infringement? These are complex questions that need to be addressed through legislation to provide clarity and prevent legal disputes.

While some of these issues are being addressed in court cases, legislation is ultimately needed to provide a clear path forward. In the meantime, companies can take steps to establish best practices for AI use. One important step is to upskill employees and provide them with the necessary training and education about AI technology. This includes understanding its capabilities, limitations, and associated risks. By doing so, companies can ensure that employees use AI responsibly and protect sensitive data.

Using internal AI models instead of widely available options can also help protect data and provide customization options. Internal models allow companies to segregate their data and tailor the AI model to their specific needs. This not only enhances data security but also provides a greater level of control and customization.

Addressing bias is another crucial aspect of responsible AI use. AI has the potential to perpetuate racial and gender biases if the training data is not diverse. Companies should ensure that their training data includes a wide range of diversity to prevent biases from influencing their models. Regular tests and evaluations should also be conducted to identify and address any biases that may exist.

Furthermore, companies must continually evaluate their AI use as technology and legislation evolve. This includes making adjustments to training data, access policies, and regulatory compliance. AI is not a one-time implementation but an ongoing process that requires constant monitoring and adaptation.

While legislation is still catching up with the rapid pace of AI development, companies have a responsibility to self-regulate and follow best practices. By doing so, they can protect their own interests and those of their customers. In the absence of comprehensive legislation, it is crucial for companies to take proactive measures to ensure the responsible and ethical use of AI.

The field of AI remains a ""Wild West"" in terms of regulations, but companies can take the lead in establishing best practices and setting a positive example. Ultimately, legislation will be necessary to provide a comprehensive framework for AI use and address the complex challenges and controversies that arise. Until then, companies should prioritize education, internal models, bias mitigation, and continuous evaluation to ensure the responsible and beneficial use of AI technology.

The healthcare industry is constantly evolving, and one of the most transformative technologies on the horizon is generative AI. With the potential to enhance operational efficiency, accelerate decision-making, and improve accessibility and affordability of healthcare services, it's no wonder that more and more healthcare organizations are exploring its implementation.

According to a recent Deloitte study, 75% of top-tier healthcare organizations are actively exploring or planning to expand the use of generative AI in their operations. This technology has the power to revolutionize the industry, and consumer sentiment reflects this optimism. In fact, 53% of respondents believe that generative AI can enhance healthcare accessibility, while 46% anticipate its role in making healthcare more affordable. An impressive 71% of those surveyed even believe that generative AI could be a transformative force in the healthcare industry.

The benefits of generative AI in healthcare are vast. The industry faces numerous challenges, such as bureaucratic inefficiencies, worker burnout, labor shortages, and long wait times for patients. Generative AI has the potential to address these issues and improve the quality and effectiveness of healthcare services.

Despite being in its nascent stages, generative AI has already demonstrated remarkable power and versatility. It can efficiently summarize complex medical texts, generate informative and coherent text, provide diagnostic and treatment insights, and even translate foreign languages. Additionally, its multimodal features allow for the transformation of textual descriptions into accurate visual representations and the interpretation and analysis of medical images.

One of the most striking benefits of generative AI is its user-friendly interface. Unlike traditional technologies that require specialized programming knowledge, generative AI operates on the principles of natural language processing. This means that healthcare professionals can interact with it using everyday language, making it accessible to a broader range of users without extensive technical training.

Implementing generative AI in healthcare requires a well-thought-out strategy. It's crucial not to overemphasize the technology itself but instead focus on its appropriate applications. Identifying specific problems that generative AI can solve is key to successful implementation. Starting with lower-risk areas, such as automating administrative tasks like scheduling appointments and managing patient records, can streamline processes, enhance efficiency, and reduce human error.

However, it's important to strike a balance between automation and human intervention. A well-designed system should include a mechanism for a natural handoff to live agents, ensuring quality and empathy in healthcare services. By automating routine and tedious processes, generative AI frees up physicians and nurses to focus more on patient needs.

Data management is another critical aspect of implementing generative AI effectively. Access to sizable and relevant datasets is essential for achieving optimal results. However, obtaining and managing this data can be challenging, as it is often siloed or complex to navigate. Establishing the right infrastructure to manage and utilize data effectively is crucial for the success of generative AI in healthcare.

Finally, customization plays a significant role in tailoring generative AI models to specific needs. Whether using large language models (LLMs) or small language models (SLMs), customization is vital for fine-tuning the technology to deliver accurate and relevant results.

In conclusion, generative AI has the potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry. With its ability to enhance operational efficiency, improve accessibility and affordability, and streamline processes, it is a transformative force that healthcare providers cannot ignore. By approaching its implementation with a well-thought-out strategy and focusing on appropriate applications, healthcare organizations can harness the power of generative AI to deliver better and more effective healthcare services.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6405efa13b66613f66c92092/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 09:15:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/apple-sued-microsofts-ai-ambitions-and-nvidia-surprises/,"Apple sued, Microsoft's AI ambitions and Nvidia's surprises","In this edition of Week in Review, we have some exciting news to share about the latest Apple antitrust lawsuit and Microsoft's AI ambitions. Let's dive right in and get all the details!

The US has joined international regulators in accusing Apple of using monopolistic tactics to lock in iPhone users. Apple, on the other hand, claims that the Department of Justice's actions could ruin what its users enjoy about its phones and ecosystem. While the lawsuit draws a connection between Apple and Microsoft in the 1990s, there are key differences between the two companies and their efforts to retain customers. However, experts predict that it could take three to five years for the lawsuit to reach a resolution, so we'll have to wait and see.

But that's not all! We have more updates for you. Reddit's IPO has gotten off to a strong start, with the stock jumping 48% on its first day of trading. Astera Labs, a company that makes connectivity hardware for cloud computing data centers, has also seen success, with its stock closing at $62.03 on day one. And let's not forget about The Browser Company, the startup behind the Arc browser, which recently raised $50 million at a $550 million valuation. They have an ambitious vision to supplant PCs with browsers, but their path to monetization remains unclear.

In the world of AI, Microsoft has absorbed the co-founders of Inflection AI, a high-profile AI startup. Mustafa Suleyman has become the lead of the consumer-facing unit Microsoft AI, while Karén Simonyan is now the EVP and CEO of the same group. This acquisition comes after Inflection raised $1.3 billion, with Microsoft being the biggest investor. Nvidia, on the other hand, made some surprising announcements at its GTC developer conference. CEO Jensen Huang predicted that artificial general intelligence is just five years away, and they also unveiled a new AI platform for humanoid robots called GR00T. Exciting times in the AI world!

There have also been some interesting developments in the tech and hacking world. Google and Apple are reportedly in talks that could lead to Google's AI model being deployed to power several upcoming iOS updates. It's unclear whether this will be a temporary solution or a long-lasting partnership. In other news, the Biden administration is forming an international coalition to fight against commercial spyware, and investors are joining the cause. However, it has been revealed that one of these investors was previously involved in the very business they are now fighting against. And for all the gamers out there, a recent hack brought an Apex Legends tournament to a halt, causing quite a stir in the gaming community.

Lastly, we have some bonus content for you. Did you know that AI is bad at spelling? Despite its massive potential, AI still struggles with simple words like ""burrito."" And speaking of struggles, Fisker, the EV company, has hit a roadblock. They are facing financial difficulties, and if they can't raise more capital, they may have to cease operations altogether. Despite these challenges, it's important to continue testing and reviewing AI systems like ChatGPT and Gemini, even if they can't be truly reviewed.

That's all for this edition of Week in Review. Stay tuned for more exciting updates in the world of tech and AI.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/apple-antitrust-doj-splash.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-23 20:15:37,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/dma-first-formal-probes/,"Apple, Google and Meta face first formal investigations under EU's DMA","The European Union has recently announced a series of investigations on Big Tech companies, collectively known as gatekeepers, under the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Alphabet/Google, Apple, and Meta are the first to face formal non-compliance investigations under the EU's revamped competition rules.

Alphabet/Google is being scrutinized for its rules on steering in Google Play and its approach to self-preferencing in search results. Apple's rules on steering in the App Store and the design of choice screens for alternative web browsers are also under investigation. Additionally, Meta's ""pay or consent"" model will be examined by the EU.

A total of five investigations were announced on Monday, less than three weeks after the compliance deadline for the companies. These gatekeepers, designated under the pan-EU market power and contestability regulation, are facing formal investigations to determine if they are breaching the rulebook, as suspected by the Commission. Violations of the DMA can result in fines of up to 10% of global annual turnover, or even 20% for repeat offenses.

Under the recommended timeframes in the DMA, the EU will have up to 12 months to conclude the investigations, with a preliminary report possible within six months. However, the duration of the probes may vary from these guidelines.

This enforcement action by the EU aligns with the increasing antitrust scrutiny faced by these three US firms on their home turf as well.

Despite the companies' compliance plans, there has been criticism that their proposals do not align with the new EU law. Google, for instance, has been accused of trying to circumvent the regulation's ban on self-preferencing by introducing new rich features in search results that unfairly compete with rivals. Apple's use of notifications to warn users of risks outside its closed ecosystem has been criticized by developers as ""scare screens."" Meta's ""pay or be tracked"" tactic has also faced condemnation from privacy and consumer rights groups.

The Commission has initiated proceedings to assess whether Alphabet and Apple's measures regarding their obligations pertaining to app stores violate the DMA. The Commission is concerned that their steering measures may not be fully compliant, as they impose various restrictions and limitations on app developers' ability to freely communicate and promote offers.

Regarding Google's self-preferencing, the EU investigation will focus on the impact of Google's vertical search services on similar rival services such as Google Shopping, Google Flights, and Google Hotels. The Commission is concerned that Alphabet's measures may not ensure fair and non-discriminatory treatment of third-party services featured on Google's search results page, as required by the DMA.

On Apple's part, the EU will examine whether it complies with user choice obligations on iOS, including the ability to uninstall apps, change default settings, and select alternative default services such as browsers and search engines. The Commission is concerned that Apple's measures, including the design of the web browser choice screen, may prevent users from truly exercising their choice of services within the Apple ecosystem.

As for Meta, the EU will investigate whether its ""pay or consent"" model for EU users complies with the DMA. The Commission is concerned that the binary choice imposed by Meta's model may not provide a genuine alternative if users do not consent, thereby failing to prevent the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers.

During a press conference, Thierry Breton, the EU's internal market commissioner, emphasized the DMA's requirement for gatekeepers to offer a free, non-personalized alternative.

In conclusion, the European Union has launched investigations into Alphabet/Google, Apple, and Meta under the Digital Markets Act. These investigations aim to determine if these gatekeepers are violating the EU's competition rules. The EU will carefully examine various aspects, including rules on steering, self-preferencing, and user choice obligations. The investigations may result in significant fines if violations are confirmed.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1031626648.jpg?resize=1200,799",2024-03-25 12:10:10,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/gostudent-tutoring-profitability/,"GoStudent, the online learning platform, says it's now profitable","GoStudent, an online tutoring marketplace based in Vienna, Austria, has become one of the most successful startups in the country, with a valuation of $3.2 billion. The company has gained recognition for its large user base of 11 million families and 23,000 tutors. In addition to its impressive growth, GoStudent has achieved profitability, a significant milestone for any company. CEO Felix Ohswald stated that the company is not just EBITDA profitable, but also has positive operating cash flow. This achievement sets GoStudent apart from many other startups in the tech scene.

While GoStudent's path to profitability has had its challenges, particularly in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company has managed to navigate through them. The market for online learning experienced a crash, leading to a decrease in customer demand and significant cash burn. GoStudent lost €89 million in 2021 and €220 million in 2022. To address this situation, the company underwent multiple rounds of layoffs and implemented major cost-cutting measures.

GoStudent's rapid growth was accompanied by significant cash burn, reaching €150 million in 2022 alone. However, as the market conditions changed, the company realized that it needed to find a more sustainable path forward. In 2023, GoStudent reduced its burn rate by 70%, but further adjustments were still necessary. The company implemented cost-saving measures, such as cutting back on extravagant events and acquisitions. It also decided to focus on existing markets where online tutoring was already established, rather than expanding to new regions.

The COVID-19 pandemic played a significant role in GoStudent's success, as the digital transformation of education led to increased demand for online tutoring. The company went from having to convince parents about the benefits of online tutoring to becoming the go-to solution for students in need of educational assistance. However, despite the increasing demand, GoStudent needed to address its cash burn issue to ensure long-term sustainability.

To achieve profitability, GoStudent made strategic decisions, including scaling back its international expansion plans. Instead of aiming to be present in 20 countries, the company shifted its focus to Europe and adopted a more organic growth strategy. It also made changes to its leadership team, with a greater emphasis on bottom-line growth rather than top-line growth. The company's acquisition of StudienKreis, a physical learning center network, demonstrates its commitment to evolving its offerings and embracing hybrid learning.

GoStudent's ultimate goal is to build the number one global school and unlock the potential of every student through personalized tutoring. The company believes in the power of technology to connect students with the right tutors regardless of location. Most of GoStudent's tutors are university students, which enables them to establish a strong connection with students while providing quality education.

As GoStudent continues to grow, it faces the challenge of scaling while maintaining a personalized approach. Balancing cost efficiency with the need for individualized tutoring will be crucial for the company's success. By leveraging technology and embracing hybrid learning, GoStudent aims to revolutionize education and ensure that every student has access to personalized tutoring.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Founders-of-GoStudent-Gregor-Muller-I-Felix-Ohswald-2.jpg?w=1024,2024-03-25 11:00:36,Innovation,Innovation
