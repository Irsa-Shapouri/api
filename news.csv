https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-vulnerability-virtual-reality.html,Vulnerability in virtual reality systems identified,"Virtual reality systems have opened up a whole new world of possibilities for users, allowing them to immerse themselves in a virtual environment. However, a team of computer scientists at the University of Chicago has recently identified a potential vulnerability in these systems that could be exploited by hackers. They have described this vulnerability as an ""inception layer"" that could be inserted between a user's VR Home Screen and their VR User/Server.

The team has published a paper detailing their work and findings on the arXiv preprint server. Their research explores the idea of hackers adding an app to a user's VR headset that tricks them into revealing sensitive information. This app would create an additional layer between the user and the virtual world they see when using their VR device - hence the name ""inception layer,"" inspired by the movie Inception.

With this layer in place, hackers could record sensitive information, such as passcodes entered into a virtual ATM. They could also intercept and manipulate data, such as altering the amount of money designated for a purchase and redirecting the difference to their own bank account. Furthermore, hackers could introduce virtual imagery, such as representations of the user's friends or family, to gain their trust or access their secrets. In essence, this app could monitor and manipulate gestures, voice commands, browsing activity, and social or business interactions.

To test the feasibility of this concept, the researchers enlisted the help of 28 volunteers who played a game using a demonstration VR headset. They downloaded a simulated hacking app onto the devices without the volunteers' knowledge and then asked them if they noticed anything unusual. Only 10 of the participants noticed a slight flickering during the download and activation process, and merely one of them questioned whether something malicious was happening.

Upon discovering this vulnerability, the research team promptly informed Meta, the company behind the Meta Quest VR system used in the experiment. Meta responded by stating that they would investigate the issue and address it if it is confirmed. The researchers also point out that similar vulnerabilities are likely to exist in other VR systems and various types of apps that attempt to insert themselves between users and their VR devices.

This research serves as a wake-up call for the VR industry and highlights the importance of addressing potential security flaws. As virtual reality becomes increasingly integrated into our daily lives, it is crucial to ensure that users can trust the technology they are using. By staying vigilant and proactive, we can continue to enjoy the benefits of virtual reality without compromising our privacy and security.

In conclusion, the University of Chicago research team has shed light on a potential vulnerability in virtual reality systems. They have coined the term ""inception layer"" to describe this vulnerability, which could be exploited by hackers to intercept and manipulate user data. The researchers have alerted Meta, the company behind the Meta Quest VR system, about their findings, and the company has expressed its commitment to investigating and addressing the issue. This research emphasizes the need for continued vigilance and proactive measures to ensure the security and privacy of VR users.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/vulnerability-in-virtu.jpg,2024-03-25 10:20:02,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericsiegel/2024/03/25/ai-success-depends-on-how-you-choose-this-one-number/,AI Success Depends On How You Choose This One Number,"AI: The Power of Setting the Decision Threshold

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize operational decisions in businesses. Whether it's determining who to contact, approve, investigate, incarcerate, set up on a date, or medicate, AI can drive these decisions efficiently and effectively. However, there is a critical step that is often overlooked: choosing the decision threshold.

The decision threshold is a single number that differentiates between ""yes"" and ""no"" decisions. For example, a business might choose to market only to customers who are more than 30% likely to buy, or approve only credit applicants who are more than 95% likely to repay. This strategic choice is not a technical one, but rather a business decision that guides the AI's actions.

When it comes to AI, machine learning (ML) is the applicable technology for improving existing, large-scale operations. ML learns from data to predict outcomes, such as whether someone will click, buy, lie, or die. These predictions drive operational decisions and can have a significant impact on business efficiencies.

While ML cannot predict perfectly, it can provide likelihood scores or probabilities. Each predictive model generated by ML can be seen as a ""likelihood calculator"" that assigns a score to each individual case, indicating the chances of the predicted outcome. By setting a decision threshold, businesses can turn these likelihood scores into actions.

Choosing the decision threshold is crucial because it determines how the predictive model will drive decisions and ultimately affects the value of the project. For example, in payment card fraud detection, a threshold must be set to determine which transactions should be authorized or held. A medium-sized bank might choose to block the top 3% most risky transactions, successfully preventing fraud but inconveniencing legitimate customers. Alternatively, a more lenient threshold could reduce inconveniences but allow more fraud cases to slip through.

Every predictive AI project offers a range of trade-offs, and businesses must carefully consider these options when setting the decision threshold. Strategic thinking is required to strike the right balance between maximizing value and minimizing risks or inconveniences. This decision is crucial for operationalizing the predictions and capturing the full potential of the AI system.

By tuning the decision threshold, businesses can use each predictive model developed by data scientists in various ways. It allows them to triage transactions, determine which customers are worth marketing to, or decide how many credit applications should be approved. The decision threshold gives businesses the flexibility to adapt the AI system to their specific needs and requirements.

In conclusion, AI has the power to drive operational decisions, but the decision threshold is the key to unlocking its full potential. By strategically setting this threshold, businesses can optimize their decision-making processes, improve efficiencies, and achieve desired outcomes. It is a critical step that should not be overlooked in any predictive AI project.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600f86863ceebda28e9989e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 09:40:04,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2024/03/25/apple-secretly-engineering-iphone-for-game-changing-update-to-apple-pay-report-claims/,"Apple Secretly Engineering iPhone For Game-Changing Update, Report Claims","The Department of Justice's recent lawsuit against Apple has brought attention to the NFC chip in the iPhone. This chip is responsible for powering Apple Pay, the company's mobile payment system. Currently, Apple restricts access to the NFC chip for security and privacy reasons. However, it seems that this may change in the near future as Apple secretly prepares for it.

According to Mark Gurman of Bloomberg, the EU has already made changes to allow third-party access to the NFC chip, and the U.S. may soon follow suit. The NFC chip enables users to make quick and easy payments by simply tapping their phones on a card reader. Apple's strict control over this chip is understandable, as it ensures the security and trustworthiness of Apple Pay. By keeping it locked, Apple also protects the royalties it charges on each transaction.

In fact, this issue is not new. Gurman previously reported that Apple's policy prevents companies like PayPal, Square, and various financial institutions from launching tap-to-pay iPhone apps with their own features and interfaces. If they want access to the iPhone user base, they must pay a fee for every Apple Pay credit card transaction. Estimates suggest that Apple Pay generates over $1 billion per year in fees.

While Apple has valid reasons for keeping the NFC chip locked, the EU's introduction of the Digital Markets Act earlier this year forced Apple to offer access to the chip. Although Apple was initially hesitant due to security concerns, it eventually agreed. Now, behind the scenes, Apple is preparing for potential changes in other regions as well.

Apple has already opened up NFC access in Europe, and according to Gurman, engineering work is underway to do the same in the U.S. Apple hopes that it never has to implement this change, but it is taking the necessary steps just in case. The timeline for these changes is uncertain, but if things go smoothly in the EU, the U.S. may see similar adjustments in the coming months or years.

Overall, the potential opening up of Apple's NFC chip could have significant implications for the mobile payment industry. It may lead to increased competition and innovation, as well as potential changes in the way financial institutions operate. While Apple has valid reasons for its current restrictions, the evolving regulatory landscape suggests that change may be inevitable.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6601869f70d828f8cfe50372/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3662,2060,x0,y591,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 10:15:49,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.zdnet.com/article/saving-hours-of-work-with-ai-how-chatgpt-became-my-virtual-assistant-for-a-data-project/,Saving hours of work with AI: How ChatGPT became my virtual assistant for a data project,"Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been the talk of the town lately. As someone who has written about it extensively, I must admit that tools like ChatGPT are indeed remarkable. However, it's important to remember that they are just tools, meant to assist us in our projects, much like any other productivity software.

Today, I want to share a project where ChatGPT proved to be incredibly useful, saving me hours of tedious work. While your specific project may not be the same, I hope my thought process and approach can inspire you to utilize ChatGPT as a valuable tool in your own projects.

The project I worked on involved creating what I like to call a ""stunt article."" These articles are fun endeavors that capture readers' attention. In this particular case, I wanted to write about how much computer gear I could buy from Temu for under $100. And guess what? I managed to stay within budget, spending a total of $99.77.

Putting together this article required me to browse the Temu website and select various items to highlight. For example, I stumbled upon an iPad keyboard and mouse combo that cost a mere $6. To ensure I stayed within my $100 budget, I needed to compile all the Temu links, find the prices for each item, and rearrange things until I reached my desired total.

The challenge I faced was converting the Temu links into a usable format. This is where ChatGPT came to the rescue.

Phase 1: Gathering the links
To start, I collected all the links from Temu. Each product's link was copied from the website and pasted into a Notion page. Notion conveniently creates bookmark blocks that not only include the links but also provide the product names. Here's a snapshot of the page I created:

[Insert screenshot]

Although the page may look messy, it served its purpose.

Phase 2: Identifying the data
Let's take a closer look at one of the data blocks. I've switched my editor to light mode to make it easier for you to see the data elements:

[Insert screenshot]

Within each block, three key elements stood out. The product names were highlighted in gold and surrounded by braces. The base URL of the product was displayed in green, enclosed in parentheses. I only needed the main URL, so I discarded the tracking data after the question mark. Lastly, the purple sections indicate the delimiters we'll use for ChatGPT.

Phase 3: Teaching ChatGPT to recognize the data
First, I fed ChatGPT the prompt:
""Accept the following data and await further instructions.""

Then, I copied all the information from the text editor and pasted it into ChatGPT. At this point, ChatGPT understood that more details were to follow.

The next step was crucial. I wanted ChatGPT to extract the titles and links while disregarding the rest. Here's the prompt I used:

""The data above consists of a series of blocks. Each block begins with a section enclosed in [] brackets, which represents the title. After the brackets, there is an open parenthesis followed by a web URL. Extract the URL for each block, omitting the question mark and any subsequent data. Most URLs will end in .html. Display the title followed by the URL, with two newlines separating each entry.""

This process served two purposes. It allowed me to name the data for future reference and ensured that ChatGPT understood the task at hand.

ChatGPT successfully completed the assignment, although it stopped two-thirds of the way through due to limited buffer capacity. I prompted the bot to continue, and it delivered the remaining data promptly. If I had done this manually, it would have involved tedious copying and pasting. With ChatGPT, it took less than a minute.

Phase 4: Cleaning up Temu's complex titles
Temu's product titles were overly complex for my project. Instead of including every detail, I wanted something simpler. For instance, I transformed a title like ""10 Inch LCD Writing Tablet, Electronis Memo With Leather Protective Case, Electronic Drawing Board For Digital Handwriting Pad Doodle Board, Gifts For"" into ""LCD writing tablet with case.""

I assigned this task to ChatGPT as well, reminding it of the previous step where it parsed and identified the data. I find that providing this context helps ChatGPT incorporate the information more reliably.

And there you have it! With the assistance of ChatGPT, I successfully streamlined the process of gathering Temu links and cleaning up their titles, saving a significant amount of time and effort.

While ChatGPT may not be the perfect solution for every project, it certainly proved its worth in this particular endeavor. Consider exploring how ChatGPT can be your trusty workhorse tool, assisting you in various projects and making your life easier.

Remember, generative AI tools like ChatGPT are just that: tools. They enhance our productivity and help us achieve our goals more efficiently. So, embrace the power of AI and unleash its potential in your projects.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/70d8814af33b190ff84b8faa5f9bafe13d3586e2/2024/03/25/7d1cb1ff-3bb7-4972-a6cd-33d04da76bc1/cover.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-large-language-simple-mechanism-knowledge.html,Large language models use a surprisingly simple mechanism to retrieve some stored knowledge,"Large language models (LLMs), such as those used in popular artificial intelligence chatbots like ChatGPT, are incredibly complex and widely used in various fields. However, researchers still do not fully understand how these models work. To gain a better understanding, a group of researchers from MIT and other institutions conducted a study on how these models retrieve and decode stored knowledge.

Surprisingly, the researchers discovered that LLMs often employ a simple linear function to recover and decode stored facts. Linear functions, which involve two variables and no exponents, capture a straightforward relationship between variables. Additionally, the researchers found that the model uses the same decoding function for similar types of facts.

By identifying linear functions for different facts, the researchers were able to probe the model and determine where and what it knows about new subjects. They also developed a technique to estimate these simple functions. Even when a model provides an incorrect answer, it often still stores the correct information. This approach could be used in the future to identify and correct falsehoods within the model, reducing its tendency to provide incorrect or nonsensical answers.

According to Evan Hernandez, an electrical engineering and computer science graduate student at MIT and co-lead author of the study, ""Even though these models are really complicated, nonlinear functions that are trained on lots of data and are very hard to understand, there are sometimes really simple mechanisms working inside them. This is one instance of that.""

The paper detailing these findings was co-authored by Arnab Sharma, a computer science graduate student at Northeastern University; Jacob Andreas, an associate professor in electrical engineering and computer science at MIT; David Bau, an assistant professor of computer science at Northeastern; and other researchers from MIT, Harvard University, and the Israeli Institute of Technology. The research will be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024).

Most large language models, also known as transformer models, are neural networks that contain billions of interconnected nodes. These nodes encode and process data and are organized into layers. The knowledge stored in a transformer can be represented as relations connecting subjects and objects. For example, the relation ""Miles Davis plays the trumpet"" connects the subject (Miles Davis) to the object (trumpet).

As a transformer acquires more knowledge, it stores additional facts about a subject across multiple layers. When a user queries the model about a specific subject, the model must decode the most relevant fact to provide a response.

The researchers conducted experiments to investigate how LLMs decode relational information. Despite their complexity, the models use a simple linear function for decoding. Each function is specific to the type of fact being retrieved. For example, the model uses one decoding function to output the instrument a person plays and a different function to output the state where a person was born.

To estimate these simple functions, the researchers developed a method and computed functions for 47 different relations, such as ""capital city of a country"" and ""lead singer of a band."" While there are countless possible relations, the researchers focused on this specific subset as they are representative of the facts that can be expressed in this manner.

The researchers tested each function by changing the subject to verify if it could recover the correct object information. Their findings highlight the existence of linear decoding mechanisms within LLMs, providing insights into how these models retrieve and store knowledge.

In conclusion, large language models employ linear functions to retrieve and decode stored facts. Despite their complexity, these models exhibit simple mechanisms that researchers can identify and use to understand and correct falsehoods within the model. This study sheds light on the inner workings of LLMs and paves the way for future improvements in their accuracy and reliability.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/large-language-models-2.jpg,2024-03-25 09:34:06,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-strategy-suppress-strain-propagation-ultrahigh.html,A strategy to suppress strain propagation in ultrahigh-Ni cathodes during fast charging,"To meet the increasing demand of the electronics industry and support the widespread use of electric vehicles, researchers are working on developing advanced battery technologies. One promising approach is the use of nickel (Ni)-rich layered oxides as cathode materials in lithium-ion batteries (LiBs). These Ni-rich cathodes have several advantages, including increased battery capacity, improved rate capabilities, and lower fabrication costs. However, they also have limitations, such as capacity degradation and structural instability during fast-charging and long-term cycling.

To address these limitations, researchers at Argonne National Laboratory and other institutes worldwide have introduced a new strategy. They have developed an epitaxial entropy-assisted oxide coating that can improve the structural stability and reliability of ultrahigh-Ni cathodes. This strategy suppresses strain propagation, which is the main cause of cathode failure during fast charging and prolonged cycling.

The researchers designed a specialized oxide coating that aligns with the structure of Ni-rich cathodes. These coatings not only enhance the robustness of the cathode materials' surface but also improve ionic conductivity, thus supporting fast charging. The coating is based on Wadsley-Roth crystallographic shear phases, which have been found to enhance the performance of LiB electrodes. These compounds adhere better to Ni-rich cathodes, strengthening their structural stability during operation and fast-charging.

The team conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of their coating strategy. They coated Ni-rich layered cathodes and tested their performance over time and under different conditions. The results were highly promising, as the approach significantly reduced damage to the cathodes, even during fast-charging and after numerous operation cycles.

The researchers believe that this epitaxial entropy-assisted coating strategy opens up opportunities for surface engineering in the design and development of high-energy and high-power LiBs and beyond. It provides a solution to the challenges associated with Ni-rich cathodes, improving their performance and reliability.

In conclusion, the use of nickel-rich layered oxides as cathode materials shows great potential for enhancing the performance of lithium-ion batteries. The development of an epitaxial entropy-assisted oxide coating offers a solution to the limitations of these cathodes, improving their structural stability and reliability. This coating strategy can pave the way for the design and development of high-energy and high-power LiBs, supporting the growing demand for advanced battery technologies in various industries.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/a-strategy-to-suppress.jpg,2024-03-25 09:40:01,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/fisker-nissan-deal-dead-funding-bankruptcy/,"Fisker loses potential Nissan deal, putting rescue funds at risk","The negotiations between Fisker and a large automaker, rumored to be Nissan, have come to an end, putting the company's near-term rescue funding effort in jeopardy. Fisker announced in a regulatory filing that the automaker terminated the negotiations on March 22, but did not provide a reason for the decision. However, Fisker was required to continue the negotiations as a closing condition for a potential $150 million convertible note. Fisker now plans to request that the unnamed investor waive this closing condition.

Following the news, Fisker's stock plummeted by 28%, leading to a halt in trading. This development is the latest blow to the troubled electric vehicle (EV) startup. Fisker has faced challenges in selling its Ocean SUV, falling short of its internal sales goals. This struggle has led the company to shift away from a direct sales model. Furthermore, some of the vehicles that have been delivered have been plagued by quality issues that Fisker has found difficult to address.

To compound matters, Fisker recently laid off 15% of its workforce, amounting to around 200 employees. The company also reported having only $121 million in cash reserves last week. With production currently paused, Fisker has warned investors that it will not survive the year without a fresh injection of capital. While Fisker has held discussions with other automakers, such as Mazda, Nissan was the only one still engaged in negotiations.

In response to the termination of talks with Nissan, Fisker stated that it is now considering other options for potential partnerships. This includes exploring ""strategic alternatives"" both inside and outside of the court. Fisker may consider capital market transactions, debt refinancing, issuing equity securities, selling assets and businesses, or other strategic measures.

The termination of negotiations with Nissan has dealt a significant blow to Fisker's prospects. However, the company remains determined to find a solution to its financial challenges. Despite the setback, Fisker is actively exploring other avenues for potential partnerships and is committed to securing the necessary funding to continue its operations.

In conclusion, Fisker's negotiations with a major automaker, widely believed to be Nissan, have been terminated, jeopardizing the company's near-term funding efforts. Fisker is now seeking alternative solutions to its financial challenges and remains committed to finding a way forward. The EV startup is determined to overcome its current obstacles and continue its mission of delivering sustainable and innovative electric vehicles to the market.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1236611991.jpg?resize=1200,759",2024-03-25 13:52:11,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/apple-sued-microsofts-ai-ambitions-and-nvidia-surprises/,"Apple sued, Microsoft's AI ambitions and Nvidia's surprises","In this Week in Review, we have some major news regarding the Apple antitrust lawsuit and Microsoft's AI ambitions. Let's dive right in.

The U.S. has joined international regulators in accusing Apple of using monopolistic tactics to lock in iPhone users. Apple, on the other hand, claims that the actions taken by the DOJ could destroy what its users love about its phones and ecosystem.

It's interesting to note that the DOJ is drawing a comparison between Apple and Microsoft in the 1990s, although there are significant differences between the two companies and their efforts to retain customers.

However, experts predict that the lawsuit will not yield immediate results. It is expected to take three to five years to reach a resolution.

Now, let's move on to other updates, including Reddit's IPO, Nvidia's GTC event, and a surprising change in Glassdoor accounts.

Microsoft recently acquired the co-founders of Inflection AI, a high-profile AI startup. Mustafa Suleyman will now lead the consumer-facing unit Microsoft AI, while Karén Simonyan has become the EVP and CEO of the same group. This acquisition follows Inflection's successful raise of $1.3 billion, with Microsoft being the biggest investor.

Nvidia's GTC developer conference had a few surprises in store. CEO Jensen Huang predicted that artificial general intelligence would be a reality in five years, and the company also announced a new AI platform for humanoid robots called GR00T.

Google and Apple are reportedly in talks that could lead to Google's AI model being deployed to power several upcoming iOS updates. It remains to be seen whether this will be a temporary solution until Apple's own AI efforts catch up, a long-term partnership, or a negotiation that never comes to fruition.

Moving on to hacking and privacy, the Biden administration is forming an international coalition to combat commercial spyware. Investors are also joining the fight against spyware, although it has been revealed that one of these investors was previously involved in the very business they are now fighting against.

In the gaming world, a hack disrupted a $5 million Apex Legends tournament. The hacker claimed that it was done ""for fun"" and to draw attention to the exploit used.

Glassdoor users have reported that their real names are being added to their profiles without their consent. The only solution provided to them is to delete their accounts. This serves as a reminder to be cautious about the information shared on the platform.

In terms of funding and IPOs, Reddit's IPO had a strong start, with the stock jumping 48% on its first day. Astera Labs, a company that specializes in connectivity hardware for cloud computing data centers, also had a successful IPO, with its stock closing at a high.

The Browser Company, the startup behind the Arc browser, raised $50 million at a $550 million valuation. The company aims to replace PCs with browsers but is still uncertain about its path to monetization.

In a bonus round, it has been observed that AI struggles with spelling, leading to errors in AI-generated images. Additionally, Fisker has paused production due to financial constraints, and AI systems like ChatGPT and Gemini cannot be truly reviewed, but efforts are being made to put them to the test.

That wraps up this edition of Week in Review. Stay tuned for more updates in the future.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/apple-antitrust-doj-splash.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-23 20:15:37,Innovation,Innovation

When it comes to finding the right headphones for your workouts, the options can be overwhelming. However, the Edifier Comfo Run wireless sports headphones stand out from the crowd. Priced at just $80, these open-ear headphones offer a secure fit, impressive battery life, and excellent audio performance. In this article, we will explore why the Edifier Comfo Run is the perfect workout companion.

A New Take on Open-Ear Headphones:
While bone conduction headsets have gained popularity for their ability to provide music while keeping you aware of your surroundings, they are not for everyone. Many users find the vibrations uncomfortable, and some complain about the lower volume and bass levels. In response to this, a new generation of open-ear headphones has emerged. These headphones feature a traditional form factor with speakers directed towards your ears, providing a more familiar listening experience. What's more, they are available for under $100, making them an affordable alternative.

Comfort and Fit:
The Edifier Comfo Run is designed with your comfort in mind. Covered in soft silicone material and featuring a neckband that exerts minimal pressure on the back of your neck, these headphones provide a comfortable fit for extended periods. Whether you're running, biking, or engaging in other workouts, the Comfo Run stays securely in place. It even remains snug when worn with sunglasses. Additionally, the IP55 dust and splash resistance rating ensures that you can exercise outdoors without worrying about damage.

Impressive Audio Performance:
Equipped with 16.2mm dynamic drivers, the Edifier Comfo Run delivers exceptional sound quality. Unlike bone conduction technology, these headphones rely on traditional speakers to produce rich and immersive audio. The large speaker grills are strategically positioned to maximize volume and clarity. Moreover, the Edifier ConneX smartphone app allows you to customize the audio experience further. With just a few taps, you can toggle on more bass, catering to your personal preferences.

Convenient Features:
Apart from its audio prowess, the Edifier Comfo Run offers several convenient features. The headset's built-in pedometer allows you to track your steps directly from the smartphone app. Although it lacks integration with popular health platforms like Apple Health and Google Fit, it serves as a handy tool for step counting. Additionally, the app enables you to manage firmware updates for the headset, ensuring that you always have the latest features and enhancements.

Long Battery Life:
One of the significant advantages of open-ear headphones over earbuds is the extended battery life. The Edifier Comfo Run impresses in this department, providing up to 17 hours of playtime. This duration far surpasses the battery life of most earbuds available today. Furthermore, recharging the headphones is a breeze, thanks to the USB cable and magnetic connector. Just 15 minutes of charging can offer up to five hours of playback, keeping interruptions to a minimum.

Seamless Connectivity and Call Quality:
While these headphones prioritize workout performance, they do not compromise on call quality. The Edifier Comfo Run features two microphones and beamforming algorithms that ensure crystal-clear audio during phone calls. You can also activate your phone or watch's voice assistant using the built-in microphones, allowing for easy control of your connected device while on the move.

User-Friendly Controls:
The Edifier Comfo Run is equipped with three buttons positioned behind your ear, on the top right side. These buttons provide control over volume, power, phone calls, and your voice assistant. The center button acts as the primary controller, offering a range of functions with different press combinations and durations. While it may take some practice to master all the functions, the user manual provides detailed instructions for easy reference.

Conclusion:
For years, bone conduction headphones have dominated the workout audio market. However, the Edifier Comfo Run presents a compelling alternative. Priced affordably at $80, these open-ear headphones offer a secure fit, impressive battery life, and excellent audio performance. Whether you're tired of losing earbuds during exercise or prefer to be more aware of your surroundings, the Edifier Comfo Run has you covered.

This shift is particularly relevant to Africa, a continent with immense potential for a resilient and nourishing food future.

According to Dr. Cary Fowler, the U.S. Special Envoy for Global Food Security, the traditional approach to addressing food security issues in Africa has been centered around ensuring an adequate food supply. However, there is now a growing realization that the challenge is not just about filling people's bellies but also about providing good nutrition. In order to achieve this, the focus needs to shift towards developing an agricultural system that prioritizes nutrition.

Recognizing the need for this shift, the Vision for Adapted Crops and Soils (VACS) campaign, led by the United States Department of State, the African Union, and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN, has emerged. This campaign aims to uncover the hidden treasures of Africa's agricultural landscape by identifying and promoting climate-resilient crops that meet various criteria, including cultural relevance, climate resilience, and nutrition. Through two comprehensive reports, VACS has the potential to revolutionize food systems from their very core.

Dr. Fowler describes VACS as a ""game-changer."" Unlike traditional food security campaigns, VACS takes a non-prescriptive approach and focuses on indigenous crops that are deeply rooted in Africa's rich cultural tapestry. The campaign intentionally avoids the calorie-dense staples like maize, potatoes, and rice, and instead highlights a shortlist of 20 indigenous crops, including fonio, pearl millet, pigeon peas, taro, yams, and lablab.

The selection of these crops was based on a comprehensive methodology that involved experts from various disciplines, including plant breeders, nutritionists, and climate scientists. Each crop was evaluated based on criteria related to climate resilience, nutritional value, cultural significance, geographic applicability, business case, and environmental benefits.

In the face of numerous challenges, ranging from climate variability to infrastructural barriers, VACS offers hope and direction. It is a testament to the power of collective action and shared purpose in shaping a more nourished, resilient, and prosperous future for Africa and beyond. As Dr. Fowler emphasizes, it is an all-hands-on-deck moment, and the time for transformation is now. VACS is leading the charge towards a brighter tomorrow, one seed, one harvest, one meal at a time, starting with the African continent.

Africa, being at the heart of global food insecurity and climate crises, bears the heaviest burden. Relentless floods and prolonged droughts have ravaged farmlands, leaving millions across sub-Saharan Africa without vital nourishment. Women and children are among the most vulnerable, with over 80% of people in Sub-Saharan Africa being iron deficient.

VACS aims to address these challenges by promoting the cultivation and consumption of climate-resilient crops that are rich in essential nutrients. By diversifying agricultural practices and embracing indigenous crops, Africa can build a more sustainable and resilient food system. This approach not only ensures food security but also preserves cultural heritage and strengthens local economies.

The transformative power of VACS lies in its ability to bring together diverse stakeholders, including farmers, researchers, policymakers, and consumers. By fostering collaboration and knowledge-sharing, VACS creates a platform for innovation and collective action. Through this campaign, Africa has the opportunity to reclaim its agricultural heritage and lead the way towards a more sustainable and nourishing future.

In conclusion, the VACS campaign represents a paradigm shift in addressing food security in Africa. By focusing on climate-resilient crops that are culturally relevant and nutritionally rich, VACS has the potential to transform food systems and build resilience in the face of a changing climate. Through collaborative efforts and a non-prescriptive approach, VACS is paving the way for a brighter and more prosperous future for Africa and beyond. It is an all-hands-on-deck moment, and the time for action is now. Let us join forces and embrace the power of indigenous crops to nourish the world.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66019249d6958363c6c73ff4/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3000,1688,x0,y110,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 11:03:56,Innovation,Innovation
