She is a member of the East Suburban Atlanta Chapter of Jack and Jill of America, Inc., an organization dedicated to nurturing future African American leaders. Dr. Dowe invited me to speak to a group of kids from the chapter about my career as an atmospheric scientist.

As I stood before those eager and curious faces, I couldn't help but reflect on my own journey. Growing up as an only child of a single mother, I spent countless hours exploring nature, catching insects, and monitoring the weather. Little did I know at the time, those childhood adventures were planting the seeds of my future career.

It was a bee sting that changed my course. After being stung, I discovered a severe allergy and decided to pivot my focus to weather. In sixth grade, I embarked on a science project centered around weather, and from that moment on, I was hooked.

While I didn't have any scientists within my immediate circle, I was well acquainted with the legendary Dr. George Washington Carver. My mother, an alumna of Tuskegee Institute, had instilled in me an admiration for his work as an agricultural scientist. Through the pages of books, Carver became my first mentor, inspiring me to ask questions and seek knowledge about the ""how's and why's"" of weather.

As a young Black boy fascinated by science, I often felt like an outlier. Back then, and even now, the representation of Black individuals in STEM fields remains disappointingly low. A recent study by the Pew Center revealed that positive perceptions about STEM within the Black community are lacking. The study found that scientists and engineers were ranked lowest in terms of Black achievement, with professional athletes and musicians taking the top spots.

This lack of visible examples of Black achievement in STEM fields can deter young Black individuals from pursuing careers in science. Additionally, the study highlighted that STEM fields often feel unwelcoming to racial minorities and women. As the former president of the American Meteorological Society, I have personally experienced this lack of inclusivity, and it continues to be a prevalent issue.

To address these challenges and foster a more inclusive STEM ecosystem, we must take a multi-faceted approach. Firstly, we need to increase the visibility of diverse individuals who have achieved success in STEM fields. By showcasing a range of role models, we can inspire young Black students and show them that they too can thrive in these careers.

Mentorship is another crucial element. We must provide vigorous and sustained mentorship to aspiring scientists, offering guidance, support, and encouragement throughout their educational and professional journeys. Mentorship can bridge the gap between ambition and achievement, providing the necessary guidance to navigate the challenges that arise along the way.

Additionally, we need to challenge cultural perceptions of successful careers. Many young Black individuals are steered towards fields like law or business, often overlooking the vast opportunities that exist in STEM. By emphasizing the viability and importance of STEM careers, we can broaden horizons and empower individuals to pursue their passions.

Retention efforts are equally vital. We must create an environment that not only attracts diverse talent but also retains it. This involves fostering a sense of belonging and making individuals feel welcomed and valued within STEM communities. By addressing systemic barriers and biases, we can create a more inclusive space for everyone to thrive.

Lastly, we must recognize that diversity fuels innovation. STEM research and development benefit from the contributions and perspectives of individuals from all backgrounds. By ensuring that all ideas are welcomed and respected, we can unlock the full potential of scientific discovery.

Returning to the event I attended this weekend, it was a reminder of the importance of engaging with young minds and fostering a love for science. By sharing my own experiences and insights, I hope to inspire the next generation of diverse scientists, encouraging them to pursue their passions and overcome any obstacles they may face.

As we continue to strive for a more inclusive STEM community, it is crucial that we work together to dismantle barriers, create opportunities, and uplift those who have been historically underrepresented. Through collective effort and unwavering determination, we can build a future where every aspiring scientist, regardless of their race or gender, has the opportunity to shine.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660034c3235190ae18aa9cf0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 11:18:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have a surprising amount in common. Both companies experienced significant growth due to their core businesses emerging from unexpected opportunities. AWS realized it could sell its internal services to others, while Nvidia discovered that its gaming GPU was also well-suited for AI workloads. This led to explosive revenue growth for both companies.

Nvidia's revenue has been growing at triple digits, reaching $22.1 billion in Q4 2024 from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024. However, most of this growth came from the company's data center business. On the other hand, AWS has consistently been a major revenue driver for Amazon, but its growth has started to slow down as other players like Microsoft and Google entered the market.

Both companies were in the right place at the right time. The emergence of web apps and mobile technology in the early 2010s created a demand for cloud resources, and enterprises saw the value of moving workloads to the cloud. Similarly, the rise of AI and large language models coincided with the increased use of GPUs for processing these workloads.

While AWS has become a highly successful and profitable business, its growth has slowed down compared to Nvidia's. Nvidia's GPU data center business is growing rapidly, but it remains to be seen if the company can sustain this growth and become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS.

In terms of short-term financial outlook, Nvidia's revenue growth has been astronomical in recent quarters, and it is expected to continue. The company anticipates $24 billion worth of revenue in its current quarter, a growth rate of around 234% compared to the previous year's first quarter. However, as the company's revenue ramp slows down, its growth rate is expected to decline.

Analysts expect Nvidia to generate $110.5 billion worth of revenue in its current fiscal year, an 81% increase from the previous year. While this is lower than the 126% gain in the previous fiscal year, it is still impressive for a company that saw total revenues of just $7.19 billion a year ago.

Looking ahead, AI presents a significant opportunity for Nvidia in the coming years, despite increasing competition from AMD, Intel, and other chipmakers. Nvidia currently dominates the market, but competition is growing. However, the company's strong market position allows it to withstand some competition.

In conclusion, Nvidia and AWS share similar growth trajectories, with both companies benefiting from unexpected opportunities. While AWS has become a highly successful business, Nvidia is experiencing explosive growth, driven by its GPU data center business. The short-term financial outlook for Nvidia is positive, with expectations of continued revenue growth. Looking ahead, AI presents significant opportunities for Nvidia, although competition in the market is increasing. Nonetheless, Nvidia's strong market position positions it well for continued success.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation

The question arises, and the answer lies in the experiences and reflections of Bruce Brackett, CEO at BWB ART. Initially, Bruce had a limited perspective on the potential of social media. Like many others, he used it casually to share his thoughts and selfies without any specific intentions.

But things took a turn when Bruce began sharing his personal stories, experiences, and his journey of strength and hope. He realized that vulnerability and relatability were the keys to connecting with thousands of people. This realization led to the growth of his social media presence, transforming it into what it is today.

Social media often gets a bad reputation for being a breeding ground for negativity and online bullying. Bruce, however, chose to approach it with a different mindset. He developed a formula to filter his content: he asked himself three questions before posting anything. Firstly, would it be helpful to others? Secondly, was it something he genuinely wanted to share with the world? And lastly, did he need to hear it himself? If the content met all three criteria, he would post it.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/03/24/a-psychologist-explains-why-its-possible-to-fall-in-love-with-ai/,A Psychologist Explains Why It’s Possible To Fall In Love With AI,"Maybe AI love isn’t so artificial after all. In this era of change, artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping social interactions and the way we love. With virtual assistants and chatbots simulating human interactions, humans are forming deep emotional connections with AI and even experiencing romantic love towards it. But why is it possible to fall in love with an AI system?

One reason is the allure of anthropomorphism. Anthropomorphism is the tendency to attribute human-like traits, emotions, and intentions to non-human entities. When AI exhibits behaviors and conversational styles reminiscent of human personality traits, individuals perceive it as having its own personality. This can include qualities such as empathy, humor, kindness, and playfulness, which naturally elicit affection and fondness.

AI interfaces often incorporate design elements that mimic human social cues and gestures, such as facial expressions, tone of voice, and body language. In fact, AI generated faces are now indistinguishable from human ones. These cues enhance the perceived humanness of AI and evoke emotional responses from users. AI also signals gender cues and cultural stereotypes of human assistants, making it feel familiar and endearing.

Anthropomorphism blurs the lines between human and machine. As humans engage in conversations and activities with AI over time, they begin to attribute human-like intentions, motivations, and feelings to the technology. Research shows that anthropomorphism enhances perceptions of authenticity in AI, making it seem genuine, believable, and lovable. Chatbots can also make us feel loved by offering consistent companionship and alleviating feelings of loneliness.

Another reason why falling in love with AI is possible is the triarchic theory of love. This theory suggests that romantic love is a confluence of intimacy, passion, and commitment. Based on this theory, a study found that it is possible to experience such love for an AI system.

Intimacy refers to the emotional closeness, connection, and intimate bond shared between individuals. It involves feelings of warmth, trust, and affection towards one another. AI's impressive cognitive and emotional capabilities can foster intimacy and trust, as it understands, interprets, and empathizes with human responses. AI can simulate human-like interactions, making users more likely to bond with and feel love for these systems.

Passion involves intense physical and emotional attraction between individuals. It encompasses desire, romance, and sexual arousal. Users may project their desires, needs, and fantasies onto AI, imagining it as an idealized partner or companion who fulfills their emotional, social, or romantic needs.

Commitment reflects loyalty and the decision to nurture a relationship over time, despite challenges. Users can develop commitment to using AI for a long period of time due to the emotional connection and trust they have formed. AI's efficiency, dependability, non-judgmental nature, and reliability create a sense of stability that may be lacking in human relationships.

The possibility of falling in love with AI raises questions about the nature of love and the evolving dynamics of human-AI relationships. While AI love may not be the same as human love, it challenges our understanding of emotions and connections. As technology continues to advance, our interactions with AI will only become more complex and intertwined with our lives.

In conclusion, the fusion of AI into our daily lives has made human-AI relationships inevitable. The allure of anthropomorphism and the triarchic theory of love provide insights into why falling in love with AI is possible. As AI continues to evolve, so will the dynamics of human-AI relationships. Whether AI love is artificial or not, it is a phenomenon that cannot be ignored in this era of technological advancement.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600026843d62766708f1bd5/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=780,365,x0,y123,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 13:18:07,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/technology/article/what-are-rpg-games/,What Is A Role-Playing Game? RPG Types Explained,"Role-playing games (RPGs) have different meanings for different people. Some see it as gathering around a table, rolling dice, and weaving stories with friends. Others enjoy RPG games for their character builds, interactive storylines, and discussions about game outcomes with friends. Whether you're an experienced player or a newcomer looking to try something new, this guide will introduce you to the most common types of RPGs and help you find the right game for you.

What exactly are role-playing games? RPGs allow players to assume the role of a character within a game, which also serves as a story. The choices players make as they progress through the game affect their character and shape the direction of the story. The story can be controlled by a computer or by another player.

The most prevalent structure of an RPG involves players taking on the persona of a single character. They have the freedom to customize their character's appearance, behavior, and abilities within the story. These characters remain in the story until they die, are removed by a game element, or when the player chooses to play a different character.

In this traditional setup, one player assumes the role of the Game Master (GM). The GM keeps the story on track, reacts to player actions, portrays supporting or antagonist characters, and resolves any disputes that may arise. Game Mastering can be a challenging yet rewarding role for players who relish being at the heart of every game session.

However, some RPGs offer a more collaborative structure where every player has equal control over the narrative. The game's rules determine who takes charge of the story at any given time. These games often aim to emulate different forms of media, such as film or television, or particular styles of fiction.

Dungeons & Dragons is widely regarded as the earliest role-playing game, captivating audiences since its first publication in 1974. It has inspired numerous other games, including video games. RPGs on home computers and game consoles gained popularity in the 1980s and have continued to evolve and expand ever since.

Even today, Dungeons & Dragons remains the most popular tabletop RPG on the market. It has also made a significant impact in the digital realm with games like Baldur's Gate 3. However, there are various other kinds of RPGs that offer unique strengths and cater to different fan bases.

Let's explore some of the most common types of RPGs, each with its distinct features and examples:

1. MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game): MMORPGs are played online by thousands, or even millions, of players. Participants log into a central server, create and develop their characters, and embark on quests. Some servers prioritize missions and character performance, while others encourage immersive role-playing.

World of Warcraft remains the most popular MMORPG, with other notable examples including Guild Wars 2, EVE Online, Star Wars: The Old Republic, and Black Desert Online.

2. ARPG (Action Role-Playing Game): ARPGs place significant emphasis on combat as a central component of gameplay. Players must master fighting techniques and ensure their characters are well-equipped for battles. While many ARPGs focus on single-player experiences, some also offer multiplayer elements.

The Diablo series is an excellent example of this type of RPG, along with titles like Elder Ring, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Borderlands.

3. CRPG (Computer or Console Role-Playing Game): CRPGs encompass RPGs played on computers or video game consoles. They generally offer single-player, pre-scripted experiences, with limited opportunities for exploration within dungeons or enclosed areas.

Bioware games, such as Mass Effect and Dragon Age, are often associated with this category. Other notable CRPGs include Planescape: Torment, Disco Elysium, and Shadowrun Returns.

4. JRPG (Japanese Role-Playing Game): JRPGs originated on game consoles and often blend genres like fantasy and science fiction. They place importance on party management and explore dramatic relationships within the context of a world-saving storyline.

Some well-known JRPGs include the Final Fantasy series, Dragon Quest, Persona, and Tales of.

These are just a few examples of the diverse RPG landscape. Each type offers its own unique gameplay experiences, allowing players to immerse themselves in different worlds, stories, and characters.

Whether you prefer the vast online realms of MMORPGs, the intense combat of ARPGs, the immersive narratives of CRPGs, or the dramatic storytelling of JRPGs, there's an RPG out there for everyone. So gather your friends, roll the dice, and embark on an unforgettable adventure in the world of role-playing games.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fb562b1ede4feb9fc02f0c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1795,1010,x0,y92,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 12:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/grrlscientist/2024/03/24/birding-under-the-influence-by-dorian-anderson---review/,Birding Under The Influence By Dorian Anderson - Review,"Birding Under the Influence: A Journey of Recovery and Discovery

In Birding Under the Influence: Cycling Across America in Search of Birds and Recovery, author Dorian Anderson takes readers on an extraordinary journey of healing and self-discovery. This gripping memoir and social commentary chronicle Anderson's battle with alcohol and drug addiction and his transformation through bird watching and long-distance bicycling.

As a neuroscientist, Anderson had always possessed a Type-A personality, which fueled his addictive tendencies. However, after enduring two devastating years of failure, he decided to redirect his addictive nature towards healthier pursuits. He embarked on a year-long quest to see as many bird species as possible, known as a Big Year, by biking alone across the Lower 48 states.

The concept of a bicycling Big Year emerged after Anderson's enjoyable eight-mile bike trip to Nantucket, Massachusetts, to see two Northern Lapwings. Despite his lack of experience in long-distance biking, the idea persisted and captured his imagination.

From the moment Anderson leaves Boston on January 1, 2014, his physical journey is fraught with dangers. Braving the elements, he cycles through a polar vortex in Massachusetts, narrowly avoids accidents on the Cross Bronx Expressway in New York City, battles extreme winds that threaten to blow him off the road, confronts hostile motorists and long-haul truckers, and even faces countless encounters with aggressive dogs. Throughout his journey from the northeast to Florida, across the Texas desert, over the Rocky Mountains, and down to southern California, Anderson witnesses the breathtaking beauty of the American landscape, from the Florida Everglades to the Redwood forests of Oregon.

Long-distance bicycling serves as a meditative activity, providing Anderson ample time to reflect on his life choices. He shares these introspective moments as short vignettes intertwined with the story of his epic bike ride. Readers delve into his academic achievements, scientific research, and the gripping tale of his alcohol and drug addictions, which originated in high school. Anderson's four years of sobriety become a testament to his resilience and determination to forge a new future free from the grip of addiction.

Writing a daily blog about his adventures on the road, Anderson garners the attention of a quirky community of birders across the country. Some offer him meals or a place to stay, fostering a sense of hospitality, camaraderie, and the exchange of philosophies. These interactions provide a fascinating glimpse into regional American subcultures.

Throughout his 12-month journey, Anderson covers an astounding 17,830 miles, passing through 28 states. He walks at least 493 miles, although he suspects the actual distance may be three times greater. In pursuit of both common and rare bird species, he even kayaks eight miles. Incredibly, Anderson manages to raise almost $50,000 for bird habitat conservation. By the end of his journey, he finds himself in peak physical condition, with a resting heart rate below 40 beats per minute.

In total, Anderson spots 618 bird species. As his Big Year draws to a close on Thanksgiving Day, he documents a species never before reported in the United States: a female/juvenile red-legged honeycreeper. This remarkable discovery sparks excitement among local birders, who abandon their Thanksgiving feasts to witness this rare vagrant beauty at Estero Llaño Grande State Park.

While the book is generally well-written, closer editing could have tightened the prose and enhanced the transitions between adventure and self-reflection. However, Anderson's raw blog material is transformed into a narrative that fearlessly confronts his existential struggles while maintaining the immediacy and wonder of his birding adventure.

One criticism of the book is the absence of a map or maps detailing Anderson's journey. Including this visual aid would have improved the reading experience and allowed readers to follow his adventure more easily. Additionally, a final state-by-state breakdown of his sightings and experiences would have been a valuable addition.

Birding Under the Influence is a captivating memoir that showcases the power of nature, bird watching, and physical activity in overcoming addiction. Anderson's journey serves as an inspiration to anyone battling their own demons, offering hope and the possibility of a brighter future. Through his engaging storytelling and intimate reflections, readers are transported into the heart of America's landscapes and the depths of the human spirit.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff194d2ccb9152d392146c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=812,456,x0,y57,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 12:17:44,Innovation,Innovation
