https://www.zdnet.com/article/singapore-university-sets-up-ai-research-facility-for-public-good/,Singapore university sets up AI research facility for 'public good',"The National University of Singapore (NUS) has recently established an AI Institute to drive research in artificial intelligence (AI) for the ""public good."" The institute aims to advance AI technologies in areas such as healthcare, urban sustainability, education, finance, and manufacturing for societal benefits. It will also focus on regulating the use of AI to ensure transparency, accountability, and address ethical concerns. The NUS AI Institute plans to collaborate with industry partners, government agencies, and organizations like IBM and Google Cloud to boost Singapore's AI talent pool and develop real-world applications for various sectors.

The NUS AI Institute will operate with an initial investment of SG$28 million ($20.76 million) from external research grants and the university itself. The funds will be allocated to three key areas: foundational AI research, policy and societal implications of AI, and real-world domain-specific applications. The institute's research projects will address challenges in AI hardware and software systems, AI theory and reasoning, and the development of AI models for various fields such as humanities, social sciences, biology, chemistry, and materials.

By partnering with local and international experts in academia and industry, the NUS AI Institute aims to drive the AI ecosystem and align capabilities to maximize the benefits of AI while addressing challenges and risks.

Singapore businesses are increasingly prioritizing AI and emerging technologies in their IT budgets. According to a study conducted by Colt Technology Services, one in three organizations in Singapore plans to invest in AI and emerging technologies this year. The study also revealed that improving security, acquiring AI and machine learning capabilities, and implementing emerging technologies are top priorities for IT investment in Singapore and Hong Kong.

Overall, the establishment of the NUS AI Institute demonstrates Singapore's commitment to advancing AI research and development for the betterment of society. By fostering collaboration between academia, industry, and government, Singapore aims to position itself as a leading hub for AI innovation and implementation.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/ac999c32ef35ef0fd15d56a18d2f8ddeea0b7198/2024/03/25/2c32ada3-6917-4f0a-b2dd-9e0474dae73f/ai-accountgettyimages-1405004482.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/boeing-ceo-to-leave-company-by-year-end-after-a-wave-of-safety-incidents/,Boeing CEO to leave company by year-end after a wave of safety incidents,"Boeing's CEO, Dave Calhoun, will be stepping down from his position by the end of 2024, according to an announcement made by the company. This decision comes after a series of safety incidents and controversies that have rocked the aircraft manufacturer.

One of the incidents that drew significant attention was a cabin panel blowout on one of Boeing's planes. This incident, along with several others, raised serious concerns about the safety of the company's aircraft. As a result, Boeing has faced intense scrutiny and criticism from both the public and regulatory authorities.

Boeing has been actively involved in an innovation acceleration program called Aerospace Xelerated, previously known as the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI). This program aims to support startups in the aerospace industry. It is unclear how Calhoun's departure will impact this program, and TechCrunch has reached out to Aerospace Xelerated for further information.

In a statement, Calhoun expressed his intention to focus on stabilizing and positioning the company for the future in the coming months. This suggests that there may be ongoing challenges and changes within Boeing that need to be addressed.

The safety concerns surrounding Boeing were further exacerbated when a brand-new 737 Max 9 jet belonging to Alaska Airlines had to make an emergency landing in January. This incident led to the grounding of 171 Max 9 jets for several weeks. It marked the most significant safety crisis for Boeing since the crashes of two Max 8 jets in 2018 and 2019, which resulted in the tragic loss of 346 lives.

Alongside Calhoun's departure, Stan Deal, who currently leads Boeing's commercial airplanes business (BCA), will also be leaving the company. Stephanie Pope has been appointed to take over BCA. Pope has been serving as Boeing's chief operating officer since January of this year. Prior to that, she held the position of president and CEO of Boeing Global Services, where she oversaw the company's aerospace services for commercial, government, and aviation industry customers worldwide.

As this story continues to develop, more information is expected to come to light. The future leadership changes at Boeing will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the company's operations and its efforts to regain the trust and confidence of the public and the aviation industry as a whole. It remains to be seen how the new leadership will navigate the challenges ahead and steer Boeing in a new direction.

In conclusion, Boeing's CEO, Dave Calhoun, will be stepping down from his position by the end of 2024. This decision comes amidst a series of safety incidents and controversies that have plagued the company. The appointment of Stephanie Pope to lead Boeing's commercial airplanes business signifies a shift in leadership and a potential new direction for the company. As this story unfolds, it is crucial to monitor how Boeing will address the challenges it faces and work towards regaining its reputation as a leader in the aerospace industry.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1910140688.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-25 12:48:28,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/uk-government-electoral-breach-voter-data-china/,UK blames China for massive breach of voter data,"The U.K. government has recently pointed fingers at China for a cyberattack that occurred in 2021, compromising the personal information of millions of U.K. voters. The attack targeted the Electoral Commission, and U.K. deputy prime minister Oliver Dowden has specifically blamed hackers working for the Chinese government. This marks the first time the United Kingdom has publicly attributed the breach to China since it was first disclosed in 2023.

According to the Electoral Commission, the hackers managed to access the names and addresses of approximately 40 million U.K. citizens, including those who were registered to vote between 2014 and 2022, as well as overseas voters. The breach began in 2021 but went undetected until a year later. The U.K. National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has stated that it is highly likely that the Chinese hackers also gained access to emails and other data from the electoral register during the attack.

The NCSC has expressed concerns that the stolen data could be used for ""large-scale espionage and transnational repression of perceived dissidents and critics in the U.K."" However, when contacted for further details, a spokesperson for the NCSC declined to attribute the data breach to any specific China-backed threat actor.

In addition to the Electoral Commission breach, Dowden revealed that a separate cyberattack attempt by a China-backed hacking group targeted the email accounts of U.K. lawmakers in 2021. Fortunately, parliamentary authorities were able to prevent any compromises before any email accounts were breached. The NCSC has attributed these attempted email hacks to a Chinese hacking group known as APT31, which has a history of targeting the online accounts of foreign government officials. APT31 is known to use malware capable of creating backdoors into systems and stealing sensitive information.

While the U.K. government has not disclosed the names of the lawmakers whose email accounts were targeted, the NCSC has stated that most of them have been vocal in calling out China's malicious activities. However, Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in the U.K., has denied the allegations and stated that China does not support or condone hacker attacks. He did mention that China will respond to cyberattacks using lawful methods.

The NCSC's director of operations, Paul Chichester, condemned the cyberattacks, stating that they are part of a wider pattern of unacceptable behavior exhibited by state-affiliated Chinese actors. He emphasized that targeting the democratic system is unacceptable, and the NCSC will continue to expose cyber actors that pose a threat to the U.K.'s institutions and values.

In a related development, the Biden administration has also accused several Chinese hackers of being involved with APT31's efforts to target U.S.-based companies. Google security researchers had previously linked APT31 to the targeting of email accounts belonging to both the Trump and Biden presidential campaigns.

Furthermore, leaked documents from Chinese government contractor I-Soon have shed light on how the contractor targets and hacks other governments at the request of Chinese authorities. These documents provide further evidence of China's involvement in cyber espionage activities.

In conclusion, the U.K. government has held China responsible for a cyberattack that compromised the personal information of millions of U.K. voters. The breach affected the Electoral Commission, and the U.K. government has attributed the attack to hackers working for the Chinese government. This cyberattack is part of a wider pattern of behavior exhibited by state-affiliated Chinese actors, targeting democratic systems and institutions. The U.K. and the Biden administration have both called out China for its involvement in cyber espionage activities.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/uk-polling-booth-elections-cyberattack.jpg?resize=1200,777",2024-03-25 15:50:23,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.zdnet.com/article/amazon-knows-you-dont-have-the-ai-skills-for-tomorrow-and-has-a-plan-to-help/,"Amazon knows you don't have the AI skills for tomorrow, and has a plan to help","2023 Day of AI - Dearborn STEM Academy (Boston) Amazon

When we think of Amazon, we often picture a delivery truck bringing a package to our door. However, Amazon is much more than just a delivery service. It is one of the most innovative companies in the world, making significant investments in infrastructure, supply chain, IT, and transportation.

What many people may not realize is that Amazon has been incorporating AI and machine learning into its processes long before it became a popular buzzword. Now, the company is taking its AI expertise and bringing it into classrooms and virtual learning experiences.

To learn more about the future of education and AI, we had the opportunity to chat with Victor Reinoso, the global director of education philanthropy at Amazon. Reinoso, who was previously the deputy mayor of Washington D.C. and had oversight of the city's education budget, is passionate about preparing students for the careers of the future.

In integrating AI education into school curriculums, there are several challenges that schools face. One major challenge is the lack of resources and tools for teachers to effectively teach AI content. In fact, a recent survey conducted by Amazon and Access Partnership found that 70% of educators lack the necessary resources to teach AI skills, despite 60% of them believing that AI should be taught from Grade 6 through university.

To address this education gap, Amazon is taking several steps. They are funding professional development for teachers to help them implement sustainable STEM education initiatives. Additionally, they are increasing awareness of and access to tools and curriculum. Amazon's AI Ready commitment aims to provide free AI skills training to two million people by 2025. They have also launched initiatives such as Hour of Code Dance Party: AI Edition, Amazon Web Services (AWS) Generative AI Scholarships, and free AI and generative AI courses for professionals.

Another challenge in the use of AI in education is the responsible use of AI. Teachers recognize the importance of teaching students how to use AI responsibly, and 60% of educators prioritize this in the AI curriculum. As AI continues to evolve, responsible stewards will be essential in guiding its application.

In conclusion, Amazon is not only a leading e-commerce company but also a pioneer in AI and machine learning. Through their education philanthropy efforts, they are working to bridge the AI education gap by providing resources, training, and curriculum to educators and students. By doing so, they are preparing the next generation for the careers of the future and ensuring that AI is used responsibly.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/08bc5883c45c188259ecb098a51ea114dc119601/2024/03/25/38b15b64-4b2d-45b8-8147-39fda8737c67/amazon-future-engineer-career-discovery-day-20231024-bsd-students-1010.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 10:59:00,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/03/25/3-motivations-behind-cosplaying-according-to-a-psychologist/,"3 Motivations Behind ‘Cosplaying,’ According To A Psychologist","Cosplay, short for ""costume play,"" is a vibrant subculture where individuals dress up as characters from various forms of media, such as comic books, anime, manga, video games, movies, and television shows. It goes beyond just a once-a-year event like Halloween; it is a lifestyle and a regular passion for many. Cosplayers immerse themselves in the worlds of their favorite media franchises, meticulously recreating costumes, hairstyles, makeup, and accessories to accurately portray their chosen characters.

The appeal of cosplay lies in its ability to provide creative self-expression, escapism from reality, and a sense of community. Research shows that authentic self-expression is associated with greater life satisfaction, and cosplay serves as an outlet for creative expression. It allows individuals to celebrate their favorite fandoms and express their passion for fictional characters and stories. Through cosplay, people can explore different facets of their identity and experiment with various personas that they may not feel comfortable expressing in their everyday lives.

A study published in the journal Fashion Theory examined the cosplay subculture in Hong Kong and found that cosplaying allows enthusiasts to momentarily change their identity, creating an exciting, extraordinary, and contented self. It is a form of role and identity transformation, empowering individuals to become superheroes, performers, and even recapture a sense of childhood innocence. Cosplaying boosts confidence by allowing individuals to choose their identity and take on new roles.

For many, stepping into the shoes of a beloved character offers a temporary reprieve from the stress and uncertainty of everyday life. Cosplaying provides an escape from reality, allowing cosplayers to transcend their mundane routines and experience a sense of adventure, excitement, wonder, and popularity. It allows them to fulfill dreams, pleasures, romances, and fantasies that may be lacking in their daily lives. Cosplay can make participants feel like stars or celebrities, offering recognition, admiration, and the chance to be photographed and admired.

Apart from the ability to escape reality, one of the strongest motivations behind cosplaying is a sense of belongingness. Cosplay fosters a sense of community among like-minded individuals and fulfills the fundamental human need to belong. Conventions and gatherings serve as communal spaces where cosplayers can come together, share their passion, and forge lasting friendships. It is a supportive environment where individuals can connect with others who understand their love for cosplay and appreciate their dedication to their craft.

In conclusion, cosplay is more than just dressing up as fictional characters. It is a form of artistic expression, a means to escape reality, and a way to find a community of like-minded individuals. It allows people to explore their creativity, experiment with different identities, and experience the joy of embodying their favorite characters. Whether it's through meticulously recreating costumes or immersing themselves in fantastical worlds, cosplayers find a sense of fulfillment, satisfaction, and belonging in this vibrant subculture.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6601ac3a0b7231e5ced958f7/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2613,1224,x0,y80,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 19:30:41,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/match-board-directors-after-talks-activist-investor-elliott-management/,Match appoints two board directors after talks with activist investor Elliott Management,"Tinder-owner Match Group has made significant announcements, including the appointment of two new directors to its board and an agreement with activist investor Elliott Management. Laura Jones, Chief Marketing Officer at Instacart, and Spencer Rascoff, co-founder of Zillow, have joined Match Group's board of directors. These appointments come after a period of ""constructive dialogue"" between Match and Elliott Management, during which the two companies entered into an ""information-sharing"" agreement. Elliott Management has recently acquired a $1 billion stake in Match Group and has expressed interest in helping the company improve its performance amidst a decline in paying users.

Marc Steinberg, a partner at Elliott Management, expressed confidence in Match Group's potential for value creation, calling it the global leader in online dating. Steinberg highlighted the collaboration between Elliott Management, Match's management, and the board, and praised the latest additions to the board, Laura Jones and Spencer Rascoff. He believes their unique skills and perspectives will support Match Group in its next phase of growth. Elliott Management has a track record of acquiring stakes in tech companies and advocating for changes. This move follows similar board shakeups at Crown Castle and Etsy.

Match Group's fourth-quarter results for 2023 showed a 5% year-over-year decrease in total paid users, with 15.2 million users. The company's growth has slowed from the peak it experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a significant decline in its stock price.

Match Group is the parent company of various popular dating apps, including Tinder, Hinge, Match.com, Meetic, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, OurTime, and more. These apps have gained widespread popularity and have played a significant role in the online dating landscape.

The addition of Laura Jones and Spencer Rascoff to Match Group's board of directors is expected to bring fresh perspectives and expertise to the company. With their involvement, Match Group aims to overcome its recent challenges and continue its growth trajectory. The collaboration with Elliott Management signifies an important step for Match Group in addressing its decline in paying users and finding new avenues for success in the online dating industry.

Overall, Match Group's recent developments indicate a proactive approach to addressing challenges and positioning itself for future growth.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/dma-first-formal-probes/,"Apple, Google and Meta face first formal investigations under EU's DMA","The European Union has recently announced a series of investigations into major technology companies, including Alphabet/Google, Apple, and Meta. These investigations are being conducted under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which aims to regulate and address potential anti-competitive practices in the digital market.

The investigations will focus on several key areas. Alphabet/Google's rules on steering in Google Play and its approach to self-preferencing in search results will be examined. Similarly, Apple's rules on steering in the App Store and the design of choice screens for alternative web browsers will be scrutinized. Meta's ""pay or consent"" model, which involves the use of personal data, will also be investigated.

These investigations come less than three weeks after the compliance deadline for the companies, highlighting the EU's commitment to enforcing the DMA. If any violations are found, the companies could face fines of up to 10% of their global annual turnover, or even 20% for repeat offenses.

The EU has up to 12 months to conclude the investigations, although preliminary reports may be produced within six months. However, the duration of the probes may vary from these guidelines.

Antitrust scrutiny on these three US-based companies is not limited to the EU. They are also facing increasing scrutiny on their home turf. The companies have faced criticism for their compliance plans, with concerns that they do not fully adhere to the new EU law.

Google has been accused of trying to circumvent the ban on self-preferencing by introducing rich features in search results that unfairly compete with rivals. Apple's use of notifications to warn users about the risks of using alternative services has been criticized by developers. Meta's ""pay or be tracked"" tactic has been condemned by privacy and consumer rights groups.

The Commission has initiated proceedings to assess whether Alphabet and Apple are in breach of the DMA regarding their app stores. The EU is concerned that the steering measures implemented by the companies impose restrictions and limitations on developers, hindering their ability to freely communicate and promote offers.

Regarding Google's self-preferencing, the investigation will focus on the impact of Google's vertical search services on rival services. The EU is concerned that these measures may not treat third-party services featured on Google's search results page fairly and non-discriminatorily.

For Apple, the EU will examine its compliance with user choice obligations on iOS, including the ability to easily uninstall apps, change default settings, and select alternative default services. The Commission is concerned that Apple's measures, such as the design of the web browser choice screen, may prevent users from exercising their choice of services within the Apple ecosystem.

In the case of Meta, the proceedings will investigate whether its ""pay or consent"" model for EU users complies with the DMA. The EU is concerned that this model may not provide a real alternative for users who do not consent, thus failing to prevent the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers.

During a press conference, the EU's internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, emphasized that the DMA requires gatekeepers to offer a free, non-discriminatory choice to users. The investigations aim to ensure that these companies are adhering to these requirements.

The EU's enforcement action is a significant step toward regulating and addressing potential anti-competitive practices in the digital market. By holding major tech companies accountable, the EU aims to create a fair and level playing field for all participants in the digital economy.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1031626648.jpg?resize=1200,799",2024-03-25 12:10:10,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/london-regtech-gss-raises-47m-to-help-banks-screen-for-global-sanctions/,London regtech GSS raises $47M to help banks screen for global sanctions,"Global Screening Services (GSS), a London-based regulatory compliance platform, has successfully raised $47 million in funding. This comes at a time when economic sanctions are on the rise, with the U.S. imposing trade restrictions and asset blocking measures against countries like Russia, China, and Iran.

GSS was founded by Tom Scampion, who previously served as the head of financial crime for Deloitte's EMEA arm. In 2020, he became a general partner at consulting firm AlixPartner, where GSS was initially incubated before becoming an independent entity in 2021. Last year, GSS secured a similar amount of funding from prominent investors, including Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group. In its latest funding round, GSS has attracted support from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Cynosure Group, and AlixPartner.

Banks often face the challenge of enforcing sanctions due to their pivotal role in global financial transactions. However, determining the parties involved in money transfers can be a complex task. For instance, in 2019, Standard Chartered was fined $1.1 billion by regulators in the U.K. and the U.S. for inadequate money-laundering controls, including violations of sanctions against countries like Iran. Similarly, BNP Paribas was fined a staggering $8.9 billion in 2014 for processing financial transactions for sanctioned countries designated by the U.S.

Given these challenges, investors have increasingly supported regulatory compliance businesses in recent years. Companies like New York-based Droit and London's SteelEye have secured substantial funding to develop solutions in this space.

GSS offers a sanctions-screening platform that helps banks and financial institutions comply with regulations. Through its cloud-based platform, institutions can input transaction data, which is then compared against a comprehensive set of sanctions lists from around the world. GSS also enriches these lists with additional data points such as dates of birth and International Maritime Organization numbers for ships. Moreover, GSS provides enhanced screening lists that include companies partially owned by sanctioned individuals, companies, or governments identified by regulatory bodies like OFAC, the EU, or the U.K.

With the recent funding injection, GSS is now transitioning from the development phase to becoming fully operational. The company is preparing to onboard its first customers and launch its services.

In conclusion, the $47 million funding round for GSS highlights the growing demand for regulatory compliance solutions in the face of increasing economic sanctions. GSS's platform offers financial institutions an effective way to screen transactions and ensure compliance with global regulations. With its latest funding, GSS is well-positioned to expand its operations and provide valuable services to banks and other financial institutions.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1770041999-e1711386339681.jpg?resize=1200,677",2024-03-25 18:36:37,Innovation,Innovation
