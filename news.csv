Gen AI enterprise leaders will gather for a night of insights and conversations. Request an invite to secure your spot at this exciting event.

When it comes to new technologies, the caution of venture capitalists often goes out the window. They are under pressure to deploy the capital they raised, and the fear of missing out on something big outweighs the downside of taking risks. This is especially true when everyone else is doing the same.

The same dynamic can be observed within companies, particularly in the case of AI and its related technologies. It seems that anything remotely associated with AI becomes a hot topic. Large language models (LLMs), machine learning (ML), and even projects that have been previously denied funding suddenly become AI projects.

Billions of dollars will be wasted on AI in the next decade. This may sound contrary, but it is the reality. Every major technological wave comes with excitement, even before we fully understand its potential. Search, social media, and mobile technologies have all had a significant and lasting impact. However, virtual reality (VR) and cryptocurrencies have been more limited in their reach.

Five years ago, it seemed like VR and crypto were going to revolutionize the world. Today, AI is the buzzword on everyone's lips. Companies are racing to show how much they are investing in AI and how it will change everything. This shotgun approach to investment inevitably leads to a few successes and many failures. The same pressure that drives VCs also pushes company leaders to invest in AI projects that are often optimistic at best and misguided adventures at worst.

However, this does not diminish the fact that LLMs are a game-changing technology. Just look at how quickly ChatGPT reached 100 million users compared to other transformative companies. Nearly every enterprise company is leveraging LLMs and AI in some way. The question is, how do you decide where to invest and where you have the potential to succeed?

To make informed decisions and avoid wasted spending, consider these three factors:

1. Understand the total cost over time: Before saying yes to an AI project, evaluate the resources required to sustain it over time. Often, the work of a data science team requires significant engineering, DevOps, QA, product, and SysOps support. Many companies have abandoned projects that were once promising due to a lack of ongoing investment. Saying no to an AI initiative may be difficult now, but frequent yeses can come at the expense of fully funding projects that truly deserve support in the future. Additionally, AI drives increasing marginal costs, so it is vital to ensure that the downstream value justifies the investment.

2. Ask why others can't do it: Consider the potential for commoditization. In the tech industry, there are monopolies and commodities. When considering an AI initiative, ask yourself why your company is uniquely positioned to succeed. Working on something that will eventually become a commodity can be challenging, especially without a scale or cost advantage. It is essential to focus on areas where you have a defensive moat, such as preferential access to data, proprietary insights, or an application with strong network effects.

3. Make strategic bets: Sometimes, the best investments are those that enhance your existing business. As the old BASF commercial says, ""We don't make the things you buy, we make the things you buy better."" If applying AI can improve your products or give you a competitive edge, it is worth considering. It is crucial to make a few strategic bets that you are willing to see through, rather than spreading resources too thin across multiple projects.

In conclusion, while billions of dollars may be wasted on AI in the coming years, LLMs are undeniably a transformative technology. By considering the total cost over time, questioning why your company is uniquely positioned, and making strategic bets, you can avoid wasted spending and maximize the potential of AI in your business.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/krisholt/2024/03/24/nyt-connections-hints-and-answers-for-monday-march-25/,"NYT ‘Connections’ Hints And Answers For Monday, March 25","Welcome to today's game of Connections! Are you ready to put your puzzle-solving skills to the test? In this game, you will be presented with a grid of 16 words and your goal is to group them into four categories based on their connections. It could be anything from horror movie franchises to types of verbs or even rappers.

Remember, there is only one solution for each puzzle, so choose your groups wisely. Be careful with words that may fit into multiple categories. If you're stuck, don't worry! You can shuffle the words around to help you see the connections between them.

Each group is color coded for your convenience. The yellow group is usually the easiest, followed by blue and green. The purple group is the most challenging and often involves wordplay. So keep that in mind as you tackle the puzzle.

To play, select four words that you think belong together and press Submit. But be cautious, if you make a wrong guess, you'll lose a life. If you're close to a correct group, you may receive a hint telling you that you're only one word away from getting it right. However, you'll still need to figure out which word to swap.

Just a word of caution, if you make four mistakes, it's game over! But don't worry, we're here to help. If you need hints or answers, scroll down slowly after the hints for each group.

Let's dive into today's puzzle!

Today's 16 words are:
- PACE
- CLIPPER
- MOVE
- MEDICINE
- FASTER
- PROMPTER
- ROCKET
- SPEED
- GO
- SPUR
- COMMUTE
- HURRY
- RATE
- VISION
- CLIP
- PACER

And here are the hints for today's groups:
Yellow group — something's swiftness
Green group — speed up!
Blue group — pro athletes
Purple group — linked by a term meaning ""over a long distance""

Now, let's reveal the groups without immediately telling you the words that belong to each group.

Today's groups are:
Yellow group — how fast something is going
Green group — ""step on it!""
Blue group — NBA team player
Purple group — tele____

And now, the moment you've been waiting for. Here are the answers for today's Connections puzzle:

Yellow group — how fast something is going (CLIP, PACE, RATE, SPEED)
Green group — ""step on it!"" (FASTER, GO, HURRY, MOVE)
Blue group — NBA team player (CLIPPER, PACER, ROCKET, SPUR)
Purple group — tele____ (COMMUTE, MEDICINE, PROMPTER, VISION)

Well done if you managed to solve the puzzle! Even if you didn't, remember that practice makes perfect. Keep playing and sharpening your skills.

As for me, I got the blues right away, although I suspected they might be a red herring. The greens and yellows were quite interesting as they seemed to represent noun and verb versions of the same concept. I made a silly mistake by including COMMUTE with the greens instead of FASTER, but once I corrected that, victory was within reach with the purples.

That wraps up today's Connections game. If you need hints or solutions for tomorrow's game, be sure to check out my blog. And before I go, here's a quick life tip for you: make it a point to dine at the best restaurant in your area at least once. Save up if you have to and trust me, it'll be worth it. Treat yourself to a memorable dining experience that goes beyond just takeout.

Good luck with the game, and until next time!",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/64dbcee7d64da3663d88000e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 17:30:02,Innovation,Innovation

It's Monday, and that means it's time to tackle the Wordle puzzle once again. But before we dive into today's challenge, let's take a moment to reflect on the weekend.

The weather played a little trick on us, didn't it? Just when we thought spring was here to stay, it decided to surprise us with a snowy blanket. It may be cold outside, but there's no time to dwell on the weather. We have a Wordle to solve!

So, how do we approach today's puzzle? Well, let's start with the hint. The Wordle today is a proper noun. That gives us a little direction, but we still need more clues to crack the code.

Luckily, we have the clue that there is a double letter in the word. Ah, now things are getting interesting. A double letter narrows down the possibilities and gives us a fighting chance.

Now, let's get to the answer. Drumroll, please...

The answer to today's Wordle is... *insert answer here*. Congratulations if you managed to solve it! If not, don't worry. It's all part of the fun and challenge.

Wordle Analysis

After solving the Wordle, it's always interesting to analyze our performance. Did we struggle? Did we breeze through it? Let's find out.

For today's puzzle, things didn't start off on the right foot. Trade left us with a whopping 195 potential solutions. That's a lot to work with! But we didn't let that discourage us.

Next, we tried ""boink,"" hoping it would narrow down the options. Unfortunately, it only reduced the possibilities to 40. We needed something more.

And then came the breakthrough. The word ""allay"" turned out to be a great guess. It confirmed the existence of more than one ""L"" and left us with only one word left to consider. It was a moment of triumph.

After some brainstorming, we settled on ""sally."" Yes, it's a name, but it also has another meaning. It can refer to a battle tactic, a sudden rush or attack from a defensive position. How fitting for a Wordle solution!

Competitive Wordle Score

Ah, the competitive aspect of Wordle. Did we earn any points this time? Unfortunately, it's a wash. No points for guessing in four or tying with the Wordle Bot. It's a big fat zero for us this time.

Today's Wordle Etymology

Now, let's take a moment to appreciate the etymology of the word ""sally."" It's always fascinating to explore the origins of words and how they have evolved over time.

In a non-proper noun context, ""sally"" means to suddenly rush forth or make a sudden attack from a defensive position. It can also refer to setting out on a journey or venture. But where does this word come from?

The Middle French word ""sallie,"" meaning ""to rush out, leap forth,"" is at the root of ""sally."" This Middle French word traces its origins back to the Latin word ""salire,"" which means ""to leap."" The idea of movement or leaping forth is reflected in related English words like ""salient"" (prominently projecting) and ""assail"" (to attack).

So, the etymology of ""sally"" captures the essence of suddenness and unexpectedness, whether it's a physical attack from a fortified position or embarking on a new journey.

Conclusion

That concludes today's Wordle adventure. We hope you enjoyed the challenge and the insights into the word ""sally."" Don't forget to check out our blog for more Wordle and Strands guides, as well as other exciting content on TV shows, streaming guides, movie reviews, and video game coverage.

The ultimate battleground was Icebox, where the teams fought tooth and nail. After 10 rounds, the scores were tied at 5-5, demonstrating the intensity of the match. However, Sentinels gained momentum before the break and secured a 7-5 advantage heading into the final half of the tournament. They continued their excellent performance after the break, extending their lead to 9-5 before Gen.G managed to secure another round. Unfortunately for Gen.G, that would be their last victory, as Sentinels dominated the remaining rounds and emerged victorious with a 13-6 score, securing both the map and the championship.

The Valorant Masters Madrid tournament also introduced a new agent, Clove, who possesses the unique ability to resurrect and create smokes from beyond the grave.

In conclusion, Sentinels emerged as the champions of the Valorant Masters Madrid tournament after a fierce showdown against Gen.G. The tournament showcased the exceptional skills and determination of both teams, as they navigated their way through intense matches to secure their spots in the final. The introduction of the new agent, Clove, added an enticing element to the competition, further enhancing the excitement for Valorant fans worldwide.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600832a1389114562dc7741/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 17:13:21,Innovation,Innovation
