https://www.forbes.com/sites/karlfreund/2024/03/25/cerebras-update-the-wafer-scale-engine-3-is-a-door-opener/,Cerebras Update: The Wafer Scale Engine 3 Is A Door Opener,"Cerebras recently hosted an AI Day event that garnered a lot of attention. Despite the simultaneous occurrence of GTC, the event was packed with attendees. Cerebras Systems, a startup that stands out for its success in training AI, unveiled the third generation of its Wafer-Scale Engines (WSE-3) at the event. This powerful chip surpasses racks of GPUs in terms of performance and comes with a partnership with Qualcomm to offer custom training and collaborate with Edge AI leader in Go-To-Market efforts. The event featured numerous images from Cerebras, which effectively conveyed the company's message. In this article, we will delve into the highlights of the AI Day event, while also discussing the challenges faced by this ambitious startup.

The Cerebras CS-3 and Galaxy Clusters
The CS-3, along with the WSE-3, represents the third generation of wafer-scale engines. This engineering marvel aims to simplify scaling, rather than being compared to a single GPU chip. Cerebras questions the need for cutting up a wafer of chips, packaging each one with HBM, placing them on a board, connecting them to CPUs with a fabric, and then tying them all back together with networking chips and cables. This complex process often requires extensive programming to distribute the workload and create a supercomputer. Cerebras, on the other hand, proposes a more efficient solution.

Andrew Feldman, CEO and co-founder of Cerebras, expressed his pride in introducing the third generation of their wafer-scale AI chip. WSE-3 is purpose-built for the latest AI work, including mixture of experts and 24 trillion parameter models. In terms of transistor count, GPUs are projected to match WSE-3's capabilities in approximately six years. Cerebras calculated that WSE-3 is 57 times larger than Nvidia's H100, with 52 times more cores, 800 times more memory on chip, 7,000 times more memory bandwidth, and over 3,700 times more fabric bandwidth. These impressive statistics serve as the foundation for its outstanding performance.

The WSE Magic
However, the true magic of the WSE lies in its ability to treat a large cluster as a single instance, eliminating the need for extensive distributed computing coding effort. By streaming the weights of massive models instead of storing them on-chip, Cerebras' MemoryX and SwarmX interconnect can integrate up to 2048 CS-2 servers into a theoretical cluster. While creating such a monster would cost around $5 billion, Cerebras offers this as an option for those with the necessary resources.

This approach also addresses a major challenge in building trillion-parameter models. OpenAI's GPT-4 required the contribution of 240 individuals, with 35 engineers solely dedicated to solving the distributed computing problem. Cerebras not only reduces this problem but eliminates it entirely.

The Unified Interface
Cerebras' software stack presents a unified interface to the AI Supercomputer, regardless of its size. The company claims this interface provides real business value, enabling quick model deployment with only 5% of the resources required by other AI platforms. This advantage gives Cerebras a strong competitive edge.

Cerebras' Expansion Plans
Cerebras recently announced its progress in building the third of nine planned supercomputers worldwide. The Galaxy 3, based on CS-3, is currently under construction. By the end of 2024, Cerebras aims to complete the remaining six supercomputers.

More on the WSE-3
The WSE-3 is not just a shrink of its predecessor, but also introduces new SIMD engines for 8 and 16-bit numerics, as well as new non-linear functions (activations). These enhancements result in twice the performance per core compared to the WSE-2.

Unlimited Scalability
From both a hardware and software perspective, the CS-3 is designed for massive scalability. Cerebras has built a highly scalable system that can meet the needs of organizations willing to invest the required capital.

Conclusions and Challenges for Cerebras
Cerebras stands out as a truly different alternative to Nvidia. Unlike other options that may only offer a slight improvement, Cerebras presents a completely distinct approach. It is not just another ASIC that resembles a cheaper GPU, nor is it a traditional GPU. Cerebras faces challenges as it strives to revolutionize the AI industry, but it has already proven its ability to make significant strides.

In conclusion, Cerebras' AI Day event showcased the impressive capabilities of the CS-3 and WSE-3. The company's innovative approach to wafer-scale engines and its unified software interface offer unique advantages in the AI field. While challenges lie ahead, Cerebras has positioned itself as a formidable player in the industry. With its continued dedication to pushing boundaries, Cerebras is set to make a lasting impact on the future of AI.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660199b20a6fbc5033ee1cdf/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 15:16:13,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/25/total-eclipse-of-the-chatbot-why-not-to-ask-chatgpt-about-aprils-rare-event/,Total Eclipse Of The Chatbot: Why Not To Ask ChatGPT About Aprilâ€™s Rare Event,"The world of AI chatbots may have its limitations, and when it comes to total solar eclipses, it seems that even the most popular ones fall short. Take ChatGPT, for example. When asked about the next total solar eclipse, it provided some rather odd and inaccurate responses. But fear not, there are other AI models out there that can provide more reliable information.

So, when is the next total solar eclipse? According to ChatGPT, it happened on December 14, 2020, in South America. However, that information is outdated and irrelevant. The correct answer is April 8, 2024, and it will be visible from parts of North America, including Mexico, the United States, and Canada. Phew, that's a relief!

Curiosity got the best of me, and I decided to test ChatGPT's knowledge further. I asked about the next total solar eclipse after April 8, 2024, and it replied with an odd response, suggesting that it will occur on August 23, 2044. While there will indeed be a total solar eclipse on that date, it is not the next one. The real next one is on August 12, 2026, in Greenland, Iceland, and Spain. In fact, between April 8, 2024, and August 23, 2044, there will be a staggering 13 total solar eclipses. It seems that ChatGPT may have a bias towards events happening in the contiguous United States.

To further test its accuracy, I asked about the next total solar eclipse after August 23, 2044. ChatGPT confidently claimed that it would happen on March 20, 2053. However, that is not true at all. The actual next one after August 23, 2044, will be on August 12, 2045, and it is arguably dubbed the ""Greatest American Eclipse"" of all. While there is an eclipse set for March 20, 2053, it is not a total solar eclipse.

It is clear that ChatGPT is inconsistent, biased towards events in the U.S., and often completely wrong when it comes to solar eclipses. However, there is another AI model called Gemini (formerly known as Bard) developed by Google, which seems to provide more accurate and reliable information. When asked about the next total solar eclipse, Gemini responds with confidence, stating that it will occur on April 8, 2024, visible across parts of North America. It even goes the extra mile to inform me that I will be able to see it where I live. Impressive!

It's disappointing to discover that AI chatbots like ChatGPT are not reliable sources of information for celestial events that have been meticulously calculated for thousands of years into the future. However, we can still rely on other sources for accurate and up-to-date information on total solar eclipses.

If you're an eclipse chaser seeking the very latest on total solar eclipses, including travel and lodging options, I recommend checking reputable sources and staying updated through reliable articles. And with that, I wish you clear skies and wide eyes for your future eclipse adventures.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66016f04433add21d5071fb4/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2004,1128,x10,y411,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 13:00:51,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/techcrunch-mobility-the-wheels-are-starting-to-come-off-the-fisker-ev-bus/,TechCrunch Mobility: The wheels are starting to come off the Fisker EV bus,"Welcome to TechCrunch Mobility, your go-to source for all things transportation. In this week's edition, we'll be covering a range of topics, from the latest regulations affecting automakers to exciting partnerships and investments in the industry. So let's dive in!

First, let's talk about the recent developments on Capitol Hill. The Biden Administration has proposed two new standards through the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that will have significant implications for U.S. automakers and consumers alike. While these regulations have been adjusted to accommodate the concerns of the automotive industry, car dealers, and unions, they still impose stricter standards than before.

The DOE has introduced a ""petroleum equivalency factor"" that assigns a score to electric vehicles (EVs) under the government's corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. The initial proposal could have made it challenging for automakers to meet these standards, resulting in hefty fines. However, the revised version is more lenient. On the other hand, the EPA has released tailpipe standards for 2027 to 2032 model year vehicles, imposing more rigorous requirements on automakers. Nevertheless, they offer flexibility in meeting the rules through various powertrain options, making them technology-agnostic. These standards are also less stringent than the original proposal, which aimed for 67% of all U.S. passenger vehicle sales to be EVs by 2032.

While these changes may not have a significant impact on EV startups like Rivian, Tesla, and Lucid, they do pose challenges for legacy automakers. These companies are investing billions in developing and selling EVs while still relying on profits from internal combustion engine vehicles. In this context, plug-in hybrids might emerge as the winners.

Now, let's move on to some exciting news in the industry. One of the highlights this week is Uber's first investment in an Africa-founded startup. Moove, a mobility fintech company based in Africa, raised $100 million in a Series B funding round led by Uber. Moove provides vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers and is valued at $750 million. This investment aligns with Uber's commitment to achieving a fully zero-emission fleet by 2040, as Moove has made electric vehicles a central part of its business strategy.

In other news, Clevon, a company specializing in autonomous delivery technology, has managed to secure funding and is in the process of finalizing a merger agreement with an American electric vehicle company. This development comes after rumors of the company's struggle to find new investments and potential shutdown. While some cost reductions are necessary, Clevon remains operational and expects the merger to be completed by the first half of June.

Additionally, a Bay Area startup called Amber has raised $3.18 million in a seed round for its aftermarket Tesla extended warranty product. This funding round was co-led by Era and Primer Sazze, with participation from other investors. Another notable development is the electric boat maker Candela raising $25 million in funding, led by Groupe Beneteau, to support its innovative products.

These are just a few of the exciting updates from the world of transportation this week. Stay tuned for more news and insights in future editions of TechCrunch Mobility.

That's it for this week's edition of TechCrunch Mobility. We hope you found these updates informative and engaging.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobinglis/2024/03/25/avoiding-the-judgment-of-history/,Avoiding The Judgment Of History,"Art Laffer, a well-known economist and former advisor to President Ronald Reagan, recently had a meeting with former President Trump to discuss the possibility of replacing Jerome Powell as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Interestingly, Laffer has been supportive of a revenue-neutral carbon tax as an effective market-based solution to combat climate change. This meeting took place at the same time when the U.S. House of Representatives passed a non-binding resolution condemning a carbon tax, despite it being considered the most powerful means of addressing climate change.

It is worth noting that a carbon tax can be designed in a way that it does not result in an expansion of the government. By pairing it with a reduction in an existing tax, it can be made revenue-neutral. Additionally, it can be made border-adjustable by applying the tax to imports from countries that have not implemented their own pollution taxes.

The irony lies in the fact that while the House passed the never-never-ever-ever carbon tax resolution, discussions were underway about potentially appointing Art Laffer or Kevin Hassett as replacements for Jerome Powell. Both Laffer and Hassett have advocated for a carbon tax coupled with a dollar-for-dollar reduction in existing taxes as a solution to climate change. They are members of the Pigou Club, a group founded by Greg Mankiw, a Harvard economist who served as Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush.

Arthur Cecil Pigou, the English economist who lived from 1877 to 1959, is known for suggesting that we should tax the things we want less of and untax the things we want more of. In this case, taxing carbon pollution while reducing taxes on payroll income could be a viable solution. This approach would address the concern of a carbon tax disproportionately affecting low-wage workers. Moreover, it would also strengthen Social Security by expanding its tax base.

It is evident that the drafters of the never-never-ever-ever carbon tax resolution lack awareness of existing World Trade Organization rules that allow for the application of a carbon tax on imports from countries without their own carbon tax. This is known as a border adjustment. Other countries would likely follow suit and impose carbon pollution fees in their own jurisdictions to avoid losing revenue to the United States. Consequently, the true cost of burning fossil fuels would be reflected in the prices of products. This would incentivize the production of greener and cleaner alternatives, making them more affordable compared to dirty products.

Arthur Cecil Pigou would be proud of this approach, as he argued that negative externalities, such as costs imposed on society by firms and individuals, create market distortions that hinder innovation. By holding polluters accountable through taxation, we can encourage the development of cleaner technologies and processes. This perspective aligns with the views of Dr. Milton Friedman, an economic advisor to President Reagan, who suggested taxing polluters during an appearance on the Phil Donahue Show in the 1980s.

It is important to recognize that both Republicans and Democrats have a responsibility to prioritize policy over politics when it comes to addressing climate change. While some Democrats also voted in favor of the never-never-ever-ever carbon tax resolution, it is encouraging that it was non-binding, allowing for corrections to be made. It is never too late for redemption and to rectify the mistakes of the past.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6601d28de733bba2fcac676c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 15:47:48,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/lesliekatz/2024/03/25/heres-proof-that-spiders-pretend-to-be-ants/,Hereâ€™s Fossilized Proof That Spiders Pretend To Be Ants,"In the world of nature, survival often depends on being able to avoid predators. And some creatures have developed incredibly creative strategies to stay alive. Take spiders, for example. These eight-legged arthropods have found a way to disguise themselves as ants in order to avoid being eaten by larger spiders, wasps, and birds.

But why ants? Well, ants are known for their aggressive defense mechanisms. They have a strong bite and can inject venom, making them unappetizing to other arthropods on the hunt for a meal. Additionally, ants can call in reinforcements from their nestmates, making them a formidable opponent. On the other hand, spiders lack chemical defenses and are solitary creatures, which makes them vulnerable to predation. By mimicking ants, spiders are more likely to go unnoticed and avoid becoming a meal themselves.

Recently, paleobiologist George Poinar Jr., a professor emeritus in the department of integrative biology at Oregon State University, made an exciting discovery. He described a new species of ant-mimicking spider that was found trapped in fossilized resin, also known as amber. This spider, preserved intact except for the tips of its legs, offers a rare glimpse into the past and sheds light on the adaptive behaviors of these fascinating creatures.

The study, published in the journal Historical Biology, reveals that ant-mimicking spiders can be found all over the world. However, they have managed to evade both fossil researchers and predators. This makes the discovery of this fossilized spider even more remarkable.

Sticky tree resin, when it hardens and fossilizes, becomes amber. This process often traps organisms, preserving them for millions of years. Poinar, who is no stranger to studying amber-preserved insects and other life forms, obtained the resin containing the spider from Medellin, Colombia. The copal block, a less mature form of amber, could not be age-tested using conventional methods without risking damage to the spider inside. Copal can be as old as 3 million years.

While the exact timeframe of when this spider attempted to masquerade as an ant remains unknown, the copal sample provides a unique fossilized record of this intriguing adaptive behavior.

Mimicry is a common strategy used by various creatures in nature to evade predators. Some animals change their colors to blend into their surroundings. But for spiders, which have eight legs and no antennae, mimicking ants is quite a challenge. Ant-mimicking spiders must reposition their front legs to resemble antennae. However, this is just one aspect of their transformation.

Spiders have their abdomen and cephalothorax closely attached, while ants have these body parts separated by a narrow segment called the petiole. Ant-mimicking spiders must modify many structures to closely resemble ants. Poinar suggests that this morphing process involves spider mutation, adaptation, and natural selection. However, he also believes that there might be some level of reasoning and intelligence involved, as spiders often model their body changes after specific ants in their environment.

While ant-mimicking spiders have certainly earned their place as nature's contortionists, their skills come at a cost. Other studies have shown that these elaborate disguises can impair the spiders' hunting abilities.

In conclusion, the discovery of a fossilized ant-mimicking spider provides valuable insights into the adaptive behaviors of these fascinating creatures. By disguising themselves as ants, spiders can avoid becoming prey for larger predators. While this strategy comes with its own disadvantages, such as reduced hunting abilities, it is a remarkable example of nature's ingenuity. The study conducted by Poinar adds to our understanding of mimicry and the complex interactions between different species in the natural world.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6601d75147f6aaf277e73ba1/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=527,297,x0,y132,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 15:28:10,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/elon-musk-x-ccdh-california-lawsuit-dismissed/,A judge just killed Elon Musk's lawsuit against an anti-hate research org,"A federal judge has ruled against Elon Musk and his company X in a lawsuit targeting the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), a nonprofit organization that researches online hate. The lawsuit, filed by X last year, accused CCDH of spreading misleading claims through its reports on hate and extremism on the platform. X claimed to have lost millions of dollars as a result of CCDH's research.

Musk and X also alleged that CCDH illegally scraped data and violated the platform's rules by aggregating content using a third-party social media monitoring tool called Brandwatch. Musk, who personally directed the lawsuit, referred to CCDH as ""an evil propaganda machine"" in his replies on X.

CCDH responded by filing a motion to dismiss X's claims under California's Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (SLAPP) law, which is aimed at preventing frivolous lawsuits intended to intimidate others. The organization also accused Musk of deliberately prolonging the legal process to increase its legal costs, pointing out that Musk's net worth is around $200 billion.

United States District Judge Charles R. Breyer, of the Northern District of California, granted CCDH's motion to dismiss the lawsuit and denied Musk and X the opportunity to reopen the case. In his ruling, Judge Breyer stated that it was clear that X had brought the case to punish CCDH for criticizing the company and to discourage others from doing the same.

The CCDH has been actively monitoring hate speech on social media platforms, particularly on Twitter since Musk's increased presence on the platform. The organization published a report highlighting the rise of hate speech after Musk unbanned several highly followed extremists, potentially boosting the company's ad revenue. One of the extremists mentioned in the report is Andrew Anglin, a notorious neo-Nazi who created the white supremacist website the Daily Stormer.

Established in 2018, CCDH conducts research on hate speech, extremism, and misinformation on major social networks. Its reports consistently expose disturbing content on various platforms, including TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram, covering topics such as eating disorder content, climate denial, and violent misogynistic threats.

CCDH CEO Imran Ahmed expressed satisfaction with the court's ruling, emphasizing the organization's commitment to holding social media companies accountable for their decisions that impact society. He stated, ""We create costs for lies and hate."" Ahmed also emphasized the importance of research, advocacy, and the protection of fundamental human rights and civil liberties.

CCDH's legal team included Roberta Kaplan, who recently achieved a significant victory against former President Donald Trump in the E. Jean Carroll defamation suit. Kaplan commented on the ruling, stating that it demonstrates that even the world's wealthiest man cannot manipulate the rule of law to his advantage.

Despite the victory in California, Musk is pursuing a similar lawsuit against the left-leaning media watchdog Media Matters for America. However, unlike the CCDH lawsuit, X is suing Media Matters for America in Texas, where the protections against frivolous lawsuits aimed at stifling free speech are not as strong as in California.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/twitter-x-logo-musk-pattern.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-25 20:33:17,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/match-board-directors-after-talks-activist-investor-elliott-management/,Match appoints two board directors after talks with activist investor Elliott Management,"Tinder-owner Match Group has recently made significant changes to its board of directors and entered into an agreement with activist investor Elliott Management. The company announced on Monday that Laura Jones, the chief marketing officer at Instacart, and Spencer Rascoff, co-founder of Zillow, will be joining the board with immediate effect.

According to Match, these appointments have come after a period of ""constructive dialogue"" with Elliott Management, during which the two companies have entered into an ""information-sharing"" agreement. This news follows a report by The Wall Street Journal a few months ago, which revealed that Elliott had acquired a stake of around $1 billion in Match Group. The report suggested that Elliott was interested in discussing strategies to improve Match's performance, as the company has experienced a decline in paying users due to economic uncertainty.

Marc Steinberg, a partner at Elliott, expressed his confidence in Match's potential for value creation as the global leader in online dating. He stated, ""We are one of the largest investors of Match Group today because we believe in its opportunity for significant value creation as the global leader in online dating. We appreciate the collaboration with management and the Board over the past several months, and we are confident that Laura Jones and Spencer Rascoff are strong additions to the Board. We believe their unique skills and perspectives will help support the Company through its next phase of growth.""

Elliott Management is known for acquiring stakes in tech companies and advocating for changes. Their push for change at Match Group follows similar board shakeups at Crown Castle and Etsy.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, Match Group experienced a 5% decrease in total paid users compared to the previous year, with a total of 15.2 million paid users. The company's growth has slowed down since the peak it reached during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a significant decline of 79% in its stock value since 2021.

Match Group is the parent company of various popular dating apps, including Tinder, Hinge, Match.com, Meetic, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, OurTime, and more. These apps have gained a large user base and have become well-known in the online dating industry.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1241790742.jpeg?w=1024,2024-03-25 14:15:04,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/dma-first-formal-probes/,"Apple, Google and Meta face first formal investigations under EU's DMA","The European Union has recently announced a series of investigations on Big Tech companies, specifically Alphabet/Google, Apple, and Meta, under the Digital Markets Act (DMA). These investigations mark the first formal non-compliance probes under the EU's revamped competition rulebook. The focus of the investigations includes Alphabet/Google's rules on steering in Google Play and self-preferencing in search results, Apple's rules on steering in the App Store and the design of choice screens, and Meta's ""pay or consent"" model.

These investigations come less than three weeks after the compliance deadline for the companies. The three gatekeepers, which were designated under the pan-EU market power and contestability regulation, face formal investigation to determine if they are breaching the rulebook. Violations of the DMA can result in fines of up to 10% of global annual turnover, or even 20% for repeat offenses. The EU will have up to 12 months to conclude the investigations, with a preliminary report potentially being produced within six months.

This enforcement action by the EU is happening alongside increased antitrust scrutiny on the three U.S. firms in their home country as well. Since the companies unveiled their DMA compliance plans, there has been criticism that their proposals do not comply with the new EU law. Google has faced accusations of attempting to avoid the regulation's ban on self-preferencing, while Apple's use of notifications to warn users of risks outside its ecosystem has been criticized by developers. Meta's ""pay or be tracked"" tactic has also been condemned by privacy and consumer rights groups.

The investigations specifically address concerns related to the DMA's requirements. The Commission is assessing whether Alphabet and Apple's measures in relation to their app stores breach the DMA, particularly in terms of allowing app developers to ""steer"" consumers to offers outside the gatekeepers' app stores free of charge. Google's self-preferencing in its vertical search services will also be scrutinized to evaluate its impact on rival services. The EU is examining whether Apple is complying with user choice obligations on iOS, such as enabling easy uninstallation of apps and changing default settings. The investigation on Meta focuses on its ""pay or consent"" model and whether it complies with the DMA's requirement to obtain user consent for cross-use of personal data.

The EU's internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, emphasized that the DMA clearly requires gatekeepers to offer a free, non-preferential choice to users. The investigations aim to ensure fair competition, protect consumer rights, and prevent the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers. The EU's actions reflect its commitment to regulating and overseeing the practices of Big Tech companies to ensure a level playing field in the digital market.

In conclusion, the European Union has launched investigations on Alphabet/Google, Apple, and Meta under the Digital Markets Act. These investigations focus on various aspects of the companies' practices, including self-preferencing, steering in app stores, and data usage. The EU is determined to enforce the DMA and ensure fair competition in the digital market.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1031626648.jpg?resize=1200,799",2024-03-25 12:10:10,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/gostudent-tutoring-profitability/,"GoStudent, the online learning platform, says it's now profitable","GoStudent, a leading online tutoring marketplace based in Vienna, Austria, has achieved profitability, marking a significant milestone for the company. With a valuation of $3.2 billion, GoStudent has established itself as one of the most successful startups in Austria, boasting a user base of 11 million families and 23,000 tutors. CEO Felix Ohswald proudly announced that the company is not only EBITDA profitable but also has positive operating cash flow.

While GoStudent's journey to profitability hasn't been without challenges, it has managed to overcome them. The online learning market experienced a crash, causing a sharp drop in customer demand. As a result, GoStudent incurred losses of â‚¬89 million in 2021, which escalated to â‚¬220 million in 2022. This led to several rounds of layoffs and cost-cutting measures. Despite these setbacks, GoStudent managed to turn things around.

Ohswald described the company's previous phase as a period of ""crazy"" hyper-scaling. Within just two years, GoStudent scaled its core business model to generate over â‚¬100 million in revenue. However, this rapid growth came at a cost, with a cash burn of over â‚¬150 million in 2022 alone. As the market conditions changed, GoStudent realized it needed to adjust its strategy to ensure long-term sustainability.

In 2023, GoStudent took steps to reduce its burn rate by 70%, but it became clear that further measures were necessary. The company implemented three rounds of layoffs and made difficult decisions to cut back on expenses. Parties and acquisitions were put on hold, and expansion into new markets was halted. GoStudent shifted its focus to Europe and adopted a more organic growth strategy. These changes were aimed at achieving bottom-line growth rather than top-line growth.

The COVID-19 pandemic played a significant role in GoStudent's success. The digital transformation prompted by the pandemic led to increased demand for online learning solutions, and GoStudent emerged as a leading provider of online tutoring services. The company went from having to convince parents of the benefits of online tutoring to becoming the go-to solution for students in need of educational support.

Despite its success, GoStudent recognized the need to become more cost-effective. While scaling at lower costs presents challenges, the company remains committed to its mission of building the number one global school and unlocking the potential of every student through personalized tutoring. GoStudent aims to strike a balance between cost-efficiency and maintaining a personalized approach to education.

To further its mission, GoStudent acquired Studienkreis in 2022. Studienkreis, founded in 1974, operates physical learning centers primarily in Germany. GoStudent plans to leverage these centers to enhance its hybrid learning approach. CEO Ohswald believes that the future of education is hybrid, combining technology with physical learning spaces. With a focus on personalized tutoring and leveraging technology, GoStudent aims to connect students with the right tutors regardless of location.

Most of GoStudent's tutors are university students, which facilitates a strong connection with their pupils while delivering quality education. This younger demographic brings a fresh and relatable perspective to the tutoring experience.

In conclusion, GoStudent's journey to profitability showcases its resilience and adaptability in the face of challenges. By implementing cost-cutting measures and refocusing its growth strategy, the company has positioned itself for continued success in the online tutoring market. GoStudent remains committed to its mission of providing personalized education and unlocking the potential of every student. With its hybrid learning approach and a focus on connecting students with the right tutors, GoStudent is poised to make a lasting impact on the education industry.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Founders-of-GoStudent-Gregor-Muller-I-Felix-Ohswald-2.jpg?w=1024,2024-03-25 11:00:36,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/london-regtech-gss-raises-47m-to-help-banks-screen-for-global-sanctions/,London regtech GSS raises $47M to help banks screen for global sanctions,"Global Screening Services (GSS), a London-based regulatory compliance platform, has successfully raised $47 million in funding. This comes at a time when economic sanctions are on the rise, with the United States imposing trade restrictions and asset blocking against countries like Russia, China, and Iran.

GSS was founded by Tom Scampion, who previously served as the head of financial crime for Deloitte's EMEA arm. In 2020, Scampion left Deloitte to become a general partner at consulting firm AlixPartner. It was during his time at AlixPartner that GSS was incubated before eventually spinning out as an independent entity in 2021.

Last year, GSS secured a similar amount of funding from prominent investors, including Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), one of the world's largest banks. In their most recent funding round, GSS announced the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) as a new backer, along with Cynosure Group and AlixPartner.

Financial institutions, particularly banks, often find themselves at the forefront of sanctions enforcement due to their role in global money flow. However, it can be challenging for banks to determine the origin and destination of funds. For instance, in 2019, Standard Chartered faced fines of $1.1 billion from regulators in the UK and the US for inadequate money-laundering controls and breaching sanctions against countries like Iran. Similarly, BNP Paribas was fined a staggering $8.9 billion in 2014 for processing financial transactions for US-sanctioned countries.

Given these challenges, investors have shown increased interest in regulatory compliance businesses. In recent years, companies like Droit and SteelEye have successfully raised millions of dollars to support their efforts in this space.

GSS offers a sanctions-screening platform that helps banks and other financial institutions comply with regulations. By feeding transaction data into GSS's cloud-based platform, these institutions receive alerts if any matches are found against a comprehensive set of sanctions lists from around the world. GSS also enriches these lists by adding additional data points such as dates of birth, International Maritime Organization (IMO) numbers for ships, and data from the financial transfer systems of sanctioned countries.

Furthermore, GSS provides enhanced lists for screening, which include companies that are partially owned by individuals, companies, or governments that have been sanctioned by entities like the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the European Union (EU), or the United Kingdom.

With the recent funding round, GSS is now transitioning from the development phase to becoming fully operational. The company is preparing to go live with its first customers and aims to help financial institutions meet their global sanctions obligations effectively.

In conclusion, Global Screening Services is making significant strides in the regulatory compliance space, providing financial institutions with the necessary tools to navigate the complexities of global sanctions. With its latest funding round and a strong lineup of backers, GSS is well-positioned to drive innovation and enhance compliance efforts in the financial industry.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1770041999-e1711386339681.jpg?resize=1200,677",2024-03-25 18:36:37,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-high-efficiency-based-copperiodide-clusters.html,A high efficiency LED based on copper-iodide clusters,"A team of researchers, led by Prof. Yao Hongbin from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), has made a significant breakthrough in the development of warm white light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Their work, which focuses on using copper-iodide cluster hybrids, has been published in Nature Photonics.

LED technology has become increasingly popular for its energy efficiency and versatility. Solution-processed LEDs, in particular, are considered to be the future of large-area solid-state lighting due to their simple manufacturing process and high operability. Various materials, such as lead-halide perovskites, organic semiconductor materials, and colloidal core-shell quantum dots (QDs), have been used to achieve high electroluminescence performance in solution-processed LED devices.

However, some of these materials, like lead-halide perovskites and CdSe QDs, contain heavy metals that pose serious environmental concerns. On the other hand, LED devices based on organic light-emitting molecules, InP QDs, and ZnSe QDs have high production costs due to the complexity of their synthesis. Therefore, the development of solution-processed LEDs based on low-cost, low-toxicity, easily scalable, and highly efficient emitters is crucial for the future of solid-state lighting.

To address this challenge, Prof. Yao's team focused on designing and preparing a copper-iodine-based hybrid cluster with a broad photoluminescence spectrum. They introduced nitrogen-phosphine chelating ligands and phosphine-containing solubilizing ligands to obtain copper-iodide hybrid clusters that exhibited both high luminescence efficiency and high solubility. These clusters demonstrated a solubility of over 200 mg/mL and good structural stability in N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF), a cross-solvent commonly used in LED production.

The team then fabricated luminescent thin films using spin-coating in DMF, which resulted in films with a low surface roughness of 0.22 nm and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of over 70%. These films can serve as a luminescent layer for the production of low-cost warm-white LED devices through an orthogonal solvent route.

The LED devices developed by the team achieved impressive results. They achieved a maximum external quantum efficiency of 19.1%, a brightness of over 40,000 cd m-2, and an operational lifetime of more than 232 hours (T 50 @100 cd m-2). Furthermore, thanks to the excellent solubility and processability of the clusters, the team successfully constructed a large-area solution-processed LED device with a working area of 36 cm2 through blade-coating. This device exhibited warm white light emission with a brightness close to 60,000 cd m-2.

In addition to their work on warm white LEDs, the team also developed a series of solution-processed color-tunable LED devices by modifying different electron-donating groups on the nitrogen heterocycles of the nitrogen-phosphine chelating ligands.

Overall, Prof. Yao's team has made significant progress in the development of high-efficiency and high-brightness LED devices based on copper-iodide hybrid clusters. The expandability and tunability of these clusters make them a promising candidate for the fabrication of low-cost, high-performance LED panels and solid-state lighting.

This breakthrough not only provides a more sustainable and cost-effective solution for solid-state lighting but also opens up new possibilities for the future of LED technology. The research conducted by Prof. Yao and his team is a testament to the power of innovation and collaboration in advancing scientific knowledge and driving technological advancements.
