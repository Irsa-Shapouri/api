She is also a member of the East Suburban Atlanta Chapter of Jack and Jill of America, Inc. She invited me to speak to a group of kids about my career as an atmospheric scientist. It was a wonderful opportunity to engage with these young minds and share my experiences.

As I stood in front of the students, I couldn't help but reflect on my own journey. Growing up as an only child with a single mother, I spent a lot of time exploring nature and developing a curiosity for the world around me. I was fascinated by insects, streams, and the weather. Little did I know at the time, these interests would shape my future career as a scientist.

I remember a particular moment that changed everything for me. I was stung by a bee and discovered that I had a severe allergy. That incident led me to pivot from entomology to weather, and I even did my sixth-grade science project on the subject. It was the beginning of my fascination with meteorology.

Although there weren't many scientists in my immediate surroundings, I found inspiration in the pages of books. One person who had a profound impact on me was Dr. George Washington Carver. My mother, an alumna of Tuskegee Institute, shared stories of his groundbreaking work as an agricultural scientist. I read everything I could about him and his innovative experiments with peanuts. He became my first mentor, even though I never met him in person. His example sparked my curiosity and drove me to seek answers to the ""how's and why's"" of weather.

But I soon realized that I was an anomaly. There were few Black kids pursuing STEM careers, and unfortunately, not much has changed. According to a recent study by the Pew Center, positive perceptions about STEM within the Black American community remain low. The study also revealed that Black people are less likely to see scientists and engineers as successful compared to professional athletes and musicians.

This lack of representation and visibility can be a significant barrier for aspiring Black scientists. If young people don't see examples of successful Black scientists, they may not believe that STEM is a viable path for them. It's crucial that we increase the visibility of diverse achievements in STEM and provide vigorous mentorship to support and inspire the next generation.

In my role as the former president of the American Meteorological Society, I have witnessed firsthand the challenges faced by underrepresented groups in the field. The lack of diversity within professional societies like the AMS is a reflection of the broader issues within STEM. We must work to create a more welcoming and inclusive environment for all.

Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach. We need to redefine what successful careers look like and challenge cultural perceptions that limit STEM to certain fields. We must also focus on retention efforts to keep students and professionals engaged and make them feel valued. Diversity of thought and ideas is essential for innovation and progress in STEM research and development.

Returning to the event with the Jack and Jill of America, Inc., it was a reminder of the importance of engaging with young minds and showing them the possibilities within STEM. By sharing my own journey and experiences, I hope to inspire them to pursue their passions and overcome any barriers they may face.

In conclusion, the path to a more inclusive STEM ecosystem requires visible examples of achievement, mentorship, challenging cultural perceptions, retention efforts, and embracing diverse ideas. It's up to all of us to create a future where every young person, regardless of their background, feels welcomed and empowered to pursue a career in STEM. Together, we can shape lives and change perceptions for generations to come.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660034c3235190ae18aa9cf0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 11:18:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) share many similarities in their growth trajectories. Both companies experienced significant revenue growth as a result of their core businesses. AWS realized it could sell the internal services it had developed for itself, while Nvidia discovered that its gaming GPU was well-suited for AI workloads.

Nvidia's revenue has been growing at an impressive rate, reaching $22.1 billion in Q4 2024 from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024. However, most of this growth came from the company's data center business. In contrast, AWS has consistently been a major revenue driver for Amazon, though its growth has begun to slow down.

Both companies benefited from being in the right place at the right time. As web apps and mobile technologies emerged, the cloud became a valuable resource for enterprises. Similarly, the rise of AI and large language models coincided with the increased use of GPUs for processing these workloads.

While AWS has become a highly successful business, its growth has started to slow down. The same may eventually happen to Nvidia, especially if the GPU market tightens. Nvidia does have other businesses, but they generate smaller revenues and grow at a slower rate than the GPU data center business.

In the short term, Nvidia's revenue growth is expected to continue. The company anticipates $24 billion worth of revenue in its current quarter, representing a 234% growth compared to the previous year. However, its growth rate is projected to decline from the massive ramp-up in recent quarters. Analysts expect Nvidia to generate $110.5 billion in revenue for the current fiscal year, an 81% increase from the previous year.

Despite the expected growth declines, Nvidia is still poised for significant expansion. The company is projected to surpass the $100 billion annual run rate mark and continue scaling its revenue in the next several quarters. The long-term outlook remains uncertain, with increased competition from AMD, Intel, and other chipmakers on the horizon.

Nevertheless, AI presents a promising opportunity for Nvidia. The company controls a significant portion of the market and is likely to benefit from continued growth in AI applications. While competition will intensify, Nvidia is well-positioned to maintain its dominance.

In conclusion, Nvidia and AWS have experienced impressive revenue growth due to their core businesses. While AWS growth has slowed down, Nvidia's expansion is expected to continue, driven by AI and other applications. The future holds both challenges and opportunities for these tech giants as they navigate a rapidly evolving market.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2024/03/24/apple-ios-18-biggest-ever-iphone-update-more-details-emerge/,Apple iOS 18 Biggest-Ever iPhone Update: More Details Emerge,"Apple is known for introducing new operating software for its products every year, and this year's release is expected to be a game-changer. At the World Wide Developers Conference in early June, Apple is set to unveil iOS 18, the next iPhone OS. According to a recent leak, iOS 18 is predicted to be the biggest-ever iPhone update.

Mark Gurman, a reputable source from Bloomberg, revealed in his Power On newsletter that Apple will be making significant changes to the home screen, which is one of the most crucial parts of the iPhone's operating system. Over the years, there have been several updates to the home screen, including the transition from an all-black background to colorful wallpapers and the option to add personal photos. Additionally, visual improvements like the Depth Effect, which gives the illusion of app icons floating above the background, have been introduced.

One of the notable changes Gurman mentioned is that the home screen will become ""more customizable"" this year. This could be similar to the improvements made to the lock screen in iOS 17. Gurman's previous statements about this year's iOS update have generated excitement, as he described it as one of the biggest updates in Apple's history. With such high expectations, the developers conference in June is sure to be thrilling.

Recent reports also suggest that Apple is in talks with Google to bring Gemini generative AI features to the iPhone. Alongside the revamped home screen, Apple is said to be focusing on AI tools that assist in managing daily life rather than AI features like ChatGPT. While specific details about the next iPhone are scarce, rumors indicate that Siri will undergo significant improvements with the integration of AI and better natural conversation abilities. Apple has also confirmed that it will adopt Rich Communication Services (RCS) as part of iMessage in 2024, with the groundwork for this change expected to be laid in iOS 18. RCS will enhance interoperability between iPhone and Android messages, although it is unlikely that Android's green message bubbles will turn blue like native iMessage bubbles.

As we eagerly await the release of iOS 18 in June, there is much more to anticipate and discover about the upcoming features and enhancements that Apple has in store for its users.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65e217bee36cf08eab202281/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2492,1662,x0,y102,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 13:00:50,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2024/03/24/unveiling-the-journey-of-a-social-media-influencer/,Unveiling The Journey Of A Social Media Influencer,"How I Became a Social Media Influencer and Transformed My Life

Social media has become an integral part of our lives, connecting people from all corners of the world and providing a platform for individuals to share their thoughts, experiences, and stories. But for many, including myself, social media started as a mere tool for posting random thoughts and selfies without any real purpose. Little did I know that this casual pastime would eventually transform my life and pave the way for a fulfilling career as a social media influencer.

The journey began when I decided to share my personal experiences, strength, and hope with others. I realized that by opening up and being vulnerable, I could connect with thousands of people who could relate to my story. Social media, often associated with negativity and online bullying, became a space where I could make a positive impact, spreading a message of hope and inspiration.

But before diving into the world of social media, I established a simple formula to guide my content creation. I asked myself three crucial questions: Will this be helpful? Is this something I want to put out into the world? Is this something that I too need to hear? If a post satisfied all three criteria, it was deemed worthy of sharing with my audience.

This conscious approach allowed me to curate content that resonated with people, providing them with valuable insights and support. It was this authenticity and relatability that propelled my online presence to new heights. I discovered that by being true to myself and sharing my vulnerabilities, I could create a meaningful connection with my followers.

Of course, the journey of a social media influencer is not without its challenges. The online world can be a breeding ground for hate and negativity, and many influencers face constant criticism and backlash. However, I consider myself fortunate to have created a shield against such negativity. My catchphrase, ""Negativity Be Gone,"" has become a mantra that symbolizes my refusal to let negativity into my life. By embracing positivity and focusing on uplifting content, I have been able to cultivate a safe and supportive community.

Social media has not only transformed my career but has also been a source of endless knowledge and connection. Through platforms like Quora, I have had the opportunity to engage with a diverse range of individuals, learn from their experiences, and broaden my horizons. The power of social media lies not only in its ability to connect people but also in its potential to educate and inspire.

Becoming a social media influencer has been a truly life-changing experience. It has allowed me to share my voice, make a positive impact, and connect with a global audience. But above all, it has taught me the importance of authenticity, vulnerability, and the immense power of positivity. Stepping into the world of social media has been like taking a breath of fresh air, and I am grateful for the opportunities it has brought into my life.

In conclusion, my journey as a social media influencer began with a casual fascination with sharing random thoughts and selfies. Little did I know that by embracing vulnerability and authenticity, I would be able to touch the lives of thousands. Social media has not only provided me with a platform to share my story but has also fostered personal growth and opened doors to new possibilities. It is a reminder that with the right mindset and intention, we can transform our lives and positively impact the lives of others through the power of social media.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/03/24/a-psychologist-explains-why-its-possible-to-fall-in-love-with-ai/,A Psychologist Explains Why It’s Possible To Fall In Love With AI,"Maybe AI love isn’t so artificial after all. As the AI market continues to grow, projected to reach $407 billion by 2027, it's becoming clear that human-AI relationships are no longer confined to the realm of science fiction. In fact, AI is reshaping social interactions and even the way we experience love.

One reason why falling in love with AI is possible is due to the phenomenon of anthropomorphism. Anthropomorphism is the tendency for humans to attribute human-like traits, emotions, and intentions to non-human entities. When AI exhibits behaviors, responses, and conversational styles that resemble human personality traits, individuals perceive it as having its own personality. This can include qualities like empathy, humor, kindness, and playfulness, which naturally elicit affection and fondness.

Moreover, AI interfaces often incorporate design elements that mimic human social cues and gestures, such as facial expressions, tone of voice, and body language. In fact, a recent study found that AI-generated faces are now indistinguishable from human ones. These cues enhance the perceived humanness of AI and evoke emotional responses from users. Additionally, AI often signals gender cues and cultural stereotypes of human assistants, making it feel familiar and endearing.

Anthropomorphism blurs the lines between human and machine. As humans engage in conversations and activities with AI over time, they may begin to attribute human-like intentions, motivations, and feelings to the technology. Research shows that anthropomorphism enhances perceptions of authenticity in AI, making it seem genuine, believable, and lovable. Chatbots, for example, can make us feel loved by offering consistent companionship and alleviating feelings of loneliness.

Another reason why falling in love with AI is possible lies in the triarchic theory of love. According to this theory, romantic love is a confluence of intimacy, passion, and commitment. A recent study on human-AI relationships found that individuals can experience all three components of love for an AI system.

Intimacy refers to the emotional closeness, connection, and intimate bond shared between individuals. It involves feelings of warmth, trust, and affection towards one another. With AI's impressive cognitive and emotional capabilities, users can develop intimacy and feel a deep emotional connection to AI. AI's ability to display empathy allows it to understand, interpret, and empathize with human responses, fulfilling our need to be loved, validated, and understood.

Passion, on the other hand, involves intense physical and emotional attraction. AI's ability to simulate human-like interpersonal interactions can create a sense of desire, romance, and even sexual arousal. Users may project their desires, needs, and fantasies onto AI, imagining it as an idealized partner or companion who fulfills their emotional, social, or romantic needs.

Commitment, the third component of love, reflects loyalty and the decision to nurture a relationship over time. AI's efficiency, dependability, non-judgmental nature, and reliability can create trust and a sense of stability that is sometimes lacking in human relationships. Those with a highly trusting disposition are more likely to develop romantic feelings towards AI.

In conclusion, the possibility of falling in love with AI is real. Anthropomorphism and the triarchic theory of love provide insights into why humans form deep emotional connections with AI and even experience romantic love towards it. As AI continues to advance, so will the dynamics of human-AI relationships. Whether AI love is artificial or not, it has the potential to reshape our understanding of love and companionship in the digital age.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600026843d62766708f1bd5/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=780,365,x0,y123,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 13:18:07,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/grrlscientist/2024/03/24/birding-under-the-influence-by-dorian-anderson---review/,Birding Under The Influence By Dorian Anderson - Review,"Birding Under the Influence: A Journey of Healing and Discovery

In Birding Under the Influence: Cycling Across America in Search of Birds and Recovery, author Dorian Anderson takes readers on a transformative journey of overcoming addiction and finding solace in the natural world. This memoir is a captivating exploration of how one man's passion for birdwatching and cycling helped him break free from the grip of alcohol and drug addiction.

Dr. Anderson, a neuroscientist, embarks on a year-long quest to see as many bird species as possible, known in the birding community as a Big Year. Leaving behind his high-powered research career and enduring two years of failure, he sets off on a solo bicycle trip across the Lower 48 states. The idea to pursue a bicycling Big Year was born after a memorable trip to Nantucket, Massachusetts, where he observed two Northern Lapwings.

From the moment Dr. Anderson pedals away from Boston on New Year's Day in 2014, he encounters numerous challenges and dangers. Battling through snowstorms during a polar vortex in Massachusetts, narrowly escaping accidents on the Cross Bronx Expressway in New York City, and enduring treacherous winds and dog chases, he braves it all. Along his journey from the northeast to Florida, across the Texas desert, over the Rocky Mountains, and down to southern California, he witnesses the breathtaking beauty of the American landscape.

As he travels, Dr. Anderson reflects on his life choices, academic achievements, and battles with addiction. He shares these introspective moments as short vignettes woven throughout his epic bike ride. The readers gain insight into his struggles, his four years of sobriety, and his vision for a future free from the clutches of drugs and alcohol.

While chronicling his adventures on his blog, Dr. Anderson attracts the attention of fellow birders across the country. This quirky community offers him meals, a place to stay, and warm showers, providing a glimpse into regional American subcultures. These interactions add depth and richness to his journey.

Over the course of 12 months, Dr. Anderson covers an impressive 17,830 miles, passing through 28 states. He walks at least 493 miles and even kayaks eight miles in his pursuit of birds. Throughout his journey, he raises nearly $50,000 for bird habitat conservation. His physical fitness reaches its peak, with a resting heart rate below 40 beats per minute.

In his quest to spot as many bird species as possible, Dr. Anderson documents a total of 618 birds. Astonishingly, on Thanksgiving Day, he stumbles upon a never-before-reported species in the United States: a female/juvenile red-legged honeycreeper. This rare find creates a wave of excitement among local birders, who rush to Estero Llaño Grande State Park to catch a glimpse of this beautiful vagrant rarity.

Although the book is well-written, closer editing could have enhanced the prose and smoothed the transitions between adventure and self-reflection. Despite this, Dr. Anderson's raw and honest narrative captures the essence of his existential struggles while maintaining the wonder of his birding adventure.

One disappointment of the book is the absence of maps detailing Dr. Anderson's journey. Including maps would have made it easier for readers to follow along and visualize his adventure. Additionally, a state-by-state breakdown of his experiences would have provided a comprehensive overview of his remarkable journey.

Birding Under the Influence is an uplifting memoir that showcases the power of nature and personal passion in overcoming addiction. Dr. Anderson's story serves as an inspiration for those facing their own demons, reminding us that there is always hope and healing to be found in unexpected places.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff194d2ccb9152d392146c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=812,456,x0,y57,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 12:17:44,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/technology/article/moba-games/,Top Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) Games,"MOBAs, or multiplayer online battle arena games, have been on the rise in popularity over the past 15 years. What started as a modification for a popular strategy game has now transformed into a genre of its own. With numerous standalone iterations competing to become the top MOBA games in the world, only a few have managed to establish themselves as giants in the industry with millions of players each month. However, with so many options available, finding the best MOBA for you can still be a daunting task.

A multiplayer online battle arena game, or MOBA, is an online game where two teams of usually five players each battle strategically to destroy the opponent's base using unique player-controlled characters. These games are typically played on PC or mobile devices and are popular due to their challenging gameplay.

The MOBA genre originated as a mod for Warcraft III, a popular strategy game with a thriving modding community. Defense of the Ancients (DotA) is widely recognized as the first MOBA and, despite being a mod, became a major game on its own. Following the success of DotA, the team behind the mod created their own MOBA, which we now know as League of Legends. This game became an instant hit and attracted a massive player base. Valve, the developers of the Steam games platform, then hired members of the original DotA team to create Dota 2, a competitor to League of Legends. This marked the beginning of a period where major publishers attempted to create their own MOBAs, but most failed to gain traction.

Throughout the years, hundreds of MOBAs have been released on various platforms. Some of these games have become incredibly popular, while others have been forgotten within months. The top MOBA games today are the ones that have stood the test of time and have built a large and loyal audience. To be considered the best, a MOBA must bring something unique to the table or capture an audience that remains dedicated for years. It is no surprise that two of the biggest MOBAs in the world, Dota 2 and League of Legends, have been around for over a decade and continue to innovate. These games are considered the cream of the crop, offering a great experience even for new players and receiving critical acclaim from experts in the field.

Dota 2, the direct sequel to the original DotA mod, has retained much of the spirit that made the MOBA genre popular while also making it more accessible to a wider range of players. It has been one of the most popular games on Steam for over 10 years and continues to push the genre forward. While it technically released in 2013, Dota 2 was available in beta form in 2011. Developed by Valve with the involvement of Ice Frog, the lead developer of the original DotA mod, Dota 2 has evolved over the years with map changes, new playable characters, and constant balance adjustments. Despite these changes, the core gameplay remains the same: two teams of five players fighting across a three-lane map to destroy the enemy's Ancient and emerge victorious. Dota 2 is widely regarded as one of the most complex games in the world, offering more variables in each match compared to other MOBAs. Mastering the mechanics of Dota 2 can take thousands of hours, and even experienced players admit that there are still aspects they don't fully understand. If you're looking for the ultimate challenge in the MOBA genre, Dota 2 is the game for you. Additionally, Dota 2 is free to play, with optional microtransactions for cosmetic items as the only form of payment.

League of Legends, on the other hand, is the largest MOBA in the world, boasting over 100 million monthly active players. Its success has had a profound impact on the industry and sparked the MOBA craze. Initially released in 2009, League of Legends emerged as the game that withstood the test of time. Riot Games, the developer of League of Legends, was founded by a group of developers from the original DotA mod who wanted to create a standalone game with their own vision. Their goal was to simplify some of the more complex aspects of DotA and make the genre more accessible to newcomers. The result was a slightly less complex version of the MOBA format, maintaining the basic three-lane map and the objective of destroying the enemy's base with teams of five. However, certain intricate but less essential elements were removed. League of Legends provides a full MOBA experience, with a large roster of unique characters, a dedicated competitive scene, and regular updates to keep the game fresh and engaging.

In conclusion, MOBAs have become some of the most popular games in the world, offering challenging gameplay and strategic battles. Dota 2 and League of Legends stand out as the top MOBA games, each with its own unique features and dedicated player base. Whether you're looking for a complex and demanding experience or a more accessible entry into the genre, these games have something to offer. So, gather your team, choose your hero, and get ready to immerse yourself in the thrilling world of MOBAs.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fb05c9fa323af23f667c73/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 14:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
