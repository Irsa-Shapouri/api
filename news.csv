https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/23/google-upgrade-samsung-s24-s23-pixel-towards-apple-iphone-15-pro-max/,Google Suddenly Reveals Surprise Android Update That Beats iPhone,"Android and iPhone have become more similar than ever before, with both operating systems and their devices offering comparable features. However, Google has recently taken a leap ahead of Apple by introducing a groundbreaking new feature that will initially be available on Android. This feature is set to revolutionize the smartphone industry and could be just around the corner.

Google's goal is to make Android more like iPhone as the two leading smartphone ecosystems compete for users. In recent times, Google has made several enhancements to Android, including improving its security measures, integrating WhatsApp calls into its phone dialer, and even adding Apple passes to its wallet. Now, with its latest update, Google not only matches an existing feature on the iPhone but goes a step further, surpassing Apple at its own game.

One notable feature that Google has recently introduced is an emergency satellite service, which brings Android on par with the satellite SOS functionality that Apple has had on its iPhone for a few years. Google's offering even includes a ready-made Garmin rescue service, making it a significant step forward in ensuring the safety and security of its vast user base.

However, Apple's emergency SOS feature is limited to emergency situations. For those of us who are not mountaineers or sailors, the SOS tag on the screen when we are out of coverage is something we never use. Google's latest Android 15 developer preview aims to bridge this gap by allowing users to expand their cellular accounts to include a satellite add-on. This update also enables core messaging apps to use the satellite network, eliminating the frustration of cellular black spots and connectivity issues.

According to Mishaal Rahman, Android 15 DP2 introduces UI elements to ensure a consistent user experience for devices that support satellite connectivity. Additionally, the update expands platform support for satellite connectivity by adding a new API that apps can use to detect when a device is connected to a satellite. Android 15 also allows SMS/MMS/RCS apps to utilize satellite connectivity for sending and receiving messages.

The most significant aspect of this update is the messaging integration, and we know that some networks have plans to offer LEO satellite connectivity as an account option. This improvement exceeds our initial expectations when Google prematurely updated Pixel phones with a ""Satellite SOS"" feature placed between Car Crash Detection and Emergency SOS.

Compared to Apple's satellite connectivity, Android's capabilities are more extensive. Apple states that with certain iPhone models, users can connect their phones to a satellite to text emergency services, request roadside assistance, and share their location with friends and family when there is no mobile or Wi-Fi coverage. Android, on the other hand, may go even further, as previous beta code hinted at a satellite messaging option in collaboration with T-Mobile. Elon Musk's announcement of SpaceX achieving download speeds of 17mbps to an unmodified Galaxy S21 Ultra further fueled speculation about the potential of satellite connectivity.

While the idea of direct-to-phone satellite connectivity becoming more accessible and mainstream is exciting, messaging integration is an excellent starting point. The inclusion of this feature in Android 15 appears to be confirmed, barring any major changes. As Android and iPhone continue to converge, it seems that Google is taking the lead, with Apple likely to follow suit. This development comes shortly after the news that Gemini might be coming to iPhone, and Apple's claim that the DOJ lawsuit would essentially turn iPhone into Android, making it an eventful week in the smartphone industry.

Update 3/23: Exciting new details about Google's plans for satellite messaging have emerged shortly after the news broke about Gemini potentially coming to Apple's iPhone. This development is interesting for several reasons. Not only does it bring Android and iPhone closer together, but it also enhances Google's role within the iPhone ecosystem.

In terms of the Android vs. iPhone competition, one notable aspect is the deployment of Gemini on Android devices. While Apple users eagerly await details about the next OS update in the fall, Android users can enjoy the benefits of this innovative feature.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65d79ec3dadcd6b682668331/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-23 19:17:25,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/apple-sued-microsofts-ai-ambitions-and-nvidia-surprises/,"Apple sued, Microsoft's AI ambitions and Nvidia's surprises","Welcome to this edition of Week in Review, where we bring you the latest updates on tech news. In this week's edition, we have some significant developments in the Apple antitrust lawsuit and Microsoft's AI ambitions. So, let's jump right in!

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has accused Apple of engaging in monopolistic practices to lock in iPhone users. However, Apple has defended itself by stating that the DOJ's actions could potentially harm what its users love about its phones and ecosystem.

The lawsuit draws parallels between Apple and Microsoft during the 1990s, although there are notable differences in how the two companies have sought to retain customers.

It is important to note that this lawsuit is unlikely to reach a resolution in the near future. Experts predict that it could take anywhere from three to five years to come to a conclusion.

Moving on to other news, Microsoft made headlines this week with its acquisition of Inflection AI. The co-founders of the AI startup, Mustafa Suleyman and Karén Simonyan, have joined Microsoft. Suleyman will now lead the consumer-facing unit Microsoft AI, while Simonyan has taken on the role of EVP and CEO of the same group. This acquisition comes after Inflection raised a staggering $1.3 billion, with Microsoft being one of the largest investors.

Nvidia also made waves this week with its GTC event. While the company is known for its advancements in ray tracing technology, CEO Jensen Huang surprised attendees with talks about artificial general intelligence being just five years away. He also announced a new AI platform for humanoid robots called GR00T.

In a surprising development, Google is reportedly in talks with Apple to deploy its AI model on upcoming iOS updates. This raises questions about whether this partnership will be temporary until Apple's own AI efforts catch up, or if it will lead to a long-term collaboration between the two tech giants.

Moving on to hacking and privacy, the Biden administration is rallying an international coalition to combat commercial spyware. Interestingly, some investors who have joined this coalition were previously involved in the very business they are now fighting against.

In the gaming world, a recent hack brought an Apex Legends tournament to a standstill. The hackers claimed that their intention was to expose the exploit used and highlight it to the developers.

Glassdoor users have also reported concerning issues with their accounts. Some have found that their real names were added to their profiles without their consent. The only solution provided by Glassdoor is to delete the entire account, which has left users frustrated.

Turning to funding and IPOs, Reddit's IPO had a successful start. The stock launched at $34 per share and saw a 48% increase on its first day, closing at $46.

Astera Labs, a company that specializes in connectivity hardware for cloud computing data centers, also had a strong start. Its revenue grew by 45% to $115.8 million last year, and its stock closed at $62.03 on the first day.

The Browser Company, the startup behind the Arc browser, raised $50 million at a valuation of $550 million. While the company has been making strides with feature launches and AI updates, its path to monetization remains uncertain.

In our bonus round, we explore the limitations of AI when it comes to spelling. Despite its vast potential, AI still struggles with basic spelling, as we discovered in our deep dive into the word ""burrito.""

Lastly, Fisker, an electric vehicle company, has temporarily paused production due to financial constraints. If the company is unable to secure additional funding, it may have to cease operations.

In conclusion, this week has been eventful in the tech world, with the Apple antitrust lawsuit and Microsoft's AI acquisition making headlines. We also saw notable developments in AI, hacking, and funding. Stay tuned for more exciting news in the weeks to come!","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/apple-antitrust-doj-splash.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-23 20:15:37,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianmazique/2024/03/23/ufcs-dana-white-cuts-fighter-immediately-after-he-bit-an-opponent/,UFC’s Dana White Cuts Fighter Immediately After He Bit An Opponent,"Pressure and combat sports can drive people to do unexpected and outrageous things. A recent incident at UFC Fight Night: Ribas vs. Namajunas serves as a perfect example of this.

During his UFC debut, Igor Severino shocked everyone by biting his opponent, fellow Brazilian Andre Lima, in the second round of their preliminary bout. The bite, which was clearly visible through images showing bite marks, occurred while Severino had Lima in a standing grappling position.

Severino, a 20-year-old fighter with a promising future in the UFC, may have just thrown away his chance at success in the promotion. His actions on Saturday night will undoubtedly make it difficult for him to earn back the trust and respect of the organization.

As a result of his disqualification, Severino suffered the first loss of his career, dropping his record to 9-1. Meanwhile, Lima maintained his undefeated streak, improving his record to 8-0.

UFC CEO Dana White wasted no time in making a decision regarding Severino's future. He immediately announced that Severino would be cut from the promotion. ""Those were two up-and-coming undefeated fighters,"" White expressed through KevinIole.com. ""If you feel frustrated and want to exit a fight, there are plenty of acceptable ways to do so. Biting your opponent is the worst thing you can do. Now, Severino not only loses this huge opportunity but also faces potential repercussions from the NSAC.""

Unfortunately, biting incidents have occurred in combat sports before, and each time it happens, it is equally appalling. What sets this apart is Lima's response. Despite being the victim of the bite, he displayed an extraordinary level of composure. He calmly informed the referee about the incident, triggering a brief investigation into the foul play.

For Severino, the road to redemption will be long and challenging. It is highly likely that he will need to rebuild his reputation by competing in smaller promotions before he can even dream of returning to the UFC, Professional Fighters League, or any other reputable mixed martial arts organization.

As the events of Saturday's fights in Las Vegas come to a close, stay tuned for more traditional results and updates.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff92c285143669667fa59c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3188,1794,x0,y217,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-23 22:45:24,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2024/03/23/the-invisible-shield-aims-to-makes-public-health-more-visible/,‘The Invisible Shield’ Aims To Makes Public Health More Visible,"Anthony Chen, MD (R), former Director of Health for the Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department, played a crucial role in supporting Tacoma’s Shiloh Baptist Church during the Covid-19 pandemic. The relationship between Dr. Chen and Gregory Christopher, Senior Pastor of the church, highlighted the importance of public health in community safety. The upcoming PBS series, “The Invisible Shield,” sheds light on the often overlooked but vital work of public health professionals.

Comparing the public health system to an invisible shield, the series emphasizes how these professionals work tirelessly to protect communities from various health threats. While public health efforts may go unnoticed when successful, the Covid-19 pandemic exposed the vulnerabilities of underfunded and underappreciated systems. Kelly Henning, MD, of Bloomberg Philanthropies, underscores the critical role of public health in safeguarding public well-being.

Despite increased attention during the pandemic, public health systems continue to face challenges due to misinformation and inadequate resources. The series, produced by RadicalMedia with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies, aims to raise awareness of the importance of public health amidst the noise of celebrity endorsements and commercial promotions. Recognizing the impact of public health initiatives, such as vaccination programs and clean water supplies, is essential for understanding their contribution to overall well-being.

In the trailer for “The Invisible Shield,” Josh Sharfstein, MD, of Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, highlights the often unseen role of public health in saving lives. The first episode, “The Old Playbook,” explores the historical advancements in public health that have led to a doubling of life expectancy since 1900. Despite these achievements, the episode also addresses the current challenges facing the public health system and the risks of potential collapse.

While the series may not cover every aspect of public health history, it serves as a reminder of the critical role these professionals play in safeguarding public health. By highlighting the importance of public health initiatives and the need for continued support, “The Invisible Shield” encourages viewers to appreciate the impact of public health efforts on daily life.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff76b9cc324c33ed5484d7/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-23 21:25:08,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/23/explained-the-difference-between-a-solar-eclipse-and-a-lunar-eclipse/,Explained: The Difference Between A Solar Eclipse And A Lunar Eclipse,"Do you understand the distinction between a solar eclipse and a lunar eclipse? Two intriguing celestial events are on the horizon—a lunar eclipse on March 25 and a solar eclipse on April 8. Despite their differences, both are the result of a unique alignment of celestial bodies.

A lunar eclipse occurs when Earth's shadow falls on the moon, while a solar eclipse happens when the moon obstructs the sun's light, casting a shadow on Earth. These phenomena are rare due to the slight variance in the orbital planes of Earth and the moon.

The mechanics behind a lunar eclipse involve Earth positioning itself between the sun and the moon during a full moon, projecting a shadow into space. Although full moons occur every 29 days, lunar eclipses are infrequent occurrences.

Conversely, a solar eclipse transpires during a new moon when the moon stands between Earth and the sun, casting a shadow on our planet. This event, too, is a rarity, happening only when the moon blocks the sun's light from our perspective on Earth.

The occurrence of a total lunar eclipse necessitates a flawless alignment of the sun, Earth, and moon. When the moon enters Earth's umbra, it receives refracted sunlight, resulting in a breathtaking spectacle known as a ""Blood Moon."" The moon's surface takes on a pinkish-red hue, akin to experiencing a thousand sunsets simultaneously.

In contrast, a total solar eclipse requires the perfect alignment of the sun, moon, and Earth, allowing the moon's umbra to be projected onto our planet. This shadow moves across Earth's surface, creating a path of totality where observers witness the moon obscuring the sun entirely.

Eclipses are infrequent due to the moon's tilted orbit, intersecting the sun's path twice each month. However, solar and lunar eclipses can only occur during the new or full moon phases, resulting in two eclipse seasons annually. Most solar eclipses are partial or annular, while lunar eclipses are typically penumbral or partial.

Mark your calendars for the upcoming eclipse seasons in 2024 and 2025, featuring a mix of lunar and solar eclipses visible in various regions. These celestial events offer a unique opportunity to witness the wonders of our universe firsthand.

Stay informed about the upcoming total solar eclipse on April 8 in North America by checking for new articles on this topic. May your skies be clear and your eyes wide open to the marvels of the cosmos.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65f6b43702078076f68d7fcf/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-23 19:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/24/debunked-i-think-ive-seen-a-total-solar-eclipse-before/,Debunked: ‘I Think I’ve Seen A Total Solar Eclipse Before’,"Total Solar Eclipses in North America: A Once-in-a-Lifetime Experience

If you believe you've witnessed a total solar eclipse, think again. The truth is, very few people have truly experienced this rare celestial event. As the excitement builds before a total solar eclipse, many mistakenly recall seeing one in the past. However, what they likely witnessed was a partial solar eclipse, which occurs regularly across the globe.

The distinction is crucial because witnessing a total solar eclipse is an unforgettable experience. Only one in 10,000 individuals ever have the opportunity to see totality, where the moon completely obscures the sun. It's a moment that leaves a lasting impression, not a vague memory from years ago. To witness totality, you must be within the path of totality, the specific area on Earth where the moon fully blocks the sun. If you were not within this path, you only saw a partial solar eclipse.

The recent ""Great American Eclipse"" in 2017 brought totality to 12 U.S. states, captivating millions with its breathtaking beauty. If you were fortunate enough to be on the path of totality, you would remember the awe-inspiring sight of the sun's corona shining brightly around the dark silhouette of the moon. It's a memory that stays with you forever.

If you're unsure whether you've truly seen a total solar eclipse, there are ways to verify your experience. By using the Solar Eclipses Visibility Database, you can confirm the date and location of the eclipse you remember. Additionally, a list of all total solar eclipses in North America over the past 70 years can provide clarity on whether you witnessed totality.

Looking ahead to April 8, 2024, a rare total solar eclipse will offer another chance for millions to experience this extraordinary event. While everyone in North America will see a partial eclipse, only those within a specific path will witness totality. This path will traverse parts of Mexico, several U.S. states, and Canadian provinces, providing a unique opportunity for millions to share in this remarkable experience.

As the date approaches, stay updated on the latest eclipse information, including travel and lodging options, to ensure you don't miss out on this once-in-a-lifetime event. With clear skies and open eyes, prepare to witness the magic of a total solar eclipse in 2024.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fd4263183a8b781f7df599/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2000,1125,x0,y223,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 07:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2024/03/24/epa-didnt-ban-gas-cars-it-cut-air-pollution-so-we-can-breathe-easier/,EPA Didn’t Ban Gas Cars. It Cut Air Pollution So We Can Breathe Easier.,"Breathing in polluted air can leave a metallic taste in your mouth and a sting in your nose and lungs. On days when pollution levels are high, known as red air days, it is advised to stay indoors and avoid outdoor activities, especially for vulnerable groups such as the elderly, children, pregnant women, and those with respiratory illnesses.

So, what exactly is the main cause of this toxic air in most places? The answer lies in the internal combustion engines that power our vehicles. Gasoline and diesel engines release harmful pollutants into the air we breathe and contribute to climate change. In fact, transportation has become the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, with light-duty vehicles alone responsible for almost 60% of these emissions.

To address this pervasive air pollution problem, we need to focus on reducing tailpipe pollution from cars. The good news is that we already have a solution: tailpipe emissions standards. These standards require automakers to adopt cleaner technologies, ensuring that new vehicles are cleaner than ever before.

Recently, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) took a significant step by adopting new multi-pollutant rules for light-duty and smaller medium-duty vehicles. These rules limit tailpipe pollution, protecting our air quality and slowing down climate change. By mandating the use of the latest clean technologies, these standards will make a real difference in reducing pollution.

It is essential that everyone has the option to choose a clean car. Electric vehicles (EVs) offer a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional gasoline-powered cars. Americans who are concerned about reducing pollution should have the freedom to drive electric. EVs not only help combat air pollution but also offer a cost-effective solution, saving consumers money in the long run.

However, there are those who oppose these pollution limits. Corporations that profit from selling vehicles and petroleum see these standards as a threat to their interests. They argue that these standards infringe upon American freedoms and consumer choice. But the truth is, these updated pollution limits are long overdue and will benefit all Americans by cleaning the air we breathe and giving consumers the option to break free from the expensive fossil fuel cycle.

For example, the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers launched a campaign across several states and the Beltway, spreading misinformation about the Biden administration's efforts to ban gas, diesel, and flex fuel vehicles. Their aim is to make people believe that the standards are an outright ban on gas cars. However, this claim is false. The EPA's standards are technology-neutral, performance-based, and backed by scientific research.

The Clean Air Act, enacted in 1970, gives the EPA the authority to establish National Ambient Air Quality Standards to protect public health and regulate hazardous air pollutant emissions. The Act also empowers the EPA to regulate vehicle and engine emissions and adapt the standards over time. This has led to significant improvements in air quality over the years.

Before the Clean Air Act, our cities were plagued by severe air pollution. Breathing the air in cities like New York was as harmful as smoking two packs of cigarettes a day. Los Angeles experienced unhealthy levels of air pollution for more than 200 days a year. However, thanks to the Clean Air Act and subsequent regulations, we have made progress in cleaning up our air and protecting public health.

It is crucial that we continue to prioritize clean air and take action to reduce pollution from vehicles. By supporting tailpipe emissions standards and embracing clean technologies like electric vehicles, we can create a healthier and more sustainable future for ourselves and future generations.

Let's celebrate the adoption of these new standards and work towards a cleaner, greener world. Together, we can make a difference and ensure that everyone has access to clean air and the freedom to choose a clean car.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fe401fc35aefb76700b52e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 07:45:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/anuradhavaranasi/2024/03/24/which-adhd-medications-could-lower-risk-of-suicide--hospitalization/,These ADHD Medications Could Lower Risk Of Suicide & Hospitalization,"ADHD Medications Linked to Lower Risk of Suicide and Psychiatric Hospitalizations

A recent study conducted by researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, has found that individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) who were prescribed ADHD stimulant medications had a lower risk of attempting suicide or dying by suicide. The study, which included 221,714 adults and adolescents with ADHD, also revealed that the use of ADHD medications was associated with fewer psychiatric hospitalizations.

The researchers, led by Heidi Taipale, observed a correlation between four specific ADHD medications and a decreased risk of hospitalization due to psychiatric co-morbidities. These medications include amphetamine, lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate. Furthermore, they found that the risk of suicidal behavior was specifically reduced by using lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate.

In a previous study conducted in Sweden in 2019, it was discovered that the prevalence of psychiatric co-morbidity among individuals with ADHD was significantly higher compared to those without ADHD. The study reported a 52% prevalence rate of psychiatric co-morbidity among individuals with ADHD, while the rate among individuals without ADHD was only 7%. Psychiatric co-morbidities include conditions such as major depressive disorder, panic disorder, substance abuse, generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, PTSD, and psychotic symptoms.

The 2019 study also revealed that psychiatric co-morbidity increased the risk of mortality among people with ADHD, especially when the co-morbidity involved substance use disorder. While the study by Taipale and her team did not find a link between the ADHD medication atomoxetine and a lower risk of psychiatric hospitalizations or suicidal behavior, they did find that atomoxetine was associated with fewer hospitalizations for non-psychiatric co-morbidities.

The researchers emphasized the need for more research on the long-term effectiveness and safety of ADHD pharmacotherapies, as there is evidence of both beneficial psychiatric outcomes, such as decreased risk of depression and suicide, and potential adverse outcomes, such as the risk of psychosis.

To conduct their study, the researchers analyzed data from the Swedish National Patient Register and the Prescribed Drug Register. They included individuals between the ages of 16 to 65 years old who had received an ADHD diagnosis between 2006 to 2021. The study participants were tracked for a follow-up period of 15 years.

Out of the 221,714 study participants, 56% had a psychiatric co-morbidity, with anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and stress-related disorders being the most common. Approximately 26% of the participants had been hospitalized due to a psychiatric co-morbidity.

Interestingly, the study found that the effectiveness of certain ADHD medications varied among different age groups and genders. Lisdexamphetamine was associated with a decreased risk of psychiatric hospitalizations among adolescents, young adults, and adults aged 30 and older. However, methylphenidate appeared to be less effective among older adults. Atomoxetine, on the other hand, was linked to a decreased risk of hospitalization among women but not men.

The researchers acknowledged concerns about the potential adverse effects of long-term stimulant use, such as increased blood pressure and heart rate, as well as the risk of cardiovascular diseases, seizures, and possibly psychosis or mania. However, they highlighted the overall beneficial effect of ADHD medications on psychiatric outcomes in their study.

The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the potential benefits of ADHD medications in reducing the risk of suicide and psychiatric hospitalizations among individuals with ADHD. Further research is needed to better understand the long-term effects and safety of these medications.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/63c28dbb82c31b7412c92cf2/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 04:09:46,Innovation,Innovation
