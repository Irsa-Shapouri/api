Here's the good, the bad, and the ugly","DevOps engineering is a highly sought-after profession in today's economy. However, becoming a successful DevOps engineer requires a combination of technical expertise and business acumen. Moreover, staying relevant in this field necessitates a commitment to continuous learning, as popular practices and technologies quickly become outdated.

The demand for DevOps engineers, who are responsible for automating and coordinating the development and deployment of software in both cloud and on-premises environments, is soaring, and the compensation is generous. In the United States, for instance, the average annual salary for a DevOps engineer is estimated to be around $134,000.

But what does it take to excel in this role? Seasoned DevOps engineer Brad Morgan sheds light on the essential skills and knowledge required. At the top of the list is a solid understanding of Linux. Regardless of the specific tasks a DevOps engineer performs, Linux is a fundamental component. It is imperative to possess a strong background in Linux, including a grasp of its basics, familiarity with the terminal, and proficiency in using basic commands.

Additionally, Morgan emphasizes the importance of bash scripting, which automates Linux commands. Bash scripting plays a significant role in the DevOps world, particularly in building pipelines. Hence, it is crucial for DevOps engineers to have a solid understanding of bash scripting.

Cloud skills are also indispensable for a DevOps engineer. Mastering a mainstream cloud provider like AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure can open doors to various job opportunities. Rather than attempting to become proficient in multiple cloud platforms simultaneously, Morgan suggests focusing on mastering one platform at a time. By doing so, it becomes easier to pick up additional platforms later.

Becoming a DevOps engineer does not require following a formal course of study. According to Morgan, the best path to pursue a career in this field is through self-learning. DevOps engineers must have a thirst for knowledge, enjoy continuous learning, and continuously challenge themselves.

This sentiment is echoed by ""Homebrew Henry,"" another experienced DevOps engineer. In a recent YouTube presentation, he emphasizes the need to constantly learn and stay updated with the latest trends in the DevOps ecosystem. Tools and frameworks that were popular yesterday may be replaced by new alternatives. Therefore, DevOps engineers must dedicate their free time to studying and expanding their knowledge.

Even as DevOps engineers gain more experience, learning remains a vital aspect of the job. In fact, many DevOps engineers find the constant learning process to be one of the most enjoyable aspects of their role. With the rapid pace of development and the introduction of AI tools like ChatGPT, DevOps engineering will continue to evolve in the coming years.

One aspect that distinguishes passionate DevOps engineers from their colleagues is their enthusiasm for infrastructure management. Henry warns that if someone is not interested in managing infrastructure, they may struggle in this role. DevOps engineers spend a significant amount of time setting up, configuring, and maintaining the cloud infrastructure that supports various applications. This involves dealing with servers, databases, networks, and security on a daily basis. If someone finds this exciting, then the world of DevOps engineering might be a perfect fit.

On the other hand, if someone's passion lies more in software engineering, writing Terraform code, CI/CD pipelines, and automation scripts may not fully satisfy their coding itch. It may not be the same as building customer-facing applications and may not provide the same level of coding satisfaction. However, it is worth noting that there are numerous examples of individuals transitioning from software engineering to DevOps and vice versa. So, choosing one path does not necessarily mean being locked into it forever.

Another crucial consideration for aspiring DevOps engineers is the business aspect of the role. Unrealistic expectations often surround the DevOps field, with businesses hoping that hiring a few engineers will magically solve all their problems. Therefore, it is essential to manage expectations and communicate the realities of the role to stakeholders and management.

In conclusion, becoming a successful DevOps engineer requires a combination of technical skills, continuous learning, and a passion for both technology and business. It is a field that offers great opportunities and rewards but demands constant adaptation to stay ahead. By mastering essential skills like Linux, bash scripting, and cloud platforms, and by embracing the constant learning process, aspiring DevOps engineers can thrive in this exciting and evolving profession.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/e4d3d8d263eb00323161fcf2566ad35a3fe52282/2024/03/25/1b8b924e-2629-43c2-b416-1b990e262786/gettyimages-1319039490.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/boeing-ceo-to-leave-company-by-year-end-after-a-wave-of-safety-incidents/,Boeing CEO to leave company by year-end after a wave of safety incidents,"Boeing's CEO, Dave Calhoun, is set to step down from his position by the end of 2024, as announced by the company. This decision comes in the wake of a series of safety incidents that have plagued the aircraft manufacturer.

One of the incidents that rocked Boeing was a cabin panel blowout on one of its planes. This, along with several other serious safety issues, has raised concerns about the company's commitment to passenger safety. As a result, Calhoun's departure is seen as a necessary step to restore confidence in the company.

Boeing is known for its innovation acceleration program called Aerospace Xelerated, which was previously known as the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI). This program aims to collaborate with startups in the aerospace industry. It remains unclear how Calhoun's departure will impact this program, and TechCrunch has reached out to Aerospace Xelerated for comment.

In a company statement, Calhoun expressed his intention to focus on stabilizing and positioning the company for the future in the coming months. This indicates that he is committed to ensuring a smooth transition for his successor and addressing the challenges that Boeing currently faces.

The safety incidents that have plagued Boeing have had a significant impact on its reputation. In January, an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 jet was forced into an emergency landing, leading to the grounding of 171 Max 9 jets for several weeks. This incident marked Boeing's biggest safety crisis since the fatal crashes of two Max 8 jets in 2018 and 2019, which claimed the lives of 346 people.

In addition to Calhoun's departure, Stan Deal, who leads Boeing's commercial airplanes business (BCA), will also be leaving the company. Stephanie Pope has been appointed to take over BCA. Pope has been serving as the chief operating officer of Boeing since January of this year. Prior to that, she held the position of president and CEO of Boeing Global Services, where she was responsible for overseeing the company's aerospace services for commercial, government, and aviation industry customers globally.

As this story is still developing, more information is expected to come to light in the future. Boeing's leadership change is a significant development for the company, and it will undoubtedly shape its future trajectory and reputation in the aerospace industry.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1910140688.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-25 12:48:28,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/christianmiller/2024/03/25/getting-more-impatient-when-the-end-is-in-sight-taylor-swifts-new-album-covid-vaccines-and-the-2020-presidential-election/,Getting More Impatient When the End Is in Sight,"Are you eagerly awaiting Taylor Swift's highly anticipated new album, The Tortured Poets Department? As the release date approaches, you might find yourself wondering if your impatience is increasing, decreasing, or staying the same. While all three options are plausible, a recent study conducted by Annabelle Roberts at the University of Texas and Ayelet Fishbach at the University of Chicago suggests that the desire for closure plays a significant role in one's impatience.

In their research, Roberts and Fishbach found that people tend to experience heightened impatience as they near the end of a wait, regardless of the time and energy invested in anticipation. The longing for closure becomes more intense as the moment of fulfillment draws closer. To support their findings, the researchers conducted several studies, including one related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the release of vaccines. Participants were surveyed at different intervals, and their impatience levels were measured in relation to receiving the vaccine and the end of the pandemic.

Interestingly, the results indicated that impatience for the vaccine increased as the announcement drew nearer, while impatience for the pandemic to end remained relatively stable. This led Roberts and Fishbach to conclude that the trajectory of impatience was influenced by proximity to the end rather than the duration of the wait. Similarly, in another study examining the 2020 U.S. presidential election, participants' impatience levels rose as Election Day approached, regardless of their preferred candidate.

Further studies conducted by Roberts and Fishbach explored impatience in various scenarios, such as waiting for a bus, receiving a package, tracking a delivery truck, or enduring a traffic delay. In each case, impatience intensified as the remaining time decreased, emphasizing the significance of the time left rather than the overall waiting period.

These findings have practical implications, suggesting that individuals in positions of authority, such as government officials, nurses, or customer service representatives, should inform people about delays early on and potentially overestimate wait times. Additionally, for those eagerly awaiting a significant event, planning activities or engaging in distractions, such as reading or listening to podcasts, can help manage impatience during the final stretch.

So, for all the Swifties eagerly counting down the days until the release of Taylor Swift's new album (April 19th!), rest assured that your impatience will likely continue to grow until you finally experience the closure you've been longing for.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65f253e5f8f81a9d16371132/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1350,759,x0,y0,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 20:53:11,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.zdnet.com/article/amazon-knows-you-dont-have-the-ai-skills-for-tomorrow-and-has-a-plan-to-help/,"Amazon knows you don't have the AI skills for tomorrow, and has a plan to help","2023 Day of AI at Dearborn STEM Academy (Boston) with Amazon

When we think of Amazon, we often imagine a delivery truck bringing a package to our door. However, Amazon is much more than just a delivery service. It is one of the most innovative companies in the world, with significant investments in infrastructure, supply chain, IT, and transportation.

What many people may not know is that Amazon has been incorporating AI and machine learning into its processes for quite some time, even before the term ""generative AI"" became popular. This makes Amazon a particularly interesting company to discuss when it comes to the future of education and AI.

We had the privilege of speaking with Victor Reinoso, the global director of education philanthropy at Amazon, to delve deeper into this topic. Reinoso brings a wealth of experience to the table, having served as the deputy mayor of Washington D.C. with oversight of the city's education budget.

Reinoso has always been passionate about educating and training students in computer science disciplines to prepare them for the careers of the future. This passion led him to champion initiatives in venture capitalism, consulting, and government roles before joining Amazon in 2020. Now, as the global director of education philanthropy, Reinoso has the opportunity to invest in innovations and nonprofit partnerships that will inspire and better prepare young people for the future.

One of the biggest challenges schools face when it comes to integrating AI education into their curriculums is the lack of resources and know-how. While teachers are eager to deliver AI content to their students, they often struggle to access the necessary tools and training. In fact, a recent survey conducted by Amazon and Access Partnership found that 70% of educators lack the resources to teach AI skills, despite 60% believing that these skills should be taught from Grade 6 through university.

To address this education gap, Reinoso suggests two approaches. Firstly, funding educator training is crucial. Amazon provides professional development opportunities for teachers to implement sustainable STEM education initiatives, increase student awareness of career pathways, and improve job readiness.

Secondly, increasing awareness and access to tools and curriculum is essential. Amazon has made significant efforts in this area, such as their AI Ready commitment, which aims to provide free AI skills training to two million people by 2025. They have also launched initiatives like the Hour of Code Dance Party: AI Edition, a collaboration with Code.org, and the AWS Generative AI Scholarships, which provide scholarships to high school and university students for a generative AI course on Udacity.

Furthermore, Amazon offers eight new and free AI and generative AI courses for professionals in the workplace. These courses cater to individuals of all ages and levels of knowledge, ranging from foundational to advanced.

While integrating AI into education is important, it is equally crucial to teach students how to use AI responsibly. Educators recognize the significance of teaching responsible AI use, with 60% prioritizing it as part of the AI curriculum. As AI continues to evolve, responsible stewards will play a crucial role in guiding its application.

In conclusion, Amazon is not just a delivery service; it is a company at the forefront of AI innovation. With their investments in infrastructure, supply chain, IT, and transportation, they have been incorporating AI and machine learning into their processes for years. Now, they are taking their AI expertise and bringing it to classrooms and virtual learning experiences. Through funding educator training and increasing access to tools and curriculum, Amazon is working to bridge the AI education gap and prepare students for the careers of the future. Furthermore, they recognize the importance of teaching responsible AI use to ensure its ethical and responsible application. With their commitment to education and AI, Amazon is paving the way for a future where AI plays a central role in shaping our society.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/08bc5883c45c188259ecb098a51ea114dc119601/2024/03/25/38b15b64-4b2d-45b8-8147-39fda8737c67/amazon-future-engineer-career-discovery-day-20231024-bsd-students-1010.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 10:59:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/900care-raises-23-million-for-its-waterless-personal-care-products/,900.care sells waterless personal care products and lets you add tap water at home,"The reality of personal care products is that you're essentially purchasing water and plastic. The primary ingredient in shampoo and shower gel is water, which is then mixed with various active ingredients. This means that companies spend a significant amount of money on plastic bottles to transport these products to your bathroom.

However, French startup 900.care is looking to change this. Instead of buying a new bottle of shower gel each time you need it, this startup focuses on the active ingredients. When you place your first order, you receive an empty, reusable plastic bottle with a pump. You then insert a small, compacted powder stick into the bottle, add water, and wait a few hours for it to become ready for use. The next time you need more shower gel or shampoo, all you need is a new stick and some tap water.

Co-founder and CEO Aymeric Grange explains, ""You get all the benefits of using shower gel, such as lather, texture, and fragrance. However, you aren't purchasing any plastic, nor are you carrying unnecessary water.""

900.care has recently secured €21 million ($23 million) in funding, with Lombard Odier Investment Managers leading the round. Existing investors White Star Capital, Swen Blue Ocean, and Founders Future also participated. The startup has experienced success in its home country, generating €10 million ($10.8 million) in revenue in 2023 alone.

In line with the direct-to-consumer model, customers can only purchase 900.care products through its website. Additionally, the company exclusively offers its products through subscriptions. As personal care products are consistently needed, this subscription-based approach ensures a steady revenue stream.

In addition to shampoo and shower gel, 900.care sells foaming hand soap, dish soap, laundry and dishwasher tablets, and other related products. The company estimates that it has prevented the waste equivalent of 3.5 million plastic bottles.

The Perks:
900.care's approach not only benefits the environment but also offers various advantages as a business. Customers receive regular envelopes containing new sticks for their hygiene and home products. These compacted powder sticks are small enough to fit in a standard envelope and be sent via regular mail, saving on shipping fees.

Furthermore, the production process requires smaller factories and production lines. The absence of large basins for mixing water with active ingredients means that different powders can be combined and compacted into tiny sticks instead.

Grange explains, ""During the second quarter of 2023, we opened a factory in Saint-Etienne, dedicated to compacted powder. Initially, we tried working with cosmetic industry experts, but we quickly realized it wasn't feasible. They couldn't keep up with the pace, and their factories weren't designed for it. So we decided to establish our own factory, specifically tailored to our needs.""

This exclusive factory, operated by a partner, has significantly improved 900.care's margins. It has been designed to meet the startup's specifications, ensuring efficient and effective production.

The Future:
900.care has ambitious plans for expansion. Beyond France, Belgium, and Switzerland, the startup aims to enter other European countries. With this expansion, the company expects to reach €100 million in revenue within three years.

Despite its growth plans, 900.care remains focused on profitability. The startup aims to achieve this milestone in the current year, capitalizing on its innovative approach to personal care products.

In conclusion, 900.care is challenging the norms of the personal care industry by offering a sustainable alternative to traditional products. By focusing on the active ingredients and eliminating the need for excessive plastic packaging, the startup not only benefits the environment but also presents a unique business opportunity. With its successful track record and plans for expansion, 900.care is poised to make a significant impact in the European market and beyond.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mousse-Mains-1.jpg?resize=1200,690",2024-03-26 05:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/profluent-spurred-by-salesforce-research-and-backed-by-jeff-dean-uses-ai-to-discover-medicines/,"Profluent, spurred by Salesforce research and backed by Jeff Dean, uses AI to discover medicines","Last year, Salesforce embarked on a project called ProGen, which aimed to utilize generative AI to design proteins. The goal was to develop a more cost-effective method for uncovering medical treatments compared to traditional approaches. While ProGen successfully created the 3D structures of artificial proteins, it didn't make much of an impact commercially. However, one of the researchers involved, Ali Madani, has founded a new company called Profluent, with the aim of bringing protein-generating technology to pharmaceutical companies.

Profluent's mission is to reverse the drug development paradigm by starting with patient and therapeutic needs and working backward to create customized treatments. Madani compares the ""language"" of proteins to natural language like English. He discovered that proteins, which are chains of bonded amino acids used by the body for various purposes, can be treated like words in a paragraph. By inputting protein data into a generative AI model, entirely new proteins with novel functions can be predicted.

Profluent plans to take this concept further by applying it to gene editing. Many genetic diseases cannot be cured by proteins or enzymes derived directly from nature. Additionally, existing gene editing systems have functional tradeoffs that limit their effectiveness. Profluent aims to optimize multiple attributes simultaneously to design custom gene editors that perfectly suit each patient.

Other companies and research groups have already shown the potential of generative AI in predicting proteins. Nvidia released a model called MegaMolBART, trained on a dataset of millions of molecules, to search for potential drug targets and forecast chemical reactions. Meta trained a model called ESM-2 on protein sequences, allowing it to predict sequences for over 600 million proteins in just two weeks. DeepMind's AlphaFold system predicts complete protein structures with unparalleled speed and accuracy.

Profluent is training its AI models on massive datasets, including over 40 billion protein sequences, to create and fine-tune gene editing and protein-producing systems. Rather than developing treatments itself, the company plans to collaborate with external partners to produce ""genetic medicines"" with the most promising paths to approval. This approach could significantly reduce the time and cost typically required for drug development.

According to industry group PhRMA, it takes an average of 10-15 years to develop a new medicine from initial discovery to regulatory approval, with costs ranging from several hundred million to $2.8 billion. Madani believes that Profluent's approach can move the field from accidental discoveries to intentional design of much-needed solutions in biology.

Profluent, based in Berkeley, has received backing from prominent venture capital firms like Spark Capital, Insight Partners, and Air Street Capital. Google Chief Scientist Jeff Dean has also contributed, lending further credibility to the platform. The company's focus in the coming months will be enhancing its AI models by expanding training data sets, as well as acquiring customers and partners. Profluent faces competition from other companies like EvolutionaryScale and Basecamp Research, which are also developing their own protein-generating models with significant VC funding.

With the initial platform developed and scientific breakthroughs in gene editing demonstrated, Profluent is now ready to scale and collaborate with partners to achieve its ambitious goals for the future.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1288172035.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-25 22:08:51,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/bankrupt-ev-startup-arrival-sold-its-assets-to-canoo/,Bankrupt EV startup Arrival sold its assets to Canoo,"Bankrupt electric vehicle (EV) startup Arrival has sold some of its assets, including advanced manufacturing equipment, to struggling startup Canoo. This acquisition is seen as a cost-saving measure that will reduce capital expenditures by 20% for Canoo, which is currently facing challenges in moving beyond prototypes towards commercial production. Canoo plans to send the purchased assets, packed into over 20 container ships, to its facility in Oklahoma. It remains unclear whether Canoo also acquired any of Arrival's intellectual property.

Arrival had previously announced its intention to sell off assets and intellectual property from its U.K. division after filing for bankruptcy protection. The company, once valued at over $13 billion and supported by Hyundai and UPS, had aimed to revolutionize EV production by building compact ""microfactories"" in city centers. However, Arrival's plans, which included electric buses, vans, and a purpose-built car for Uber, fell apart due to financial difficulties and a series of executive departures. The company underwent multiple restructurings, resulting in layoffs, and shifted its focus to the U.S. market to preserve capital. Arrival never succeeded in producing commercial vehicles at scale, and its market valuation has now dropped to around $7.7 million. Following years of volatility and a significant decline in share price, the company ultimately filed for bankruptcy.

Canoo has faced its own challenges since going public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company. The company has struggled to produce its own EV, which features an eye-catching design based on a ""skateboard"" architecture that houses the batteries and electric drivetrain beneath the vehicle's cabin. Although Canoo has reported having more than $1 billion in its sales pipeline, largely due to a deal with Walmart to purchase 4,500 units (with an option for up to 10,000 units), it has faced difficulties in converting these sales into deliveries. Canoo is currently a pre-revenue company, burning through cash and resorting to stock splits and issuing more shares to stay afloat. In fact, the company's stock price languished below $1, triggering a delisting notice and prompting a move to a different tier in the Nasdaq Exchange last year.

Both Arrival and Canoo are striving to navigate the challenging landscape of the EV market. While Arrival's bankruptcy has resulted in the sale of its assets to Canoo, the future of both companies remains uncertain. Canoo's acquisition of Arrival's assets is seen as a strategic move to bolster its own efforts in commercial EV production. However, it remains to be seen whether this acquisition will prove fruitful and help Canoo overcome its own obstacles. As the EV industry continues to evolve and grow, these companies, along with many others, are racing to establish themselves as key players in this promising market.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/canoo-walmart-arkansas.jpg?resize=1200,670",2024-03-25 22:15:20,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/25/google-update-warning-chrome-windows-11-android-iphone/,Google’s New AI Search Goes Horribly Wrong-M Is For Malware,"Be cautious about what you search for because Google's new AI search is causing some unexpected issues. The transition from traditional search to AI search was supposed to be an exciting and improved experience, but the first update has gone horribly wrong.

Google aims to enhance search with generative AI through its Search Generative Experience (SGE). This new technology provides users with a taste of how contextual mechanisms can transform search results. However, an SEO consultant recently discovered scams within the results while experimenting with the new AI-powered search. Bleeping Computer confirmed these findings and warned that users were being redirected to scam sites offering fake iPhone giveaways, unwanted Chrome extensions, browser spam subscriptions, and tech support scams.

The problem with generative AI is that these dangers are disguised in friendly and persuasive language, catching users off guard. Most of the fraudulent redirects were focused on obtaining personal information, generating adware, and promoting unwanted subscriptions for commission payments. Some links were even more malicious, forcing unwanted browser extensions that hijack searches and potentially engage in other harmful behaviors.

Google responded to Bleeping Computer's findings by stating that they continuously update their anti-spam systems to protect SGE users. They confirmed taking action to remove the problematic examples that appeared for uncommon queries. Further comments from Google regarding these issues are still pending. 

Until now, SGE was an opt-in feature, but it is now expanding its reach. According to 9to5Google, Google is showing SGE AI-powered overviews to users who have not signed up. This test is currently being conducted on a small percentage of search traffic and limited to certain categories in the United States. Even users who are not logged into a Google account will be exposed to these AI test results.

It is important to note that the examples provided were from an opt-in Search Labs user, not from the general user population. Hopefully, by the time this feature is widely available, any issues will have been resolved.

Despite these initial challenges, AI search undoubtedly represents the future. However, this serves as a reminder to exercise caution as we explore this new territory. It's crucial to remember that, despite the conversational language used, the same rules for safe searching apply.

As search becomes more integrated into generative AI chatbots, without the ability to view search results, these problems will likely worsen. Therefore, it is essential to improve filters and defenses before this integration happens.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6602155031526c87ed877205/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3115,2027,x1040,y734,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 21:15:00,Innovation,Innovation

March has been a peculiar month, with winter stubbornly holding on and refusing to give way to spring. Although the sun is shining today and the snow is melting, we can expect more snow in the forecast for Easter weekend. And right after Easter comes April Fool's Day, a day I personally dread. It's probably best to stay offline and avoid any pranks.

Interestingly enough, I happened to get one of my two Wordles on April Fool's Day. My guess was ""march"" because if I were playing a Wordle-style prank, I would choose the only other month with five letters that isn't a proper noun. (April is a proper noun, so it can't be a Wordle answer.)

Speaking of yesterday's Wordle, it really threw me for a loop!

Now, let's get down to business and solve today's Wordle.

The hint for today is ""politician,"" and the clue is that the Wordle ends with a consonant.

Spoiler alert! Scroll down for the answer.

Today's Wordle answer is:

Wordle Analysis

After making my third guess, I thought I had it all figured out, only to see the third box turn gray, indicating I was wrong. Oh well, that's life! My initial guess was close but not quite there. I had 196 words remaining and only one yellow ""O."" Thankfully, I received two more yellow boxes, bringing my total to three. With these new letters, I played around and settled on ""major"" because it had the letter ""M"" in it, and I couldn't think of any other words that fit. Unfortunately, it turned out to be ""mayor"" instead of ""major"" for today's Wordle.

Competitive Wordle Score

The Wordle Bot managed to solve this one in just three guesses (crane / tyros / mayor), earning it one point. As for me, I guessed in four, so I don't get any points. My total score for today is -1. Sigh.

The word ""mayor"" originates from the Old French term ""maire,"" which means ""head of a city or town government."" This French word can be traced back to the Latin word ""maior,"" meaning ""greater"" or ""superior."" In Latin, ""maior"" was used in the title ""maior domus,"" which referred to the ""chief steward"" of a noble house. This position held authority and oversight. Over time, ""maior"" evolved into different forms in Romance languages, eventually leading to the English word ""mayor."" The role of a mayor as the leader of a city or municipal government reflects the historical sense of being a superior or chief official within a local jurisdiction.
