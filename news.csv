It Cut Air Pollution So We Can Breathe Easier.,"Air pollution is a widespread problem that affects the health of millions of people. The leading cause of toxic air in many places is the emissions from internal combustion engines fueled by gas or diesel. In the United States, transportation is the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, with light-duty vehicles alone responsible for nearly 60% of the pollution in this sector.

To address this issue, we need to focus on reducing tailpipe pollution from cars. Thankfully, there is a solution: tailpipe emissions standards. These standards require automakers to adopt cleaner technologies, making new vehicles more environmentally friendly than ever before.

Recently, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) made history by implementing new multi-pollutant rules for light-duty and smaller medium-duty vehicles. These rules aim to limit tailpipe pollution, which not only poisons the air we breathe but also contributes to climate change. By adopting these updated standards, automakers are compelled to prioritize clean technologies, ensuring that future vehicles will be cleaner and less harmful to the environment.

It's crucial that everyone has the option to choose a clean car. Electric vehicles (EVs) offer a sustainable alternative to traditional gas-powered cars, and consumers who are concerned about reducing pollution deserve the choice to drive electric. By transitioning to EVs, we can significantly decrease air pollution and have a positive impact on our health and the environment.

However, there are corporations and industries that profit from selling vehicles and petroleum that are resistant to these changes. They claim that the EPA's standards infringe on American freedoms and limit consumer choice. But in reality, these updated pollution limits are long overdue and will benefit all Americans by improving air quality and providing consumers with alternatives to expensive fossil fuels.

For example, the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers launched a campaign aimed at influencing public opinion and spreading misinformation about the EPA's efforts to regulate emissions. They want people to believe that these standards are a ban on gas cars, which is simply not true. The EPA's standards are technology-neutral and based on scientific research and peer-reviewed evidence. They are designed to protect public health and welfare by reducing harmful emissions.

The Clean Air Act, enacted in 1970, empowers the EPA to establish national air quality standards and regulate hazardous air pollutants. The Act also requires the EPA to regulate emissions from vehicles and adapt the standards over time. This legislation has been instrumental in improving air quality in the United States. Before its implementation, cities like New York and Los Angeles suffered from severe air pollution, with smog so thick that it was equivalent to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day.

In conclusion, tackling air pollution requires addressing the root cause of the problem: tailpipe emissions from vehicles. By implementing and enforcing tailpipe emissions standards, we can make significant progress in reducing air pollution and mitigating the effects of climate change. It is essential for individuals to have the option to choose clean cars, such as electric vehicles, to protect our health and the environment. While there may be resistance from corporations and industries, it is important to prioritize the well-being of the public and work towards a cleaner and more sustainable future.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fe401fc35aefb76700b52e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 07:45:00,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.forbes.com/sites/anuradhavaranasi/2024/03/24/which-adhd-medications-could-lower-risk-of-suicide--hospitalization/,These ADHD Medications Could Lower Risk Of Suicide & Hospitalization,"A recent study conducted by researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, has found that individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) who were prescribed ADHD stimulant medications had a lower risk of attempting suicide or dying by suicide. The study, which included over 220,000 adults and adolescents with ADHD, also revealed that the use of ADHD medications was associated with fewer psychiatric hospitalizations.

The researchers, led by Heidi Taipale, analyzed data from the Swedish National Patient Register and the Prescribed Drug Register to track the healthcare and medication usage of study participants. They found that four ADHD medications – amphetamine, lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate – were linked to a decreased risk of hospitalization due to psychiatric co-morbidities. However, only lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate were associated with a decreased risk of suicidal behavior.

A previous study conducted in Sweden in 2019 revealed that individuals with ADHD had a 52% prevalence of psychiatric co-morbidity, compared to only 7% among those without ADHD. Psychiatric co-morbidities include conditions such as major depressive disorder, panic disorder, substance abuse, generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, PTSD, and psychotic symptoms. The 2019 study also found that psychiatric co-morbidity increased the risk of mortality among people with ADHD, particularly in cases of substance use disorder.

While atomoxetine, another ADHD medication, was not linked to a lower risk of psychiatric hospitalizations or suicidal behavior, the researchers did find an association between atomoxetine and fewer hospitalizations for non-psychiatric co-morbidities.

The researchers noted that there is considerable evidence suggesting that ADHD medications, especially stimulants, improve functioning and quality of life in addition to alleviating core ADHD symptoms. However, there is still limited knowledge about the long-term effectiveness and safety of these medications. Long-term observational studies have shown that ADHD medications can have both beneficial psychiatric outcomes, such as decreased risk of depression and suicide, as well as possible adverse outcomes, such as the risk of psychosis. Therefore, the researchers aimed to investigate the association between specific ADHD medication use and the risk of psychiatric hospitalization in a nationwide cohort of adolescents and adults with ADHD.

The study included individuals between the ages of 16 and 65 who had received an ADHD diagnosis between 2006 and 2021 and were residing in Sweden. The researchers analyzed the participants' healthcare data from the Swedish National Patient Register and tracked their ADHD medication usage through the Prescribed Drug Register. Methylphenidate was the most commonly used ADHD medication, followed by lisdexamphetamine and atomoxetine.

During the 15-year follow-up period, 56% of the study participants had a psychiatric co-morbidity, with anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and stress-related disorders being the most common. Approximately 26% of participants had been hospitalized due to a psychiatric co-morbidity.

The study findings revealed that lisdexamphetamine was associated with a decreased risk of psychiatric hospitalizations among adolescents, young adults, and adults aged 30 and older. However, methylphenidate seemed to be less effective among older adults. Atomoxetine was linked to a decreased risk of hospitalization among women but not men.

Overall, the researchers found that ADHD medications had a beneficial effect on psychiatric outcomes, and there was also a decreased risk of non-psychiatric hospitalizations. However, they highlighted concerns about potential adverse outcomes associated with long-term stimulant use, such as increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, seizures, and psychosis or mania.

The study, which was published online on March 20, 2024, in JAMA Network Open, provides valuable insights into the potential benefits of ADHD medications in reducing the risk of psychiatric hospitalizations and suicidal behavior among individuals with ADHD. Further research is needed to better understand the long-term effectiveness and safety of these medications.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/63c28dbb82c31b7412c92cf2/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 04:09:46,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikestubbs/2024/03/24/new-valorant-agent-clove-can-come-back-from-the-dead/,New ‘Valorant’ Agent Clove Can Come Back From The Dead,"Introducing Clove: The New Valorant Agent

Valorant Masters Madrid recently showcased a thrilling surprise for fans of Riot Games' popular first-person shooter game. Meet Clove, the game's 25th agent, who brings a unique set of abilities to the battlefield. With a focus on disruption and utility, Clove also possesses the extraordinary power to come back from the dead. In this blog post, we'll explore the exciting features of this new agent and how they can revolutionize your gameplay.

Clove's arsenal includes four distinct abilities that will undoubtedly leave opponents in awe. Let's start with their E ability, Ruse. Similar to Brimstone's smoke, Ruse allows Clove to create a smokescreen that hinders enemy visibility. What sets Ruse apart is the ability to activate it even after death, granting Clove an advantage that extends beyond the grave. This tactical edge makes Clove an invaluable asset to any team.

Next up is Clove's Q ability, Meddle. This grenade-like throwable inflicts decay upon enemies hit by it. While it may initially seem less impactful than other abilities, Meddle proves to be a game-changer when utilized strategically. Its unique effect can weaken opponents, giving Clove and their allies a significant advantage in crucial moments.

Moving on to Clove's C ability, Pick-Me-Up. Reminiscent of Reyna's kit, this ability allows Clove to absorb the life essence of fallen enemies, granting them haste and a temporary health buff. This regenerative power not only provides Clove with the means to sustain themselves but also enhances their overall performance on the battlefield.

Now, let's delve into the most intriguing aspect of Clove's abilities—their ultimate. When Clove falls in battle, they can quickly activate their ultimate ability to rise from the dead for a limited time. If Clove manages to secure a kill or assist during this resurrection period, they will be fully revived, as if they never perished. However, failing to eliminate an opponent within the timeframe will result in a return to the grave once the resurrection timer expires. This ultimate ability adds a thrilling element of risk and reward to Clove's gameplay, making them an exciting agent to master.

While Clove's abilities offer a range of tactical advantages, it's essential to remember that their effectiveness relies on a fearless and strategic playstyle. Dan Hardison, the agent gameplay designer for Valorant, emphasizes the importance of taking risks and sacrificing oneself for the greater good. Playing as Clove requires a willingness to engage in high-stakes situations, trading your own life for the removal of enemy utility. This unique approach sets Clove apart from other controllers in the game, as their post-death contributions can turn the tide in favor of their team. So, don't be afraid to fight to the death and embrace the risks that come with playing as Clove—a true testament to valor and sacrifice.

In conclusion, Clove brings a fresh and captivating dynamic to the world of Valorant. Their ability to disrupt enemies, provide utility, and resurrect from the dead adds a thrilling twist to the gameplay experience. Whether you're a seasoned player or new to the game, mastering Clove's abilities will undoubtedly elevate your performance and contribute to your team's success. So, gear up, embrace the risks, and let Clove lead you to victory in the ultimate battle for supremacy.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/marshallshepherd/2024/03/24/science-engagement-shapes-lives-and-changes-perceptions-too/,Science Engagement Shapes Lives And Changes Perceptions Too,"Latonia Taliaferro-Smith recently had the opportunity to speak to a group of students at the East Suburban Atlanta Chapter of Jack and Jill of America, Inc. about her career as an atmospheric scientist. Reflecting on her journey as a young Black boy interested in science, she emphasized the importance of scientific engagement in shaping lives and changing perceptions.

Growing up as an only child of a single mother, Taliaferro-Smith developed a curiosity for entomology and stream ecology, which later shifted to a passion for weather after a life-changing bee sting incident. Despite the lack of scientists in her immediate circle, she found inspiration in Dr. George Washington Carver, an agricultural scientist known for his innovative work with peanuts. His influence fueled her desire to understand the intricacies of weather, leading her to pursue a career in meteorology.

While the landscape of STEM careers has evolved over the years, there are still challenges facing Black individuals in these fields. A recent Pew Center study revealed low positive perceptions of Black achievement in STEM, with scientists and engineers ranking among the lowest in professional success. Additionally, the lack of visible examples of Black achievement and perceived barriers in STEM fields contribute to the underrepresentation of Black individuals in these disciplines.

As a seasoned scientist and former president of the American Meteorological Society, Taliaferro-Smith recognizes the importance of fostering a more inclusive STEM ecosystem. She advocates for increasing visibility of diverse achievement, providing mentorship opportunities, challenging cultural perceptions of successful careers, and promoting retention efforts to support the engagement of students and professionals in STEM.

The event with the East Suburban Atlanta Chapter served as a reminder of the impact of mentorship and representation in inspiring the next generation of scientists. Taliaferro-Smith's colleague, Dr. Pearl Dowe, Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs and Asa Griggs Candler Professor of Political Science, also played a key role in empowering students to pursue their passions in STEM. Together, they exemplify the importance of diversity and inclusion in shaping the future of scientific exploration and discovery.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660034c3235190ae18aa9cf0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 11:18:17,Innovation,Innovation

Severino was disqualified for biting Lima in the second round. 

Pressure and the intensity of combat sports can sometimes lead athletes to unexpected actions. A recent incident occurred at UFC Fight Night: Ribas vs. Namajunas, where Igor Severino, in his UFC debut, bit his fellow Brazilian opponent, Andre Lima, during their preliminary bout.

The disqualification of Severino, due to the bite marks clearly visible on Lima, occurred while they were in a standing grappling position. This unfortunate event tarnished Severino's potential to make a mark in the UFC, especially considering his young age of 20.

Severino's first career loss, bringing his record to 9-1, contrasted with Lima's undefeated streak at 8-0. UFC CEO Dana White swiftly made the decision to release Severino from the promotion, emphasizing the gravity of the situation and the missed opportunity for the young fighter.

Biting incidents in combat sports are rare but unforgivable, as seen in this case. Lima's composed reaction to the bite highlighted the severity of Severino's actions. It's evident that Severino will have to rebuild his reputation in smaller promotions before earning another chance in prestigious organizations like the UFC or Professional Fighters League.

As we await more updates from Saturday's events in Las Vegas, it's crucial to remember the sportsmanship and integrity that should always accompany competitive bouts.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff92c285143669667fa59c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3188,1794,x0,y217,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-23 22:45:24,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/apple-sued-microsofts-ai-ambitions-and-nvidia-surprises/,"Apple sued, Microsoft's AI ambitions and Nvidia's surprises","Welcome to the Week in Review! We have some exciting news to share about the latest Apple antitrust lawsuit and Microsoft's AI ambitions. So let's jump right in.

The U.S. has joined international regulators in accusing Apple of using monopolistic tactics to lock in iPhone users. In response, Apple argues that the DOJ's actions could undermine the very things that its users love about its phones and ecosystem.

While the DOJ's lawsuit draws parallels between Apple and Microsoft in the 1990s, there are distinct differences between the two companies and their efforts to retain customers.

However, don't expect any immediate outcomes from the lawsuit. Experts predict that it could take three to five years to reach a resolution.

But that's not all. We have more updates for you, including Reddit's IPO, Nvidia's GTC event, and a surprising change for Glassdoor accounts.

In other news, Microsoft has acquired the co-founders of Inflection AI, a prominent AI startup. Mustafa Suleyman will lead Microsoft AI's consumer-facing unit, while Karén Simonyan will serve as the EVP and CEO of the same group. Inflection AI recently raised $1.3 billion, with Microsoft being the largest investor.

Nvidia made some surprising announcements at its GTC developer conference. CEO Jensen Huang predicted that artificial general intelligence was just five years away. Additionally, Nvidia unveiled GR00T, a new AI platform for humanoid robots.

Google and Apple are reportedly in talks that could result in Google's AI model being used to power upcoming iOS updates. It's unclear if this partnership is temporary until Apple's AI efforts catch up or if it will be a long-term collaboration.

In the realm of hacking and privacy, the Biden administration is forming an international coalition to combat commercial spyware. Interestingly, some investors joining the coalition were previously involved in the spyware business themselves.

There was also a recent hack that disrupted a $5 million Apex Legends tournament. The hacker claimed it was done for fun and to bring attention to the exploit used.

Glassdoor users have reported that their real names are being added to their profiles without consent. The only solution provided to them is to delete their accounts entirely.

Moving on to funding and IPOs, Reddit's IPO had a strong start. The stock opened at $34 a share and jumped 48% on its first day, closing at $46.

Astera Labs, a company that produces connectivity hardware for cloud computing data centers, saw its stock surge 72% on its first day of trading. The AI boom has significantly contributed to its success, with revenue growing by 45% to $115.8 million last year.

The Browser Company, the startup behind the Arc browser, raised $50 million at a $550 million valuation. The company has an ambitious vision to replace PCs with browsers, but its path to monetization remains unclear.

In our bonus round, we explore why AI often struggles with spelling, despite its vast potential. We also discuss Fisker's production pause, which is due to a lack of funds. If the company fails to secure more capital, it may have to cease operations.

Finally, we address the challenge of reviewing AI systems like ChatGPT and Gemini. While these systems cannot be fully reviewed, it is essential to put them to the test.

That wraps up this edition of Week in Review. Stay tuned for more exciting updates in the world of technology and AI.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/apple-antitrust-doj-splash.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-23 20:15:37,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/benjaminwolff/2024/03/24/teaching-machines-to-be-human-and-humans-to-live-with-machines/,"Teaching Machines To Be Human, And Humans To Live With Machines","Robots have long been a source of fear and anxiety, with the idea of machines replacing humans dating back to the Industrial Revolution. However, the recent emergence of robots in our homes, offices, and public spaces raises new questions about how we will interact with them. Will we accept them as partners or keep our distance? What tasks will we allow them to perform? These are the questions that dancer and choreographer Catie Cuan and artist and researcher Ken Goldberg sought to explore in their performance piece ""Breathless: Catie and the Robot.""

Commissioned by Jacob's Pillow and NationalSawdust+ and sponsored by UC Berkeley's AUTOLab, ""Breathless"" pairs Cuan with a UR5e robot arm made by Universal Robots. The piece, which premiered on December 16 at National Sawdust in Brooklyn, New York, is an eight-hour time and motion performance that showcases the dialogue between human and machine.

Cuan, who has a Ph.D. in robotics and AI from Stanford University and a background in professional dance, advocates for a more nuanced approach to integrating robots in the workplace. While robots are predictable and precise, they lack empathy and the ability to perform multiple tasks. Cuan believes that humans possess a range and plasticity that make them irreplaceable.

Goldberg, a professor of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at the University of California Berkeley, is in awe of human dexterity and flexibility, particularly when it comes to grasping objects. His research focuses on understanding and replicating the human hand's ability to sense, touch, and adapt to objects. According to Goldberg, robots are far from achieving this level of sophistication.

The process of creating ""Breathless"" involved months of exploration and collaboration. Cuan and Goldberg began working on the concept in 2021 and enlisted the help of composer Peter van Straten and producer David Imani. Two undergraduate students from Goldberg's lab at Berkeley, Ethan Qiu and Shreya Ganti, joined the team as robot motion engineers.

Rehearsals took place in Berkeley's AUTOLab, where the team worked with the heavy robot arm and blasted music on large speakers to create the right atmosphere. Qiu mapped the desired motions onto the robot joints, while Ganti ensured the software pipeline was fail-safe. The team then conducted multiple dress rehearsals to prepare for the performance.

The intensity of the rehearsals surprised Goldberg and his engineering students. Cuan emphasized the importance of treating the rehearsals as real shows to anticipate any potential issues. She recognized that without proper preparation, a malfunction during a live performance in front of an audience would be disastrous.

Goldberg acknowledges that working on this project has reminded him of the challenges artists face. Despite being dismissive of artists in the past, he now recognizes the creativity and invention required to make artwork.

""Breathless: Catie and the Robot"" is an exploration of the relationship between humans and robots. It challenges the prevailing narrative that robots will replace humans and instead highlights the unique qualities that make humans irreplaceable. Through their performance, Cuan and Goldberg aim to provoke thought and discussion about the integration of robots in our lives.

As robots continue to advance and integrate into various aspects of society, it is crucial to consider the implications and possibilities they bring. The questions raised by ""Breathless"" are ones we must grapple with as we navigate this new era of human-machine interaction.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff3ef2f9d5a71f46aca53b/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 10:36:15,Innovation,Innovation

In this edition, we'll be exploring some exciting fintech startups in Africa, discussing how Copilot benefited from Mint's closure, and diving into the increased support for a particular expense management startup by VCs.

Africa's Fintech Ecosystem Sees Investment Surge
While venture funding has decreased globally, Africa's fintech ecosystem has had a good week. Uber led a $100 million investment in Moove, an African mobility fintech, valuing the startup at $750 million. Additionally, Zone raised $8.5 million to expand its decentralized payment infrastructure. Tanzanian payments company Nala successfully pivoted to offer remittance services, leading them to develop a B2B payment platform.

Opportunity Arises from Mint's Closure
Intuit's decision to shut down budgeting app Mint has created opportunities for startups in the space. Copilot, for example, experienced significant growth in the last four months, resulting in a $6 million Series A funding round led by Nico Wittenborn's Adjacent. Copilot first launched with $250,000 in angel funding and later added support for Apple Card. Monarch Money also benefited from Mint's closure, as previously reported by TechCrunch.

Non-Sexy Industries Attract Investor Attention
Expense management startup Coast targets businesses with field personnel and fleets to manage. Despite being in a non-sexy industry, Coast achieved 550% revenue growth last year and recently secured $25 million in equity funding. Similarly, digital bank Onyx Private, initially focused on high-earning millennials and Gen Zers, has now pivoted to serve B2B customers. After raising $4.1 million last year, Onyx Private informed customers of the termination of its bank operations.

Swiss Fintech nsave Raises $4 Million Seed Funding
Swiss fintech nsave has secured $4 million in seed funding. The company aims to provide accessible banking services in Switzerland to individuals in countries with unstable banking sectors or facing high inflation.

The Untapped Potential of Fintech
Despite the rapid growth of the fintech industry, Ramp's co-founder and CEO, Eric Glyman, believes that the industry has only scratched the surface. He states that his corporate card and expense startup has tapped into just 1% of its potential market share. Both Ramp and Deel celebrated their fifth anniversary this week.
