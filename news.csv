But before we dive into that, let's take a moment to appreciate the current lineup, which offers four diverse games for players to enjoy. Personally, I'm thrilled that my prediction of the kung fu action game, Sifu, came true. Now, let's turn our attention to what April may have in store for us.

PlayStation Plus is Sony's monthly membership program that grants access to online gaming. It's important to note that you don't need a subscription for streaming services like Netflix or free-to-play games such as Warzone or Fortnite. However, if you want to play paid online games, a PS Plus subscription is required. There are three tiers available: Essential, Extra, and Premium. For the purpose of this post, we'll focus on the Essential tier, which costs $79.99/year. The Extra and Premium tiers are priced at $134.99/year and $159.99/year, respectively.

Sony usually reveals the upcoming month's games on the last Wednesday of the current month, though there might be exceptions. As a general rule, the new lineup is released on the first Tuesday of the month, with the games being revealed the previous Wednesday. Therefore, we can expect an announcement for April's lineup on the morning of Wednesday, March 27th, and the new games will become available on Tuesday, April 2nd.

As of now, there haven't been any leaks or rumors regarding the Essential games for April. I've searched high and low for clues, but unfortunately, I haven't uncovered anything substantial. It's highly unlikely that we'll see any new releases on April 2nd. However, I do have a list of predictions, which has been slightly shortened since Sifu has already made its appearance. I must confess that some of these predictions are more wishful thinking than anything else. It's also worth mentioning that we might see a Simulator or sports game in the lineup.

Here are some of my predictions and wishful thinking titles for April's PlayStation Plus lineup:

1. Assassin's Creed Valhalla
2. Need For Speed Unbound
3. The Outer Worlds
4. Forspoken
5. Demon's Souls
6. The Order 1886
7. The Last Of Us Part 1
8. LEGO Jurassic World
9. Marvel's Midnight Suns
10. Tales of Arise
11. Cult Of The Lamb
12. Little Nightmares 2
13. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor
14. Nier: Automata
15. Elden Ring
16. Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice
17. Metal: Hellsinger
18. Donut Country
19. Dead Island 2
20. Metro Exodus
21. Gollum
22. Skull Island: Rise Of Kong
23. The Walking Dead: Destinies

https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/24/new-whatsapp-warning-iphone-15-pro-max-samsung-s24-ultra-upgrade/,New WhatsApp Warning Suddenly Issued For 2 Billion Users,"WhatsApp's biggest upgrade in years has arrived, but there's one setting you should avoid at all costs. It could lead to dangerous consequences. This year, 2024, brings significant changes to the global messaging landscape. From iMessage co-opting RCS to WhatsApp's third-party chat hub, Gemini AI infiltrating Google Messages, and the DOJ lawsuit against Apple with iMessage at the center, these changes all have one thing in commonâ€”a misunderstanding of end-to-end encryption.

End-to-end encryption is a crucial aspect of messaging apps like iMessage, WhatsApp, Signal, and now Google Messages and Facebook Messenger. It ensures the security and privacy of user conversations. WhatsApp even warned that third-party chats are not as secure as chats within the app. The DOJ also emphasized Apple's potential security risks by denying full iMessage security on Android. Despite pressure from governments and security agencies, Facebook Messenger adopted end-to-end encryption by default.

Surprisingly, some media reports are encouraging users to transfer their chats and chat history from WhatsApp to Telegram. WhatsApp allows users to export their chats and select Telegram as the recipient. However, this is alarming because Telegram does not provide end-to-end encryption by default. Its ""secret chat"" option must be manually selected for each one-on-one chat. Kaspersky warned last year that Telegram is not as secure as it claims to be. Moving chats from WhatsApp, which is end-to-end encrypted, to Telegram, which isn't, is a major security risk. This is especially true for group chats that contain sensitive content from multiple users.

Kaspersky emphasized that even WhatsApp, despite being part of Mark Zuckerberg's data-driven empire, uses end-to-end encryption by default. Users do not need to take any additional steps to ensure the security of their messages. The encryption is applied automatically upon installation.

When Telegram first promoted chat migration from WhatsApp, I warned that it was a dangerous move for users, even though it came during a backlash against WhatsApp after Meta's (formerly Facebook) attempt to change user terms and conditions. ESET's Jake Moore advises against moving content out of end-to-end encrypted messaging platforms, as it removes the barriers designed to protect messages. While accessibility is important, it should not come at the cost of security and privacy.

Telegram boasts its cross-platform usability, but this is possible because the content is stored on Telegram's central servers, not through end-to-end encryption. Telegram also promotes reduced smartphone storage by storing everything in the cloud. However, its architecture prioritizes accessibility and simplicity over full encryption. The security of your data depends on policy, not technology.

Therefore, it is strongly advised not to follow the advice of switching from WhatsApp to Telegram. It is a step backward, regardless of what marketing may suggest. Additionally, there are other concerns to consider. Telegram plays opposite roles in the messaging world. On one hand, it aims to be an easy-to-use alternative to WhatsApp, which is why the migration option exists. On the other hand, it has been associated with lack of content controls and has been described as ""social media for organized criminals.""

While Telegram serves various purposes, including for activists and campaigners, its rise in recent years has also brought an increase in criminal activities. It has become a platform for organizing and sharing information, even in geopolitical and human rights contexts. This dark side of Telegram cannot be ignored.

In conclusion, it is important to prioritize security and privacy when choosing a messaging app. While Telegram may offer certain features and conveniences, it lacks the default end-to-end encryption that WhatsApp provides. Stick with WhatsApp for a safer and more secure messaging experience.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65b41420a2b346798e66d370/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2207,1442,x681,y315,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 23:45:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/24/meet-the-apps-that-tell-you-when-to-take-your-eclipse-glasses-off/,Meet The Apps That Tell You When To Take Your Eclipse Glasses Off,"When it comes to knowing when to remove solar eclipse glasses, many people find themselves unsure. A total solar eclipse is a captivating event, but there are a few important factors to consider. First and foremost, you need to be within the path of totality, which is a mere 115 miles wide. Secondly, you must ensure that you are in a location with clear skies. Lastly, you need to know the right time to remove your eclipse glasses in order to witness the sun's majestic corona.

While these requirements may seem daunting, it's important to note that most people do not actually follow them. However, it is the last point that tends to cause panic among those who are eager to experience an eclipse firsthand.

The answer is simple: you remove your eclipse glasses when it gets dark. That's it. If you are within the path of totality, darkness will descend rapidly as the moon's shadow sweeps over you. This moment is impossible to miss. If you are not within the path of totality, it will not become dark, so you should continue to use your glasses.

However, there are now smartphone apps available that provide an immersive audio experience, complete with instructions on when to remove your solar eclipse glasses as totality begins. These apps also guide you through the timing of various phenomena, such as shadow bands (wavy lines on the ground caused by Earth's turbulent atmosphere when the sun is a tiny crescent), Baily's beads (the last few drops of sunlight), and the diamond ring (the final bead before the corona appears like a halo).

Since these apps primarily rely on audio instructions and narration, it is recommended to use them with earphones. Instead of using earbuds that block out the sounds around you, opt for over-the-ear bone conduction earphones for a more inclusive experience.

Let's take a look at some of the available apps:

1. The Eclipse Company (Platforms: iOS and Android; Cost: Pro version costs extra)
The Eclipse Company's app offers real-time weather updates, cloud forecasts for totality, a countdown timer with a vibration alert to safely remove your solar eclipse glasses, and detailed information about local eclipse events. It also alerts users when to look for eclipse phenomena, creating an immersive audio experience. However, it remains silent during totality.

2. Solar Eclipse Timer App (Platforms: iOS and Android; Cost: $1.99 per eclipse)
The Solar Eclipse Timer app uses geolocation to confirm your position within or outside the path of totality. It guides you through the contact times and provides information on eclipse phenomena. Developed by eclipse chaser and educator Gordon Telepun, author of ""Eclipse Day: 2024 and More"" on Apple Books, this app is particularly useful for photographers. It even includes a ""Photographer's Mode"" developed in collaboration with ex-NASA eclipse calculator and photographer Fred Espenak, also known as ""Mr. Eclipse.""

3. One Eclipse (Platforms: iOS only; Cost: $1.99)
Created by the non-profit organizations Astronomers Without Borders and Simulation Curriculum (developers of the SkySafari planetarium app), One Eclipse supports an eclipse glasses recycling program for underserved communities worldwide. In addition to allowing you to simulate the eclipse from your current location or anywhere on Earth, the app features an interactive map with precise eclipse event times and a dynamic Eclipse Countdown clock. It also includes a simple audio timer for all the different phases of the eclipse.

It's important to stay updated with the latest information on total solar eclipses, including travel and lodging options. Be sure to check for new articles each day to ensure you have the most current information.

Wishing you clear skies and unforgettable experiences as you witness the wonder of a total solar eclipse.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65e701ccb41a29b8a2fd120f/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3094,1451,x0,y304,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 19:00:00,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) may seem like different companies at first glance, but they actually share a lot in common. Both companies stumbled upon their core businesses through happy accidents. AWS realized it could sell its internal services to the public, while Nvidia discovered that its gaming GPU was well-suited for processing AI workloads. These accidental discoveries led to explosive revenue growth for both companies.

Nvidia's revenue has been growing at an incredible rate, moving from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024 to $22.1 billion in Q4 2024. However, the majority of this growth comes from the company's data center business. On the other hand, AWS has consistently been a major revenue driver for Amazon. While Microsoft and Google have entered the cloud market, creating competition for AWS, both companies still enjoy a first-mover advantage. As the cloud market continues to grow, it is expected that other chip makers will also gain market share.

Both Nvidia and AWS were in the right place at the right time. The rise of web apps and mobile devices in the early 2010s created a demand for on-demand cloud resources. Enterprises saw the value in moving their workloads to the cloud, rather than maintaining their own data centers. Similarly, the growth of AI and large language models coincided with the increased use of GPUs for processing these workloads.

While AWS has become a highly profitable business, its growth has started to slow down. Nvidia, on the other hand, is experiencing rapid growth. The question is whether Nvidia can sustain this growth and become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS. If the GPU market tightens, Nvidia does have other businesses, but they are smaller and growing at a slower pace than the data center business.

In terms of financial outlook, Nvidia's revenue growth has been astronomical in recent quarters. The company expects to generate $24 billion in revenue in its current quarter, representing a 234% growth compared to the previous year. However, as the company's revenue ramp slows down, its growth rate is expected to decline. Analysts anticipate Nvidia to generate $110.5 billion in revenue in its current fiscal year, an 81% increase from the previous year.

Despite the expected slowdown, Nvidia is still projected to continue scaling its revenue past the $100 billion annual run rate mark. The company controls a significant portion of the market and is poised to benefit from the ongoing growth of AI. While competition from AMD, Intel, and other chipmakers will inevitably increase, Nvidia's strong market position allows it to withstand the competition.

In conclusion, Nvidia and AWS share similar growth trajectories and have become major players in their respective markets. While AWS has already established itself as a highly successful business, Nvidia is experiencing rapid growth and has the potential to become a long-term revenue powerhouse. The future looks promising for both companies, especially as the demand for cloud services and AI continues to rise.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation

Welcome back, Wordle enthusiasts! It's Monday, and we're ready to tackle another challenging puzzle. But before we dive in, let's take a moment to reflect on the weekend. Despite the arrival of spring, many of us were surprised by a sudden snowfall. It may have been unexpected, but there's no denying the beauty of a snowy landscape.

Now, let's get down to business and solve today's Wordle. Here are the hints and clues you've been waiting for:

Hint: We usually think of this as a proper noun.
Clue: Today's Wordle contains a double letter.

Now, let's reveal the answer!

*Drumroll, please*

Today's Wordle phrase is still a mystery. But don't worry, you can play now and try to crack the code yourself!

Wordle Analysis

After each round of Wordle, I always check Wordle Bot to see how well I did. If you're curious about your performance, you can check your Wordles with Wordle Bot too. It's a handy tool!

I have to admit, today's Wordle had me stumped. I started off with a whopping 195 possible solutions, and even after my first guess, ""Boink,"" I was still left with 40 options. It was quite a challenge.

But then, I had a breakthrough. I guessed ""Allay,"" which narrowed down the choices significantly. It revealed that there was more than one 'L' in the phrase, leaving me with just one word left. After some brainstorming, I finally settled on ""Sally."" While I usually think of it as a name, it can also refer to a battle tactic.

Competitive Wordle Score

Unfortunately, today's round was a wash for me. I didn't earn any points for guessing in four attempts or tying with the Bot. It happens sometimes, but that won't stop me from trying again tomorrow!

The Etymology of ""Sally""

In today's Wordle, the word ""sally"" is used in a non-proper noun context. It means to suddenly rush forth or make a sudden attack from a defensive position. It can also refer to setting out on a journey or venture. The etymology of ""sally"" is quite fascinating, tracing its roots through various languages.

The word originated from Middle French, where ""sallie"" was the noun form of ""sallir,"" meaning ""to rush out, leap forth."" ""Sallir"" itself can be traced back to the Latin word ""salire,"" which means ""to leap."" This Latin root has given rise to related words in English, such as ""salient"" (prominently projecting) and ""assail"" (to attack). These words reflect the idea of movement or leaping forth.

In summary, the etymology of ""sally"" reflects the action of moving out or leaping forth, often with a sense of suddenness or unexpectedness. Whether it's a physical attack from a fortified position or embarking on a new journey, ""sally"" captures the essence of taking action.

You'll find daily Wordle and Strands guides, along with a wide range of content on TV shows, streaming guides, movie reviews, video game coverage, and much more.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/non-sexy-industries-can-appeal-to-investors-too/,Non-sexy industries can appeal to investors too,"Welcome to TechCrunch Fintech! In this edition, we will be focusing on the latest developments in the African fintech startup scene, the success of Copilot after Mint's closure, and the increased investment in an expense management startup. To stay updated on the biggest fintech stories, subscribe to our newsletter.

Venture funding in Africa has experienced a decline recently, but there have been some positive highlights this week. Uber led a $100 million investment in Moove, an African mobility fintech startup, pushing its valuation to $750 million. Additionally, Zone raised $8.5 million to expand its decentralized payment infrastructure. Tanzanian payments company Nala successfully pivoted to offer remittance services in 2021 and also developed a B2B payment platform.

The decision by Intuit to shut down budgeting app Mint has created opportunities for other startups in the space. Copilot, for instance, has experienced significant growth in the past four months, leading to a $6 million Series A funding round led by Adjacent. Copilot initially launched with $250,000 in angel funding and later added support for Apple Card. Monarch Money co-founder Ozzie Osman also mentioned that Mint's closure worked in their favor.

Even non-sexy industries can attract investors. Expense management startup Coast targets businesses with real-world field personnel and fleets to manage. It achieved 550% revenue growth last year and recently secured $25 million in equity funding. Onyx Private, a digital bank initially focused on serving high-earning millennials and Gen Zers, has now pivoted to B2B operations. The YC-backed startup raised $4.1 million last year but decided to terminate its bank operations and close customer accounts.

Swiss fintech nsave has raised $4 million in seed funding. The company aims to make banking in Switzerland accessible to individuals in countries with unstable banking sectors or those facing high inflation.

In an interview, Eric Glyman, the co-founder and CEO of Ramp, expressed his belief that the fintech industry is just scratching the surface of its potential. Despite Ramp's growth as a unicorn corporate card and expense startup, Glyman thinks they have only tapped into 1% of their potential market share. Interestingly, both Ramp and Deel celebrated their fifth anniversaries this week.

In a recent antitrust complaint against Apple, the U.S. Justice Department specifically targeted the company's massive financial business.

In other news, Bolt and Checkout.com have partnered to provide frictionless commerce. Rewards startup Fetch raised $50 million in funding from Morgan Stanley. Wealthfront delayed its IPO plans. Keith Rabois, a director at Affirm Holdings, sold shares worth over $318K. Cloud banking tech provider nCino acquired DocFox. Marco secured $12 million to support trade finance in Latin America. PayPal-backed NX Technologies raised $24 million to streamline automotive payments. Prizepool received a cease & desist letter from FDIC for false and misleading statements. DLocal appointed Pedro Arnt as CEO while SebastiÃ¡n Kanovich stepped back. Ryan Zauk has joined OMERS Ventures as a fintech investor. Klarna is taking aim at Visa and Mastercard with an open banking push.
