https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/mallard-bay-airbnb-for-guided-hunting-and-fishing/,Mallard Bay is the Airbnb for guided hunting and fishing,"Americans spent a staggering $144.8 billion on fishing and hunting in 2022, according to a survey conducted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. However, despite the significant investment in these activities, the process of booking guided hunting and fishing trips has remained largely offline. Mallard Bay, a Houston-based startup, aims to change this by providing a user-friendly online marketplace for consumers to find and book guided tours, similar to booking a hotel. Additionally, Mallard Bay offers a vertical SaaS platform for outfitters to manage their back office operations and access additional services like marketing.

Recently, Mallard Bay announced a successful $4.6 million Series A funding round, led by Soul Venture Partners with participation from existing investor Acadian Capital Ventures and other angel investors. The inspiration for Mallard Bay came from co-founder and CEO, Logan Meaux's own disappointing hunting trip experience with his father during his college years. They had booked a three-day guided duck hunt in Oklahoma, only to discover upon arrival that the hunt had been double-booked, leaving them with the option to hunt for just one day alongside 13 other people. Meaux never had the opportunity to fire a single shot.

At that time, Meaux was working for his father's startup, Waitr, which successfully raised $24 million in venture capital before being acquired in 2018. This experience motivated Meaux to launch his own company, and in 2019, he, along with two other co-founders, began working on Mallard Bay. Initially, their plan was to create a marketplace similar to Airbnb for booking guided hunting and fishing trips. However, after gathering feedback from outfitters and guides, they realized that they needed to offer more in order to attract these professionals to their platform. This led them to develop Guidetech, Mallard Bay's back office solution for outfitters.

The response from outfitters was positive, as they recognized the need to modernize their operations. However, many outfitters are primarily passionate about guiding and may lack the business expertise required to transition to an online platform. Mallard Bay's team, who share the same passion for the outdoors and hunting/fishing, brought their domain expertise to the table, offering guidance and support to outfitters during the transition.

Mallard Bay gained traction on their platform when they onboarded Toby Brohlin, a hunting influencer. As more outfitters witnessed his success, they began signing up as well. Brohlin alone has generated over $1 million in gross bookings, and the platform as a whole facilitated more than $6 million in gross bookings in 2023. Mallard Bay is projected to reach $30 million to $35 million in gross bookings in 2024.

Despite the market potential and the company's impressive growth, Meaux admits that securing investors was challenging. Mallard Bay approached over 270 investors before successfully raising their Series A funding. Many investors struggled to understand the hunting and fishing industry and its potential for growth. Additionally, Mallard Bay had to address negative perceptions surrounding hunting and assure potential backers that their platform was not intended for booking exotic hunting trips in Africa. The founders also emphasized to investors that ethical hunting and fishing practices contribute to conservation efforts, an aspect that Mallard Bay is passionate about.

As someone who is not personally involved in hunting or fishing but is intrigued by unique concepts in the startup and tech world, Mallard Bay caught my attention. Hunting SaaS is an interesting and innovative concept, and Mallard Bay is not the only hunting-related company to attract funding recently. HLRBO, an online platform that simplifies the process of finding hunting land leases, secured a $1 million seed round in February.

Furthermore, Mallard Bay's growth since its launch in 2021 is noteworthy. The company's bookings have increased by an impressive 600% year over year, a remarkable achievement considering the perceived niche nature of the hunting and fishing market. This success is a testament to the fact that niche markets are often more significant than they initially appear.

Outdoor activities, including hunting and fishing, account for a substantial portion of the $394 billion spent by people in the U.S. However, many industries within this space still rely heavily on offline methods or outdated technology. Personally, I experienced this recently when attempting to find parking for a hike on Sedona, Arizona's popular Devil's Bridge trail. I had to scour multiple blogs to gather information about parking permits and requirements. This highlights the need for improved technology and online platforms in various outdoor industries, including hunting and fishing.

Mallard Bay's innovative approach, user-friendly platform, and commitment to conservation make it a promising player in the hunting and fishing industry. By bridging the gap between consumers and outfitters, Mallard Bay is revolutionizing the way guided tours are booked and managed, ultimately enhancing the overall experience for outdoor enthusiasts.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/greysen-johnson-cZVzzFadTMc-unsplash.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-23 16:00:34,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have more in common than meets the eye. Both companies experienced significant growth due to the unexpected success of their core businesses. AWS realized it could sell its internal services, such as storage and computing, to other businesses. Similarly, Nvidia discovered that its gaming GPU was well-suited for AI processing. This led to explosive revenue growth for both companies, with Nvidia's revenue increasing from $7.1 billion to $22.1 billion in just a few quarters.

While AWS has consistently been a major revenue driver for Amazon, Nvidia's growth has been even more impressive. However, as the market becomes more competitive and the companies face the law of large numbers, sustaining this growth may become challenging. Nvidia does have other businesses to rely on, but they generate smaller revenues compared to its GPU data center business.

In the short term, Nvidia's financial outlook remains strong. The company expects to generate $24 billion in revenue for the current quarter, representing a 234% increase compared to the previous year. While its growth rate is expected to decline, Nvidia is still projected to generate $110.5 billion in revenue for the fiscal year, an 81% increase from the previous year.

Despite the potential challenges, Nvidia has momentum on its side. The demand for AI continues to grow, and Nvidia has a significant market share in the chip industry. While competition from AMD, Intel, and other chipmakers may increase, Nvidia's current dominance allows it to withstand the competition. IDC data shows that Nvidia is firmly in control at the chip level, and although AMD is gaining ground at the board level, Nvidia still maintains a strong position.

In conclusion, Nvidia's success story resembles that of AWS. Both companies found success through their core businesses and experienced rapid revenue growth. While challenges lie ahead, particularly with increased competition, Nvidia's strong market position and the continued demand for AI suggest that its growth trajectory will continue for the foreseeable future.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/25/438-places-in-the-us-to-get-free-solar-eclipse-glasses---from-today/,438 Places In The U.S. To Get Free Solar Eclipse Glasses -From Today,"Eye care company MyEyeDr. is giving away more than 90,000 free solar eclipse glasses ahead of the total solar eclipse on April 8. This giveaway, in partnership with volunteer charity Prevent Blindness, will take place from March 25 to April 8 at over 400 locations in 20 U.S. states.

To make the offer even more accessible, MyEyeDr. has expanded the giveaway to all customers and community members, regardless of whether they make a purchase. Starting March 25, people can visit their local MyEyeDr. office to receive a free pair of solar eclipse glasses, while supplies last.

The participating locations are spread across 12 of the 15 U.S. states that will be touched by the path of totality. These states include Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, and Vermont. Additionally, there are participating locations in Alabama, Connecticut, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Virginia, Wisconsin, and West Virginia.

It's worth noting that on April 8, everyone in North America will be able to witness a partial eclipse of the sun. However, it is crucial to take safety precautions when viewing the eclipse. MyEyeDr. has provided some safety tips, including never looking directly at the sun and inspecting solar filters or eclipse glasses for any damage or scratches before using them. It is also important to fully cover your eyes with the glasses or solar viewer before looking up and to avoid purchasing eclipse glasses from unreliable sources online. Even the darkest sunglasses cannot provide complete protection from the sun's harmful rays during an eclipse.

For those who do not have access to solar eclipse glasses, there are alternative methods to safely enjoy the eclipse, such as constructing an eclipse-viewing box or pinhole camera. It is also essential to know when it is safe to remove your eclipse glasses during totality if you are in the path of totality.

According to Artis Beatty, Chief Medical Officer at MyEyeDr., this giveaway is an excellent opportunity to raise awareness about the importance of eye health during this significant event. MyEyeDr. hopes to make the eclipse-viewing experience safe and enjoyable for everyone.

For more information about the total solar eclipse, including travel and lodging options, stay tuned to MyEyeDr.'s daily updates. They wish everyone clear skies and wide eyes for this historical and exciting event.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fdd05898ad68c3e44e9f13/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2950,1659,x103,y0,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 05:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/24/new-whatsapp-warning-iphone-15-pro-max-samsung-s24-ultra-upgrade/,New WhatsApp Warning Suddenly Issued For 2 Billion Users,"WhatsApp's latest upgrade brings significant changes to the messaging landscape. However, there is one setting within the app that users should avoid due to potential dangers. This year, 2024, has seen various changes in the messaging world, including iMessage adopting RCS, WhatsApp's third-party chat hub, Gemini AI integrating with Google Messages, and the DOJ lawsuit against Apple with iMessage at the center. These changes often stem from a misunderstanding of end-to-end encryption, which messaging platforms like iMessage, WhatsApp, and Signal have used for years. Google Messages and Facebook Messenger have also made it their default encryption method.

End-to-end encryption is so crucial that WhatsApp has warned users that third-party chats are not as secure as WhatsApp-to-WhatsApp chats. The DOJ has also emphasized that Apple's denial of full iMessage security on Android makes iPhone users less secure. Despite pressure from governments and security agencies, Facebook Messenger has adopted end-to-end encryption by default. Therefore, it is surprising to see media reports encouraging users to transfer their chats and chat history from WhatsApp to Telegram. While WhatsApp allows users to export their chats and select Telegram as the recipient, this move is alarming due to Telegram's lack of default end-to-end encryption.

Telegram, unlike other messaging platforms, does not provide end-to-end encryption by default. Its ""secret chat"" option needs to be manually selected for each individual chat. Kaspersky warned last year that Telegram is not as secure as its developers claim. By default, Telegram chats do not use end-to-end encryption, and the messenger does not inform users about the secure chat option. Therefore, moving chats from WhatsApp, which is encrypted by default, to Telegram, which is not, poses a significant security risk. This is especially true for group chats that contain otherwise secure content from multiple users.

WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption is automatically enabled, requiring no additional steps from the user. Messages are protected right out of the box, even from service owners. When Telegram first promoted chat migration from WhatsApp, it was a dangerous move for users, despite the backlash against WhatsApp at the time. As ESET's Jake Moore advises, pulling content out of end-to-end encrypted messaging platforms removes the barriers designed to protect messages. While accessibility is important, it should not come at the expense of security and privacy. Telegram's ease of use across platforms relies on its central servers, which would not be possible with end-to-end encryption.

Telegram also boasts reduced smartphone storage by storing everything in its cloud. However, its architecture prioritizes accessibility and simplicity over full encryption. The security of user data depends on policy rather than technology. Therefore, it is strongly recommended not to follow advice to switch from WhatsApp to Telegram. This would be a backward step, regardless of marketing claims. Additionally, there are other issues to consider with Telegram.

Telegram has a dual role in the messaging world. On one hand, it aims to be an easy-to-use alternative to WhatsApp with various features, hence the option for chat migration. On the other hand, it has gained a reputation as the ""wild west"" of messaging, particularly with its connections to Russia. Recently, Spain's High Court suspended Telegram due to a lack of content controls. The Financial Times has also highlighted Telegram's similarities to the dark web, with some describing it as ""social media for organized criminals."" However, it is not just criminals who use Telegram; it is also popular among campaigners and activists. The platform has experienced a rapid rise from a niche messaging app to an essential news source and organizing tool, even in geopolitical and human rights contexts.

In conclusion, it is advised not to switch from WhatsApp to Telegram due to the latter's lack of default end-to-end encryption. While Telegram may offer certain features and ease of use, its security and privacy measures are not on par with WhatsApp. Additionally, Telegram has faced issues with content controls and has gained a reputation as a platform used by criminals. Therefore, it is safer to stick with WhatsApp and its default end-to-end encryption for secure messaging.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65b41420a2b346798e66d370/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2207,1442,x681,y315,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 23:45:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/why-its-impossible-to-review-ais-and-why-techcrunch-is-doing-it-anyway/,"Why it's impossible to review AIs, and why TechCrunch is doing it anyway","Every week, it seems like there's a new AI model being released. The technology has advanced so rapidly that it's nearly impossible to comprehensively evaluate these models. However, it's still important to try, and that's exactly what we aim to do.

The problem with evaluating AI models like ChatGPT or Gemini is that they are too general and are constantly being updated. This means that evaluation frameworks quickly become outdated, and synthetic benchmarks only provide a limited view of their capabilities. Companies like Google and OpenAI take advantage of this by making claims about their models without providing any external sources of truth. That's why it's crucial to provide qualitative analysis as a counterweight to industry hype.

The sheer number and variety of AI models make it nearly impossible for anyone but a dedicated organization to assess their merits and shortcomings. At TechCrunch, we receive news of new models or updates on a daily basis. While we take note of their characteristics, there's only so much information we can handle. The complexity of the AI landscape, with its different platforms, code bases, and access requirements, makes it feel like an impossible task.

Fortunately, our readers are more interested in top-line models and major releases. While research models like Vicuna-13B may be fascinating to researchers and developers, they are not widely used for everyday purposes like ChatGPT or Gemini. Therefore, we can exclude these research models from our evaluation. However, even after excluding a large number of models, we are still left with more than we can handle.

The reason for this overwhelming number of models is that they are not just simple pieces of software or hardware. They are complex platforms with numerous individual models and services embedded within them. For example, when you ask Gemini for a recommendation for a good Thai restaurant, it doesn't just search its training set for the answer. Instead, it queries various Google services and sub-models to provide a response. These AI systems are constantly evolving and integrating new services, making it difficult to evaluate them.

Moreover, these AI systems can be used for a wide range of tasks, even ones that their creators didn't anticipate. This makes it impossible to exhaustively test their capabilities. Even with millions of people using these systems every day, we still can't fully explore what they can or can't do. Developers are constantly discovering new functions and unexpected edge cases.

Adding to the challenge is the fact that companies like OpenAI and Google keep their training methods and databases as trade secrets. While transparency and open inspection are crucial for mission-critical processes, these companies prefer to keep their methods hidden. For example, we still don't know if OpenAI used pirated books to train ChatGPT. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to fully understand the inner workings of these AI models.

But that doesn't mean AI models can't be evaluated at all. It's just not a straightforward process. Imagine an AI model as a baseball player. They may have multiple talents like cooking, singing, or coding, but what really matters is their ability to hit, field, and run. Similarly, AI models can do many things, but only a few of those things are crucial and widely used by millions of people. It's these key capabilities that we focus on evaluating.

In conclusion, evaluating AI models like ChatGPT or Gemini is a challenging task due to their rapid updates, complexity, and lack of transparency. However, it's important to provide qualitative analysis as a counterbalance to industry hype. While evaluating these models is not straightforward, we can still assess their key capabilities and provide valuable insights to our readers.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ai-robot-phrenology-v4.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-23 13:01:15,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2024/03/24/the-walking-dead-the-ones-who-live-episode-5-review---another-massively-disappointing-episode/,‘The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live’ Episode 5 Review - Another Massively Disappointing Episode,"The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live has been a rollercoaster of emotions throughout its first five episodes. As a dedicated viewer, I must say that I have had my fair share of ups and downs with the show. While some episodes have left me thoroughly disappointed, others have managed to capture my attention and keep me engaged. With such a short season, each episode holds immense weight and has the power to make or break the overall experience.

Unfortunately, the second-to-last episode of the season, titled ""Become,"" fell short of my expectations. Although it was an improvement from the previous episode, it still had its fair share of flaws. The abundance of ridiculous coincidences and repetitive plot points left me feeling cold and unimpressed. I had hoped for the show to redeem itself this week, but instead, it relied on conveniently constructed storylines that lacked depth and creativity.

One surprising element of this episode was the unexpected appearance of Gabriel, portrayed by Seth Gilliam. I was taken aback by this cameo, as many had anticipated the return of Morgan, played by Lennie James. Morgan's character had been mishandled in Fear The Walking Dead, and I, like many others, had grown tired of his presence. The talented actor deserved better than the lackluster material he was given. It is a shame that even on the main show, Morgan's character development was inconsistent, with random moments of insanity and meaningless catchphrases. It is a wasted opportunity that could have been avoided.

Despite its flaws, ""Become"" did have its moments. The flashback scenes featuring Gabriel and Jadis, portrayed by Pollyanna McIntosh, were suspenseful and engaging. The revelation of Jadis killing a confidante added intrigue to the storyline, making me fear for Gabriel's life. However, I must admit that having Jadis kill him would have been a bold move for the series, as it would have added an unexpected twist. Unfortunately, the show chose the safer route and had Jadis meet her demise instead, delivering a cheesy monologue about her transformation, which conveniently tied into the episode's title.

One aspect of the episode that did not sit well with me was its lack of plausibility. Rick and Michonne, played by Andrew Lincoln and Danai Gurira respectively, found themselves on the run, presumed dead by others. They stumbled upon a trio of survivors being attacked by what I can only describe as ""stoners,"" zombies whose bodies had calcified into stone. Initially, these creatures appeared invincible due to their rock-hard skin, but our heroes effortlessly dispatched them. The encounter took an unexpected turn when the survivors turned on Rick and Michonne, holding them at gunpoint. However, instead of a tense standoff, our heroes quickly overpowered their assailants, even returning their weapons as a sign of goodwill. This turn of events left me perplexed. While I understand the desire to avoid unnecessary bloodshed, giving weapons back to individuals who had just threatened their lives seemed illogical and naïve.

This encounter with the trio of survivors raises an ongoing question that I have had throughout the series: how do these seemingly incompetent individuals manage to survive in a world overrun by zombies for over a decade? Basic survival skills should be a given at this point, yet the show continues to introduce characters who lack the necessary wit and capability. It is baffling to me that anyone who has managed to stay alive this long would not possess the skills and resourcefulness of characters like Rick and Michonne. It's almost as if the show expects us to suspend our disbelief and accept that stupidity and incompetence can coexist with survival in this post-apocalyptic world.

On a lighter note, Rick and Michonne's romantic relationship has taken center stage in recent episodes. Their chemistry and affection for one another are evident, as they seize every opportunity to express their love. It is endearing to see their relationship evolve, especially considering the minimal romantic moments they shared in the earlier seasons. However, I must admit that their constant displays of affection have become somewhat comical. I half-expected them to start kissing in the midst of the fight with the trio of survivors. Their love for each other is admirable, but it should not overshadow the gravity of the situations they find themselves in.

Despite the challenges they face, Rick and Michonne have managed to find moments of respite. Last week, they stumbled upon a fully-powered smart home, which provided them with a safe haven amidst chaos. It was a stroke of luck that they chose to engage in a passionate encounter while the building was literally collapsing around them. This week, they found solace in the Three Pines Cabin, a cozy retreat where they could momentarily escape the horrors of their reality. The atmosphere was serene, with candles and alcohol setting the mood for a peaceful evening.

However, as is often the case in this world, peace is short-lived. The next morning, Jadis reappeared, guns drawn, ready for a confrontation. The episode ends on a cliffhanger, leaving us eagerly anticipating the season finale and the resolution of this tense encounter.

In conclusion, ""Become"" had its fair share of flaws and implausible moments. The episode failed to live up to its potential, relying on convenient plot points rather than exploring new and exciting storylines. However, it did manage to capture our attention with suspenseful flashback scenes and the unexpected return of Gabriel. Despite the setbacks, we remain hopeful that the season finale will redeem the show and provide a satisfying conclusion to this rollercoaster of a season.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600b341eca045b614f49ec5/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=800,450,x0,y41,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 21:39:14,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/24/meet-the-apps-that-tell-you-when-to-take-your-eclipse-glasses-off/,Meet The Apps That Tell You When To Take Your Eclipse Glasses Off,"When it comes to the question of when to remove solar eclipse glasses, many people find themselves perplexed. Attending a total solar eclipse can be an incredibly dynamic experience, with several factors to consider. First, you must position yourself within the narrow path of totality, which is just 115 miles wide. Secondly, you need to ensure that you are in a location with a clear sky. And finally, you must remove your eclipse glasses at precisely the right moment to witness the sun's magnificent corona.

While most individuals do not partake in these steps, it is the final one that tends to cause panic among potential eclipse enthusiasts. However, the answer is quite simple: remove your eclipse glasses when it becomes dark. If you are fortunate enough to be in the path of totality, you will witness a rapid darkening as the moon's shadow engulfs you. It will be an unmistakable moment, and you won't miss it. However, if you are not in the path of totality, it will not become dark, and you should continue using your glasses.

Now, there are smartphone apps available that provide an immersive audio experience, guiding users on when to remove their solar eclipse glasses as totality begins. These apps also offer instructions on when to observe specific phenomena, such as shadow bands (wavy lines on the ground caused by Earth's turbulent atmosphere when the sun appears as a tiny crescent), Baily's beads (the last remnants of sunlight), and the diamond ring (the final bead resembling a jewel as the corona emerges like a halo).

Since these apps primarily rely on audio instructions and narration, it is advisable to use them with earphones. However, instead of using earbuds that block out your surroundings, opt for over-the-ear models like bone conduction earphones.

Here are a few notable apps for experiencing a solar eclipse:

1. The Eclipse Company:
Available on iOS and Android platforms, this app offers a ""Pro"" version that provides real-time weather updates, cloud forecasts for totality, a countdown timer with a vibration alert to safely remove solar eclipse glasses, and detailed information about local eclipse events. It also alerts users about when to look for eclipse phenomena, offering an immersive audio experience. However, it remains silent during totality. Please note that the Pro version may incur additional costs.

2. Solar Eclipse Timer App:
Compatible with iOS and Android, this app determines your location and confirms whether you are within or outside the path of totality. It guides you through the contact times and provides information on eclipse phenomena. Developed by Gordon Telepun, an avid eclipse chaser and educator, and author of ""Eclipse Day: 2024 and More"" on Apple Books, this app is particularly useful for photographers. It even features a new ""Photographer's Mode,"" developed in collaboration with ex-NASA eclipse calculator and photographer Fred Espenak, also known as ""Mr. Eclipse."" The app is available for a price of $1.99 per eclipse.

3. One Eclipse:
This app is exclusive to iOS and is not available on Android. Created by the non-profit organizations Astronomers Without Borders and Simulation Curriculum, makers of the SkySafari planetarium app, One Eclipse supports a recycling program for eclipse glasses in underserved communities worldwide. In addition to simulating the eclipse from your location or any point on Earth, the app includes an interactive map with precise eclipse event times and a dynamic Eclipse Countdown clock. It even offers a simple audio timer for each phase of the eclipse. The cost of the app is $1.99.

https://venturebeat.com/ai/companies-are-about-to-waste-billions-on-ai-heres-how-not-to-become-one-of-them/,Companies are about to waste billions on AI - here's how not to become one of them,"Join us in Boston on March 27 for an exclusive networking event focused on data integrity. The Gen AI enterprise leaders event will provide insights and conversations surrounding this important topic. Request an invite here.

In the world of venture capital (VC), it's all about investing money, not seeking adventure. This was a response from a VC to a friend who was pitching an idea. However, when it comes to new technologies, caution often goes out the window during the hype cycle phase. VCs need to deploy their capital and the fear of missing out on something big outweighs the downside of taking risks, especially when everyone else is doing the same.

This dynamic also plays out within companies, particularly when it comes to AI and anything even remotely associated with it. Large language models (LLMs) are considered AI, and machine learning (ML) falls under that umbrella as well. So, if you have a project that has been repeatedly denied funding, try labeling it as AI and give it another shot.

However, we need to be aware that billions of dollars will be wasted on AI over the next decade. This may sound contradictory, but it's not. Every major technology wave comes with excitement before we truly understand its real transformative potential. Search, social media, and mobile have all had a lasting impact, but virtual reality (VR) and cryptocurrency have been more limited in their reach.

Despite the hype, LLMs are undeniably a game-changing technology. Just look at how quickly ChatGPT reached 100 million users compared to other transformative companies. Almost every enterprise company is exploring ways to leverage LLMs and AI. The question is, how do you decide where to invest and where you have a chance to succeed?

To avoid wasting resources, focus on these three key factors:

1. Understand the total cost over time: Before saying yes to an AI project, consider the cost of the necessary resources, both upfront and ongoing, to sustain the project. Often, the work of a data science team requires extensive engineering, DevOps, QA, product, and SysOps support. Many companies have abandoned projects that were once promising ideas but lacked the necessary investment to keep them going. Saying no to an AI initiative can be difficult in the present, but saying yes too frequently can jeopardize funding for more worthwhile projects in the future. Additionally, be aware of the increasing marginal cost associated with AI. Training, running, and maintaining large models can be expensive. Overusing AI without a corresponding increase in value can eat into your margins. And if you have to pull back functionality that was promised or released, it can lead to customer dissatisfaction and damage your reputation.

2. Ask why no one else can do it: While we learn about commoditization from textbooks, the real-life experience of facing it is more impactful. Consider the tech industry, where there are monopolies and commodities. When considering an AI initiative, ask yourself why your company is the right choice. Working on something that will eventually become a commodity is not enjoyable, especially if you lack the scale or cost advantage. The only ones who will truly benefit in such cases are companies like Nvidia and AWS/Azure. To overcome this, focus on areas where you have a defensive moat. This could be preferential access to data, proprietary insights about a specific use case, or an application with strong network effects where you have a head start.

3. Make strategic bets: Sometimes, the best bets are the ones that enhance your existing business. As the old BASF commercial says, ""We don't make the things you buy, we make the things you buy better."" If applying AI can provide momentum to your current products or services, it's a worthwhile investment.

In conclusion, while there may be a lot of hype around AI, it's important to approach it strategically. Understand the costs involved, consider why your company is uniquely positioned to succeed, and make strategic bets that align with your core business. By doing so, you'll be able to avoid wasting resources and maximize the potential of AI in your organization.",https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/An_AI_sitting_in_a_corner_curled_up_looking_sa-transformed.jpeg?w=1200&strip=all,2024-03-24 18:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/25/google-upgrade-samsung-s24-s23-pixel-towards-apple-iphone-15-pro-max/,Google Suddenly Reveals Surprise Android Update That Beats iPhone,"Android and iPhone have become increasingly similar in terms of features and capabilities. However, Google has recently introduced a groundbreaking update that puts Android ahead of Apple in one particular area. This update, which is currently in the works, has the potential to revolutionize the way users experience their smartphones.

Google's primary objective with this update is to make Android more like iPhone, as the two leading smartphone ecosystems compete for users. In recent months, Google has made notable advancements in Android security, integrated WhatsApp calls into its phone dialer, and even added Apple passes to its wallet. Now, with its latest update, Google not only matches an existing feature on the iPhone but surpasses it.

Previously, I reported on Google's efforts to incorporate an emergency satellite service into Android, effectively catching up to the satellite SOS functionality that Apple has offered for a few years. However, Google's offering takes it a step further by including a ready-made Garmin rescue service. This significant development enhances the safety and security of Android users on a large scale.

One limitation of Apple's emergency SOS feature is that it is only intended for emergencies. This means that for those who are not engaged in extreme activities like mountain climbing or sailing, the feature remains unused. However, with the latest Android 15 developer preview, Google is bridging this gap and enabling users to expand their cellular accounts to include a satellite add-on. This allows core messaging apps to utilize the satellite network and eliminates the issue of cellular black-spots that leave users without connectivity.

According to Mishaal Rahman, Android 15 DP2 introduces certain user interface elements to ensure a consistent experience for devices that support satellite connectivity. The update also expands platform support for satellite connectivity by introducing a new API that allows apps to detect when a device is connected to a satellite. Additionally, Android 15 enables SMS/MMS/RCS apps to utilize satellite connectivity for sending and receiving messages.

The real news lies in the fact that messaging apps can now utilize satellite connectivity. Some networks already have plans to offer low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite connectivity as an account option. This is a significant improvement from our initial understanding of Google's plans, when Pixel phones were prematurely updated with a ""Satellite SOS"" feature. This feature was placed between Car Crash Detection and Emergency SOS.

In comparison, Apple's satellite connectivity remains more limited. According to Apple, users of iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15, or iPhone 15 Pro can connect their devices to a satellite to text emergency services, request roadside assistance, and share their location with friends and family when they have no mobile or Wi-Fi coverage.

There were hopes that Android would go even further, with previous beta code suggesting a satellite messaging option in partnership with T-Mobile. The potential for this technology to transform communication became apparent when SpaceX achieved download speeds of 17mbps to an unmodified Galaxy S21 Ultra. This means that smartphones could make calls and send messages directly through a satellite, even in areas with no conventional cellular network coverage. Starlink has been testing such a service, and it is expected to be available in the near future.

While direct satellite connectivity for phones may become more common and usable in the future, the integration of messaging services is a great starting point. The inclusion of this feature in Android 15 seems to be confirmed, pending any major changes. As Android and iPhone continue to converge, this development demonstrates Google's leadership in the industry, with Apple likely to follow suit. This news comes shortly after reports that Gemini, a popular cryptocurrency exchange, may be coming to the iPhone, and Apple's claim that a lawsuit filed against it by the Department of Justice would essentially turn the iPhone into an Android device.

Update 3/23: Exciting new details about Google's satellite messaging plans have emerged shortly after reports that Gemini might be integrated into Apple's iPhone to power AI updates in iOS 18. This development is intriguing for several reasons. Not only does it bring Android and iPhone closer together, but it also strengthens Google's presence within the iPhone ecosystem.

In terms of the Android versus iPhone competition, this is a noteworthy development. Android is moving at a faster pace than iPhone, particularly with the deployment of Gemini on Android devices. While Apple users eagerly await information about the upcoming OS changes in the fall,",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65d79ec3dadcd6b682668331/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 00:06:15,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/anuradhavaranasi/2024/03/25/the-countries-most-and-least-accepting-of-autistic-individuals/,The Countries Least Accepting Of Autistic Individuals,"A recent survey conducted in eight countries revealed that autistic individuals in Japan and Belgium face the lowest levels of societal acceptance. The study involved 306 participants from the USA, UK, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, and Belgium. Although autistic individuals in Canada, the UK, and South Africa reported slightly higher levels of acceptance, only 23.5% of the participants across all countries felt accepted by society as autistic individuals.

The researchers defined autism acceptance as the feeling of being accepted and appreciated as an autistic person, with autism being recognized and accepted in a positive manner by both oneself and others. They emphasized that throughout their lives, autistic individuals face a higher risk of psychiatric and mental health disorders, and their life expectancy is nearly two decades shorter than that of their non-autistic peers. Depression and anxiety are the most common psychiatric co-morbidities among autistic adults, with prevalence rates reaching as high as 47% and 54%, respectively.

The researchers identified several factors that contribute to the increased mental health difficulties experienced by autistic individuals. For instance, the prevalence of alexithymia, a subclinical condition characterized by difficulties in identifying, expressing, and differentiating emotions, is significantly higher in autistic individuals (49.93%) compared to the non-autistic population (4.89%). Additionally, the researchers highlighted the impact of ""minority stressors"" on autistic individuals, including everyday discrimination and internalized stigma due to their marginalized minority status.

The study also shed light on the phenomenon of autistic individuals camouflaging their traits in order to avoid rejection and discrimination. Camouflaging refers to the strategies employed by autistic individuals to minimize the visibility of their autism in social situations. These strategies may include learning to use eye contact, developing scripts to navigate social interactions, and suppressing stimming behaviors, which are repetitive movements used by autistic individuals to self-regulate their emotions and bodies in overwhelming environments.

While camouflaging is common among autistic individuals, it is particularly prevalent among autistic women and those with higher levels of autistic traits. The researchers pointed out that camouflaging may be a risk factor for depression and anxiety in autism, regardless of gender. Autistic individuals who experience more social stressors, such as a lack of autism acceptance, are more likely to camouflage their autistic traits, resulting in higher levels of anxiety and depression.

Lead author Connor Keating of the University of Birmingham's School of Psychology emphasized the need to combat the stigma surrounding autism and reduce the pressure on autistic individuals to conceal their identity. The study was published in PLoS One on March 20, 2024.

In conclusion, this survey highlights the significant lack of societal acceptance faced by autistic individuals, particularly in Japan and Belgium. It emphasizes the detrimental impact of this lack of acceptance on the mental health and well-being of autistic individuals. The study calls for greater awareness, understanding, and support for autistic individuals to combat stigma and promote acceptance in society.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66011516945f390030af66b1/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 03:06:35,Innovation,Innovation
