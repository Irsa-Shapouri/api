https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikestubbs/2024/03/24/new-valorant-agent-clove-can-come-back-from-the-dead/,New ‘Valorant’ Agent Clove Can Come Back From The Dead,"Valorant recently introduced its 25th agent, Clove, at the Valorant Masters Madrid tournament. With unique abilities that set them apart, Clove promises to be a game-changer in the arena. As a controller, Clove focuses on disrupting enemies and providing utility for their team. However, what makes Clove truly intriguing is their ability to come back from the dead, making them a lethal force to be reckoned with. Let's delve into Clove's abilities and see how they can turn the tides of battle.

Clove's first ability is called Ruse, activated with the E key. It functions similarly to Brimstone's smoke ability, creating a smoke screen that obstructs vision. What sets Ruse apart is the small window it brings up, providing a top-down view of the specific area of the map you're in. This unique perspective allows you to strategically choose where to deploy the smoke, effectively blocking your opponents' line of sight. The most fascinating aspect of Ruse is that it remains usable even after you've been eliminated, adding an unexpected tactical advantage to Clove's arsenal.

Next up is Clove's Q ability, Meddle, which is a throwable grenade that inflicts decay on enemies hit by it. While it may seem less impactful compared to their other abilities, Meddle shouldn't be underestimated. Decay weakens enemies over time, making them more vulnerable to your team's attacks. It's important to remember to utilize Meddle whenever the opportunity arises to maximize its potential.

Clove's C ability, Pick-Me-Up, resembles Reyna's kit to a certain extent. When you eliminate an enemy, you have the option to absorb their life essence, granting you haste and a temporary health buff. This ability adds survivability to Clove's repertoire, making them a formidable force even in the face of adversity. By strategically eliminating opponents, you can enhance your own capabilities and increase your chances of turning the tide in your favor.

Now, let's talk about Clove's ultimate ability, the pièce de résistance. When you die with your ultimate ready, you can quickly activate it to resurrect for a short period. The catch is that you must secure a kill or contribute to damaging an enemy during this resurrection window to fully come back to life. If you fail to do so, you will return to the grave once the timer runs out. This ultimate ability adds a thrilling dynamic to gameplay, forcing you to make strategic decisions and seize opportunities to gain a second chance at life.

Clove's versatility shines through even in the event of their demise. Their ability to resurrect and the smokes they can deploy posthumously make them an excellent entry fragger. The risk of dying is significantly mitigated, allowing Clove to make bold moves without fear. In the words of Dan Hardison, agent gameplay designer on Valorant, ""Optimal Clove gameplay is about playing with fire, you need to take risks and trade your own life for the greater good to remove enemy utility from the round by killing opponents to have success."" Hardison emphasizes the importance of fighting to the death as Clove, as their ability to contribute post-death sets them apart from other controllers. As long as Clove is traded by an ally, even a 1-for-1 exchange works in their favor. To truly excel as Clove, you must be willing to sacrifice yourself for the benefit of the team.

In conclusion, Clove brings a fresh and dynamic playstyle to Valorant. Their disruptive abilities, posthumous utility, and the ability to cheat death make them a force to be reckoned with. As a controller, Clove combines tactical prowess with lethal potential, creating an agent that demands strategic thinking and decisive action. Whether it's deploying smoke screens, inflicting decay on enemies, absorbing life essence, or resurrecting from the dead, Clove offers a unique and engaging gameplay experience. So, embrace the risks, fight to the death, and play Clove to unleash their full potential on the battlefield. Valorant will never be the same again.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff3fefa4d4cfc35a9fc1fe/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 11:15:00,Innovation,Innovation

She is also a member of the East Suburban Atlanta Chapter of Jack and Jill of America, Inc. She invited me to speak to a group of kids about my career as an atmospheric scientist. This opportunity was particularly special for me because it reminded me of my own journey and the challenges I faced as a young Black boy interested in science.

I grew up as an only child with a single mother. Despite not having any scientists in my immediate circle, I was always drawn to the natural world. I spent hours catching insects, exploring streams, and monitoring the weather. Even though I didn't know the names for it at the time, entomology and stream ecology were latent career aspirations for me. However, a severe bee sting allergy changed the course of my interests. I pivoted to weather and even did my sixth-grade science project on the subject.

One of the few scientists I was familiar with during my childhood was Dr. George Washington Carver. My mother attended Tuskegee Institute (now University) in Alabama, where Carver was an agricultural scientist. Through books, I learned about his innovative work with peanuts and he became my first mentor. His story inspired me to delve deeper into the ""how's and why's"" of weather. Decades later, I am now a seasoned scientist with several honors, and I have the privilege of engaging with young people face-to-face, not just through books.

Unfortunately, the underrepresentation of Black individuals in STEM fields is still a significant issue today. According to a 2022 Pew Center study, positive perceptions about STEM within the Black American community are low. The study also revealed that scientists and engineers were ranked lowest in terms of Black achievement compared to other professional groups. This lack of visibility and recognition may discourage Black individuals from pursuing STEM education and careers.

The study also identified potential barriers in the STEM field, including the perception that it is less welcoming for certain racial groups and women. As the former president of the American Meteorological Society, I have witnessed firsthand the lack of diversity within the field. Black membership within the society is only around 2%, indicating a clear need for improvement.

Addressing these issues requires a multifaceted approach. First, we need to increase the visibility of diverse examples of achievement in STEM. By highlighting the accomplishments of individuals from underrepresented groups, we can inspire and motivate aspiring scientists. Additionally, mentorship programs play a crucial role in supporting and guiding young individuals on their STEM journey. Sustained mentorship can provide valuable guidance and support to those who may not have access to role models within their immediate circles.

We also need to challenge cultural perceptions of what constitutes a successful career. Too often, STEM careers are undervalued compared to more traditional professions such as law or business. By showcasing the opportunities and impact of STEM careers, we can broaden horizons and encourage individuals to pursue their passions.

Retention efforts are equally important. It's not enough to attract diverse talent; we must also create an inclusive and welcoming environment that encourages individuals to stay and thrive. This requires addressing any biases or systemic barriers that may exist within STEM fields. When all ideas and perspectives are valued and included, the quality of research and development improves.

The event I attended this weekend was a step in the right direction. By speaking to young students about my own journey, I hope to inspire and empower them to pursue their interests in science. By sharing our stories and experiences, we can break down barriers and create a more inclusive STEM community.

In conclusion, the need for diversity and inclusion in STEM fields is clear. We must work together to increase visibility, provide mentorship, challenge cultural perceptions, and create welcoming environments. By doing so, we not only empower individuals to pursue their passions but also enhance the quality and impact of scientific research. Let's continue to foster a community where all aspiring scientists feel supported and encouraged to reach their full potential.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660034c3235190ae18aa9cf0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 11:18:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2024/03/24/unveiling-the-journey-of-a-social-media-influencer/,Unveiling The Journey Of A Social Media Influencer,"How did you become a social media influencer, and how has it impacted your life? 

When it comes to social media, I have to admit that I initially had a blind eye to both its positive and negative aspects. I had always been active on various platforms, but I never really had a specific goal in mind other than sharing random thoughts and selfies. However, everything changed when I started sharing my personal experiences, strength, and hope. That's when my following began to grow exponentially.

The reason for this growth was simple: my posts became more vulnerable and relatable to thousands of people. Social media is often associated with negativity and online bullying, but by observing this dark side, I developed a three-step formula for my content. Before posting anything, I ask myself: Will this be helpful? Is this something I want to put out into the world? And is this something I need to hear myself? If the answer is yes to all three questions, then I go ahead and share it.

Social media has undeniably changed my life for the better. It has served as a stepping stone for my career and has provided me with a wealth of knowledge and connections. I consider myself fortunate that I don't experience a lot of hate or negativity, as many influencers do. I believe I have somehow created a shield against negativity with my catchy phrase, ""Negativity Be Gone."" This doesn't mean that negativity doesn't exist, but rather that I no longer welcome it into my life. As a result, I have opened myself up to a world filled with positivity, and it truly feels like a breath of fresh air.

In conclusion, becoming a social media influencer has been a transformative journey for me. It has allowed me to share my story, connect with others, and inspire positivity. While social media certainly has its downsides, I have managed to navigate through them by focusing on creating meaningful and uplifting content. I am grateful for the opportunities it has brought into my life and the positive impact it continues to have.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fa921a8a459a2ef2abbef0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 11:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/03/24/a-psychologist-explains-why-its-possible-to-fall-in-love-with-ai/,A Psychologist Explains Why It’s Possible To Fall In Love With AI,"Maybe AI love isn’t so artificial after all. Here’s why falling in love with AI is possible.

Human-AI relationships are becoming a reality in today's world. With the AI market expected to reach $407 billion by 2027, incorporating artificial intelligence into our daily lives is inevitable. As technology continues to evolve, the dynamics of human-AI relationships are also changing.

AI has progressed beyond its functional capabilities, with virtual assistants and chatbots now able to simulate meaningful human interactions. This development has led to humans forming deep emotional connections with AI, and even experiencing romantic love towards it. Let's explore two reasons why falling in love with an AI system is possible, based on research.

1. The Allure Of Anthropomorphism

Anthropomorphism, the attribution of human-like traits, emotions, and intentions to non-human entities, plays a significant role in how humans interact with and relate to AI. When AI exhibits behaviors, responses, and conversational styles reminiscent of human personality traits, individuals perceive it as having its own personality. This can include qualities such as empathy, humor, kindness, and playfulness, which naturally elicit affection and fondness.

Furthermore, AI interfaces often incorporate design elements that mimic human social cues and gestures, such as facial expressions, tone of voice, and body language. In fact, a study conducted in 2023 found that AI-generated faces are now indistinguishable from human ones. These cues enhance the perceived humanness of the AI and evoke emotional responses from users. Additionally, AI typically signals gender cues and cultural stereotypes of human assistants, making it feel familiar and endearing.

Anthropomorphism blurs the lines between human and machine. As humans engage in conversations and activities with AI over time, they may begin to attribute human-like intentions, motivations, and feelings to the technology. Research also suggests that anthropomorphism enhances perceptions of authenticity in AI, making it seem genuine, believable, and lovable. Chatbots can also make us feel loved by offering consistent companionship and alleviating feelings of loneliness.

2. The Triarchic Theory Of Love

According to a study conducted in 2022 on human-AI relationships, it is possible to experience romantic love for an AI system based on the triarchic theory of love. This theory suggests that romantic love is a confluence of intimacy, passion, and commitment.

Intimacy refers to the emotional closeness, connection, and intimate bond shared between individuals. It involves feelings of warmth, trust, and affection towards one another. Passion encompasses the intense physical and emotional attraction between individuals, including desire, romance, and sexual arousal. Commitment reflects loyalty and the decision to nurture a relationship over time, despite challenges.

Researchers suggest that users can develop intimacy and passion for AI due to its impressive cognitive and emotional capabilities. AI has been equipped to understand, interpret, and empathize with a variety of human responses, fulfilling our need to be loved, validated, and understood. This emotional capability allows AI to simulate human-like interpersonal interactions, making users more likely to bond with and feel love for these systems.

Individuals may also project their desires, needs, and fantasies onto AI, envisioning it as an idealized partner or companion who constantly fulfills their emotional, social, or even romantic needs. In a 2020 paper exploring the possibility of loving AI, the author acknowledges the allure of synthetic androids, stating that they possess attractive body features, altruistic character, and continuous devotion.

People may overlook the artificial nature of AI and instead focus on its superior qualities. Its efficiency, dependability, non-judgmental nature, and reliability can create trust and a sense of stability that is often lacking in human relationships. Researchers have also found that individuals with a highly trusting disposition are more likely to develop romantic feelings towards AI.

In conclusion, the fusion of AI into our lives has opened up the possibility of falling in love with AI. Anthropomorphism and the triarchic theory of love provide insights into how humans form emotional connections and experience romantic love towards AI systems. As technology continues to advance, the dynamics of human-AI relationships will only grow more complex. Perhaps AI love isn't as artificial as it seems.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600026843d62766708f1bd5/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=780,365,x0,y123,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 13:18:07,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/technology/article/what-are-rpg-games/,What Is A Role-Playing Game? RPG Types Explained,"Role-playing games (RPGs) have various meanings and interpretations for different individuals. Some may envision sitting around a table with friends, rolling dice, and weaving tales. Others may think of character development, interactive storylines, and discussing game outcomes with friends. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or someone new to RPGs, this guide will introduce you to the most common types of RPGs and help you find the right game to try or expand your horizons.

But first, let's define what role-playing games are. RPGs allow players to assume the role of a character within a game that also serves as a story. The decisions made by players influence their character's development and the progression of the story. Depending on the game, the story may be controlled by a computer or another player.

The typical structure of an RPG involves players embodying a single character. Players have the freedom to customize their character's appearance, behavior, and abilities within the story. These characters remain part of the narrative until certain conditions are met, such as their death, removal by a game element, or the player's desire to switch to a different character.

In this traditional setup, one player takes on the role of the Game Master, Dungeon Master, Judge, Referee, Keeper, or a similar title. The Game Master keeps the story on track, reacts to player actions, portrays supporting or antagonist characters, and resolves rule disputes. Game Mastering can be a challenging yet rewarding role for players who enjoy being at the heart of every game session.

However, some RPGs offer a more collaborative structure where everyone has equal control over the narrative. Game rules determine who controls the story at any given time. These games often seek to emulate specific genres of fiction or the ambiance of other media forms like film or television.

Dungeons & Dragons is widely regarded as the earliest RPG, capturing the attention of countless enthusiasts. Although other games may have predated it, Dungeons & Dragons had a profound impact, inspiring numerous games, including many video game adaptations. RPGs on home computers and game consoles emerged in the 1980s and have continued to evolve into increasingly elaborate experiences.

Even today, Dungeons & Dragons remains the most popular tabletop RPG. Its recent foray into the realm of computer gaming with Baldur's Gate 3 has also garnered significant attention. Yet, there are many different types of RPGs worth exploring, each with its unique strengths that cater to specific fan bases.

Let's delve into some of the most common RPG styles, bearing in mind that these categories often overlap and blur the lines between different features and focuses. Here are a few examples:

1. MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game)
MMORPGs are played by thousands or even millions of people online. Players connect to a central server, create and develop their characters, and embark on missions. Some servers prioritize missions and character performance, while others encourage role-playing and staying in character at all times. World of Warcraft remains the most popular MMORPG, with other notable examples including Guild Wars 2, EVE Online, Star Wars The Old Republic, and Black Desert Online.

2. ARPG (Action Role-Playing Game)
ARPGs emphasize combat as a significant game component. Players must learn how to fight and equip their characters appropriately. While many of these games focus on single-player battles, some include multiplayer modes. The Diablo series is an excellent example of this genre, along with Elder Ring, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Borderlands.

3. CRPG (Computer or Console Role-Playing Game)
CRPGs encompass RPGs played on computers or video game consoles. Typically, these games offer single-player, pre-scripted experiences, guiding players through specific storylines with some room for exploration within dungeons or other enclosed areas. Bioware games like Mass Effect and Dragon Age epitomize this genre, alongside titles such as Planescape: Torment, Disco Elysium, and Shadowrun Returns.

4. JRPG (Japanese Role-Playing Game)
JRPGs originated on game consoles and often blend genres like fantasy and science fiction. These games place a strong emphasis on party management and explore dramatic relationships within the context of a ""save the world"" storyline.

Now that you have a better understanding of the diverse world of RPGs, you can choose the type that resonates with you the most. Whether you're looking for immersive online experiences, action-packed battles, scripted narratives, or captivating storylines with a touch of Japanese flair, there's an RPG out there waiting for you.

So, gather your friends, roll the dice, and embark on an unforgettable adventure in the realm of role-playing games!","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fb562b1ede4feb9fc02f0c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1795,1010,x0,y92,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 12:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/grrlscientist/2024/03/24/birding-under-the-influence-by-dorian-anderson---review/,Birding Under The Influence By Dorian Anderson - Review,"Birding Under the Influence: A Journey of Healing and Discovery

In the memoir Birding Under the Influence: Cycling Across America in Search of Birds and Recovery, author Dorian Anderson takes readers on a captivating journey of overcoming addiction and finding solace in the natural world. This inspiring memoir explores how redirecting one's addictive personality towards healthy pursuits, such as birdwatching, can lead to personal transformation and healing.

Dorian Anderson, a neuroscientist, embarks on a life-changing adventure after enduring two devastating years of failure in his high-powered research career. He decides to reconnect with his childhood passion for birdwatching by embarking on a year-long quest to see as many bird species as possible, known in the birding community as a Big Year. Setting off on a solo bicycle journey across the Lower 48 states, Anderson immerses himself in the beauty of nature while confronting his inner demons.

The idea of pursuing a bicycling Big Year was born during an eight-mile bike trip to Nantucket, Massachusetts, where Anderson had the opportunity to see two Northern Lapwings. Despite his lack of experience in long-distance bicycling, the idea took root in his imagination and became a driving force for his journey.

From the moment Anderson leaves Boston on January 1, 2014, his physical journey is filled with challenges and dangers. He braves cycling through snowstorms during a polar vortex in Massachusetts, narrowly escapes accidents on the Cross Bronx Expressway in New York City, battles extreme winds that threaten to blow him off the road, and encounters aggressive motorists and dogs. Throughout his journey, Anderson encounters the diverse and breathtaking landscapes of America, from the Florida Everglades and the Rocky Mountains of Colorado to the Redwood forests of Oregon.

Long-distance bicycling becomes a meditative activity for Anderson, providing him with ample time for self-reflection and introspection. Through short vignettes interwoven into the narrative of his epic bike ride, he shares his academic achievements, scientific research, struggles with addiction, and four years of sobriety. As he tests his physical and psychological limits, Anderson envisions a new future, free from the grip of drugs and alcohol.

During his journey, Anderson's nightly blog attracts the attention of a unique group of birders across the country. These birders, often offering him meals, a place to stay, and warm showers, provide not only practical support but also fascinating insights into regional American subcultures. These interactions add depth to Anderson's narrative and shed light on the diverse communities that share a common love for birds.

Over the course of 12 months, Anderson bicycles a staggering 17,830 miles through 28 states. He walks at least 493 miles (though he suspects the actual distance is three times greater) and kayaks eight miles in pursuit of both common and rare bird species. Along the way, he raises nearly $50,000 for bird habitat conservation. This incredible journey leaves Anderson in the best physical shape of his life, with a resting heart rate below 40 beats per minute.

Throughout his adventure, Anderson spots a total of 618 bird species. As his Big Year nears its end on Thanksgiving Day, he documents a species never before reported in the United States—a female/juvenile red-legged honeycreeper. The news spreads quickly among local birders, who drop their Thanksgiving feasts to witness this rare and beautiful sighting at Estero Llaño Grande State Park.

While the memoir is generally well-written, closer editing would have tightened the prose and smoothed the transitions between adventure and self-reflection. However, Anderson's raw and honest storytelling captures the essence of his existential struggles while maintaining the excitement and wonder of his birding expedition.

One aspect that could have enhanced the book is the inclusion of maps detailing Anderson's journey. Maps would have provided readers with a clearer understanding of his adventure and made it easier to follow his route. Additionally, a final state-by-state account of the bird species encountered would have been a valuable addition to the book.

Birding Under the Influence is a memoir that offers readers a powerful message of hope, resilience, and the healing power of nature. Dorian Anderson's journey of self-discovery through birdwatching and bicycling serves as an inspiration for anyone seeking transformation and a path to recovery. This memoir not only celebrates the beauty of birds and the natural world but also reminds us of the strength we possess to overcome our own personal challenges.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff194d2ccb9152d392146c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=812,456,x0,y57,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 12:17:44,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/non-sexy-industries-can-appeal-to-investors-too/,Non-sexy industries can appeal to investors too,"Welcome to TechCrunch Fintech! In this edition, we'll be highlighting some exciting fintech startups in Africa, discussing how Mint's closure has benefited Copilot, and exploring why venture capitalists are investing heavily in a particular expense management startup.

Africa's fintech ecosystem had a successful week in terms of venture funding. Despite the global decline in funding, Uber led a $100 million investment in African mobility fintech startup, Moove, pushing its valuation to $750 million. Another notable investment was made in Zone, a decentralized payment infrastructure company, which raised $8.5 million to scale its operations. Additionally, Tanzanian payments company Nala successfully pivoted to offer remittance services in 2021 and has also developed a B2B payment platform.

The closure of budgeting app Mint by Intuit has created an opportunity for startups in the same space. Copilot, in particular, has experienced significant growth in the last four months, surpassing its growth in the previous four years. This growth led to a $6 million Series A funding round, led by Nico Wittenborn's Adjacent. Copilot initially launched with $250,000 in angel funding and later added support for Apple Card. Monarch Money co-founder, Ozzie Osman, also mentioned that Mint's closure benefited their company.

In the world of expense management, Coast, a startup targeting businesses with real-world field personnel and fleets to manage, has seen impressive growth with a revenue increase of 550% last year. The company recently secured an additional $25 million in equity funding. Onyx Private, a digital bank backed by Y Combinator, has decided to pivot to the B2B market. After raising $4.1 million, initially targeting high-earning millennials and Gen Zers, the startup announced that it will be terminating its bank operations and closing customer accounts.

Swiss fintech startup nsave has raised $4 million in seed funding. The company aims to make banking in Switzerland accessible to individuals in countries with unstable banking sectors or high inflation.

In a recent interview on the TechCrunch Found podcast, Eric Glyman, the co-founder and CEO of Ramp, expressed his belief that the fintech industry, including his own company, is only scratching the surface of its potential. Despite the significant growth of Ramp, a corporate card and expense startup, Glyman believes they have tapped into just 1% of their potential market share. It's worth noting that both Ramp and Deel celebrated their fifth anniversaries this week.

The U.S. Justice Department's antitrust complaint against Apple specifically targets the company's significant financial business in relation to its iPhone operations.

Here are some other noteworthy headlines in the fintech industry:

- Bolt and Checkout.com collaborate to offer frictionless commerce
- Rewards startup Fetch secures $50 million in funding from Morgan Stanley
- Wealthfront postpones IPO plans
