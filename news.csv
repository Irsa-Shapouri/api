https://www.engadget.com/this-camera-captures-1563-trillion-frames-per-second-184651322.html,This camera captures 156.3 trillion frames per second,"Scientists have developed a groundbreaking scientific camera called SCARF (swept-coded aperture real-time femtophotography) that has the ability to capture images at an incredible encoding rate of 156.3 terahertz (THz) per pixel, which is equivalent to 156.3 trillion frames per second. This innovative camera has the potential to revolutionize fields that study micro-events that occur too quickly to be captured by current scientific sensors.

The SCARF camera has already been successful in capturing ultrafast events such as absorption in semiconductors and the demagnetization of metal alloys. The possibilities for this research are wide-ranging and could lead to breakthroughs in areas such as shock wave mechanics and the development of more effective medicine.

Leading the team behind this remarkable invention is Professor Jinyang Liang from Canada's Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS). Professor Liang, a globally recognized pioneer in ultrafast photography, built on his previous breakthroughs from a study conducted six years ago. The research conducted by Professor Liang and his team has been published in the prestigious journal Nature and has been summarized in a press release by INRS, with Science Daily being the first to report on it.

The research team, under the guidance of Professor Liang, took a fresh approach to ultrafast cameras. Traditionally, these cameras capture frames one at a time and piece them together to observe objects in motion. However, this sequential approach has its limitations, as it cannot effectively study phenomena such as femtosecond laser ablation, shock-wave interaction with living cells, and optical chaos. Professor Liang's team overcame these challenges with the development of SCARF.

SCARF utilizes a unique imaging modality that allows for ultrafast sweeping of a static coded aperture, without shearing the ultrafast phenomenon. This enables full-sequence encoding rates of up to 156.3 THz per pixel on a camera equipped with a charge-coupled device (CCD). These impressive results can be achieved in a single shot, with tunable frame rates and spatial scales in both reflection and transmission modes.

In simpler terms, SCARF uses computational imaging to capture spatial information by allowing light to enter its sensor at slightly different times. By not processing the spatial data immediately, the camera is able to capture extremely quick ""chirped"" laser pulses at an astonishing rate of up to 156.3 trillion times per second. The raw data from these images can then be processed by a computer algorithm that decodes the time-staggered inputs, transforming trillions of frames into a complete picture.

What makes SCARF even more impressive is that it utilizes off-the-shelf and passive optical components, making it a low-cost, low-power consumption solution with high measurement quality compared to existing techniques. While SCARF is currently more focused on research applications, the team is already collaborating with Axis Photonique and Few-Cycle, two companies, to develop commercial versions of the camera, potentially for use in other higher learning institutions and scientific organizations.

For a more detailed technical explanation of the camera and its potential applications, the full paper can be found in the journal Nature.

In conclusion, the development of the SCARF camera represents a significant breakthrough in the field of ultrafast photography. Its unprecedented encoding rate of 156.3 THz per pixel opens up new possibilities for studying micro-events that were previously inaccessible. With its unique imaging modality and computational capabilities, SCARF has the potential to advance various scientific fields and pave the way for future discoveries.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/SMiKpX01vf6kS9FeFTp8og--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02Mjg-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/08034950-eb9d-11ee-baef-05cbfe0fb11d,2024-03-26 18:46:51,Innovation,Innovation
