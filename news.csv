Welcome back, Strands players! While we have yet to come up with a catchy name for Strands players (let's avoid ""The Stranded"" for now), I'm here to provide you with some valuable hints and guidance to conquer today's tricky puzzle. So, let's dive in!

Understanding the Game: Strands vs. Wordle

Before we delve into today's puzzle, let's quickly understand the game itself. The New York Times' Strands puzzle is a delightful twist on the classic word search game. Each day, you'll be presented with a six by eight grid of letters. Your task is to find a group of words that share a common theme. As you discover these theme words, they will be highlighted in blue, assisting you in your quest.

But there's more! In addition to finding the theme words, you must also uncover a special word called a spangram. This spangram acts as the key to understanding the common thread among the words. Unlike the theme words, the spangram can even be a proper name. Once you find the spangram, it will be highlighted in yellow, leading you closer to victory.

Today's Theme Hint and Extra Clue

Now that we have a clear understanding of the game mechanics, let's move on to today's puzzle. The official theme hint for today's Strands puzzle is ""Sign language."" Intriguing, isn't it? But don't worry, I have an extra clue to help you along the way. The clue is ""Constellation."" Keep this in mind as you search for the words.

Spoiler Alert: Today's Answers Revealed

If you're ready to uncover today's answers, scroll down cautiously. I'll first reveal the spangram and its location on the grid, followed by the other words and their placement.

Drumroll, please!

Today's spangram is ASTROLOGY. Here's where you can find it on the grid:

Once you spot the spangram, the remaining words should fall into place. However, I must admit that today's puzzle proved to be quite challenging for me as well. Allow me to share my journey:

My Strands Adventure

At first, I stumbled upon ""Bull"" and ""Goat."" I thought I was on the right track, searching for animal-related words. However, this led me astray. I even tried ""Stop"" without success. It became evident that I needed to think outside the box.

Next, I discovered ""Virgin."" This further confused me until I came across ""OLOGY."" As I pondered words that could fit at the beginning of this word, I finally had a breakthrough: astrology. Suddenly, everything fell into place. The previous words were all constellations! I swiftly found ""Archer,"" ""Twins,"" and, after a bit of struggle, ""Scorpion.""

P.S. Coincidentally, I recently watched the film Taxi Driver after many years, and during one breakfast scene, the character Iris spoke at length about astrological signs. What a strange coincidence!

In the end, all's well that ends well. How did you fare with today's Strands puzzle? I'd love to hear about your experience. Connect with me on Twitter and Facebook.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have a lot in common when it comes to their growth trajectories. Both companies started with a core business that emerged from unexpected circumstances. AWS realized it could sell its internal services such as storage, compute, and memory, while Nvidia discovered that its GPU, originally designed for gaming, was well-suited for processing AI workloads.

In recent quarters, both companies have experienced explosive revenue growth. Nvidia's revenue has grown at triple digits, going from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024 to $22.1 billion in Q4 2024. Most of this growth has been in Nvidia's data center business. While AWS hasn't seen the same intense growth, it has consistently been a major revenue driver for Amazon. Both companies have benefited from being early market entrants, but competition has increased with the entry of Microsoft and Google into the cloud market.

The timing was crucial for both companies. As web apps and mobile emerged in the early 2010s, the cloud became a valuable resource for on-demand computing power. Enterprises realized the benefits of moving workloads and applications to the cloud instead of maintaining their own data centers. Similarly, the rise of AI and large language models coincided with the increased use of GPUs for processing these workloads.

AWS has become a highly profitable business with a run rate close to $100 billion. However, its growth has started to slow down, while Nvidia's growth is accelerating. This is partly due to the law of large numbers, which affects both companies. The question is whether Nvidia can sustain its growth and become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS.

Nvidia does have other businesses besides GPUs, but they are smaller revenue generators that are growing at a slower pace. While Nvidia's short-term financial outlook is strong, with expected revenue growth of 234% in the current quarter, its growth rate is expected to decline. Analysts predict revenue of $110.5 billion for the current fiscal year, an 81% increase from the previous year, but lower than the 126% gain in the previous fiscal year.

Despite the expected growth declines, Nvidia is still projected to scale its revenue past the $100 billion annual run rate mark. AI is expected to be a major driver of growth for Nvidia in the coming years, even as competition from AMD, Intel, and other chipmakers emerges. Nvidia currently dominates the chip market, but AMD is gaining traction at the board level.

In conclusion, Nvidia and AWS have experienced remarkable growth due to their early market advantage and the increasing demand for cloud services and AI processing. While AWS growth is slowing down, Nvidia's revenue is skyrocketing. The future looks promising for Nvidia, especially in the AI market, but competition will intensify in the coming years.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/techcrunch-mobility-the-wheels-are-starting-to-come-off-the-fisker-ev-bus/,TechCrunch Mobility: The wheels are starting to come off the Fisker EV bus,"Welcome to TechCrunch Mobility, your go-to source for all things transportation. In this edition, we'll be diving into the latest news and updates in the world of mobility. But first, let's touch on some recent developments on Capitol Hill that will have a significant impact on the automotive industry and, ultimately, consumers like you.

The Biden Administration has proposed two new standards through the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that aim to tighten regulations for U.S. automakers. While these regulations have been slightly softened to accommodate the industry, they still impose stricter requirements than before.

The DOE has introduced a ""petroleum equivalency factor"" that assigns a score to electric vehicles (EVs) under the government's corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. Initially, this proposal would have made it challenging for automakers to meet the CAFE standards, resulting in hefty fines. Fortunately, the revised version offers some relief.

On the other hand, the EPA has released tailpipe standards for 2027 to 2032 model year cars and light-duty trucks. These standards place greater demands on automakers but provide more flexibility in meeting them through various powertrain options. Unlike the original proposal, which required EV sales to account for 67% of the total U.S. passenger vehicle market by 2032, the new standards are technology-agnostic.

What does this mean for EV startups? Well, companies like Rivian, Tesla, and Lucid, which already meet the clean car standards, won't be significantly affected. However, legacy automakers that invest heavily in EV development while still profiting from internal combustion engine vehicles may face challenges. Plug-in hybrids could emerge as winners in this scenario.

Now, let's dive into some exciting news from the world of mobility. One notable development is Uber's first investment in an Africa-founded startup. Moove, an African mobility fintech that provides vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers, raised an impressive $100 million in a Series B funding round led by Uber. With this investment, Moove is now valued at $750 million. This move aligns with Uber's commitment to achieving a fully zero-emission fleet by 2040.

In other news, Clevon, a company specializing in autonomous delivery technology, has managed to secure funding despite previous concerns about its financial situation. The company is now in an exclusivity agreement for a merger with an American electric vehicle company, expected to be finalized in the first half of June. Although cost reductions have been necessary, Clevon remains optimistic about its future.

Additionally, Amber, a Bay Area startup that recently launched an aftermarket Tesla extended warranty product, raised $3.18 million in a seed round. This funding will support the company's mission to provide reliable and affordable extended warranties for Tesla owners. Candela, an electric boat maker, also secured $25 million in a funding round led by Groupe Beneteau. The company aims to revolutionize the boating industry with its electric-powered vessels.

These are just a few highlights from the world of mobility this week. Stay tuned for more exciting updates and developments in our next edition of TechCrunch Mobility.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1363022906.jpg?resize=1200,730",2024-03-24 19:00:33,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikestubbs/2024/03/24/sentinels-win-the-500000-valorant-masters-madrid-tournament/,"Sentinels Win The $500,000 ‘Valorant’ Masters Madrid Tournament","Sentinels emerged as the victorious team at the Valorant Masters Madrid tournament, claiming the championship title and a handsome $250,000 cash prize. The final match between Sentinels and Gen.G was a thrilling showdown, featuring two teams that had proven themselves to be the best in the competition.

Gen.G started off strong with a commanding 13-8 win on Breeze. However, Sentinels quickly regrouped and fought back, taking Bind 14-12 after an intense overtime battle. The third map, Ascent, saw Gen.G regain their winning momentum with another 13-8 victory, putting them on match point. But Sentinels refused to back down and delivered an impressive performance on Split, securing a 13-10 win and forcing a decisive final map.

The final map, Icebox, was a nail-biting affair, with both teams neck and neck at 5-5 after 10 rounds. Sentinels then seized the opportunity and secured a 7-5 lead going into the second half of the match. After the break, Sentinels continued to dominate, extending their lead to 9-5 before Gen.G managed to secure another round. However, that would be the last victory for Gen.G, as Sentinels emerged triumphant with a final score of 13-6, clinching both the map and the championship.

While Sentinels walked away with the grand prize of $250,000, Gen.G earned a commendable $100,000 for their second-place finish. Third-place finishers, Paper Rex, took home $65,000, while LOUD, who secured the fourth spot, received $35,000.

Prior to the final match, Gen.G was considered the slight favorite, having defeated Sentinels in the upper bracket final just a few days earlier. Gen.G showcased their dominance throughout the tournament, boasting a 2-0 record in the Swiss stage with wins against Loud and EDward Gaming. They continued their winning streak in the knockout stage, defeating Paper Rex in the opening round and setting the stage for their first encounter with Sentinels, which they won 2-1.

Sentinels also demonstrated their strength en route to the final, going undefeated in the Swiss stage with victories over Team Heretics and Karmine Corp. They triumphed over Loud in the knockout stage's opening round before succumbing to Gen.G. However, Sentinels swiftly rebounded and secured their spot in the final by defeating Paper Rex.

The tournament also introduced a new Valorant agent named Clove. This character possesses the unique ability to resurrect and create smoke screens from beyond the grave. Clove's arrival brought excitement to the tournament, as players eagerly explored the agent's capabilities. Hopefully, Clove will prove to be a more impactful addition than the underwhelming previous agent, Iso.

In conclusion, Sentinels emerged as the champions of the Valorant Masters Madrid tournament, showcasing their resilience and skill throughout the competition. Gen.G put up a commendable fight, but ultimately fell short. The tournament not only provided thrilling matches but also introduced the intriguing new agent, Clove. With such excitement and talent on display, Valorant fans were surely captivated by the intense action and eagerly await future tournaments.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600832a1389114562dc7741/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 17:13:21,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewwight/2024/03/24/helping-patients-access-sickle-cell-disease-treatments-in-west-africa/,Helping Patients Access Sickle Cell Disease Treatments In West Africa,"A researcher from Cameroon is on a mission to help patients in low-income countries in West Africa afford the medicine they need for sickle cell disease. Dr. Marthe-Sandrine Eiymo Mwa Mpollo, a scientist and co-founder of NaYa Health, recognized that simply having a drug for sickle cell disease is not enough for patients; affordability is key.

Sickle cell disease affects over 4 million people worldwide, with about 80% of cases occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. Shockingly, 89% of women in central and west Africa lack access to universal medical coverage. This lack of access inspired Dr. Mpollo to create NaYa Health, a digital patient assistance platform that helps underserved patients without insurance gain timely access to medication, even when they are short of cash.

Through community savings, deferred payments, and a portable health-only savings account, NaYa Health aims to manage health risks and safeguard earnings for those living without insurance. In a pilot implementation in Cameroon's capital, NaYa Health has already made a significant impact. It has boosted the ability of informal workers to handle unexpected challenges, increased income for local medical providers, and guaranteed access to critical services.

The success of NaYa Health has not gone unnoticed, as it was selected for the financial inclusion challenge by MIT Solve. Dr. Mpollo is thrilled to be fulfilling the promise of research findings, allowing patients with sickle cell disease in Cameroon to access the medicines they need without delay, even when they are short of cash.

Dr. Mpollo's passion for medicine in Cameroon was ignited during her childhood when she watched ""doctors without borders"" shows in the late 1980s. Witnessing the impact of sickle cell disease on the quality of life for affected individuals and their families, she became determined to deliver effective healthcare in limited resource settings. Although she initially set out to become a medical doctor, her journey led her to life science research in Canada and the US, where she obtained a doctorate from the Faculty of Medicine of Cincinnati. Her focus was on developing therapies for sickle cell disease, the first discovered genetic disease afflicting many individuals of African descent.

After publishing scientific papers on the mechanism causing lung damage in sickle cell patients and communicating her research findings, Dr. Mpollo realized that access to medication is crucial for research to realize its full life-saving potential. This realization prompted her to launch NaYa Health. She believes that scientists from the Global South have a unique perspective on the limitations of their settings, particularly when it comes to affordability, access, and cultural acceptance of research findings. By tailoring their research to be more impactful for their communities, these scientists can work with local actors to define or adapt distribution models for scientific findings.

While NaYa Health is making strides in Cameroon, another team in Zambia is using artificial intelligence to improve care for pregnant women. Tafadzwa Kalisto Munzwa, founder and CEO of Dawa Health, is leading the DawaMom project. This initiative leverages AI tools, last-mile health workers, mobile clinics, and digital tools to enhance maternal and child health. Despite a significant decrease in Zambia's death rate for pregnant mothers between 2000 and 2017, there is still a 1% risk of death in pregnancy or childbirth for Zambian women.

Dawa Health has over 60 community health workers supporting in-community healthcare through DawaMom, and more than 800 mothers have signed up on the mobile platform. The generative AI models used in this project are patient-facing and respond to patient inquiries, providing valuable information and guidance.

In conclusion, researchers and entrepreneurs like Dr. Marthe-Sandrine Eiymo Mwa Mpollo and Tafadzwa Kalisto Munzwa are making a significant impact on healthcare in Africa. Through innovative solutions and a deep understanding of the challenges faced by underserved communities, they are working towards better access to medication and improved maternal and child health. Their dedication and passion for healthcare in limited resource settings are truly inspiring.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66009a73668df974c31e0a4f/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=579,579,x127,y431,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 17:54:08,Innovation,Innovation
