The iPhone 15 series has fallen behind the competition in terms of AI integration, with Android devices taking the lead in promoting generative AI capabilities. While current AI features are present in iOS, generative AI will make its debut in the upcoming iOS 18, expected to launch at the Worldwide Developer Conference this summer and debut on the iPhone 16 lineup.

Apple, like other smartphone manufacturers, will focus on a combination of on-device and cloud-based AI processing. Leveraging its reputation for prioritizing data privacy, Apple will likely emphasize local processing, while utilizing the cloud for more intensive AI tasks.

Reports suggest that Apple is in talks with Google to utilize its Gemini generative AI service for cloud-based processing. Despite Google’s ties to the Android platform, the two tech giants have collaborated in various areas, including Google serving as the default search engine on Apple devices. This partnership could provide Google with access to a vast user base of iPhone owners utilizing AI technology.

Given restrictions on Google’s Gemini service in China, Apple is exploring a collaboration with Baidu to incorporate its cloud-based AI services into iOS 18 and the iPhone 16 lineup. Samsung has also adopted a similar strategy, utilizing Google’s Gemini for AI services and partnering with Baidu for operations in China.

It will be interesting to see how Apple differentiates its AI offerings from competitors when they are all built on similar underlying technology. Stay tuned for more updates on Apple’s AI initiatives in Forbes’ Apple Loop news digest, where you can also catch up on the latest iPhone, Mac, and App Store news.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6470e48fe2490b1a1cb845f0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3561,2003,x374,y223,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-23 19:31:06
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/apple-sued-microsofts-ai-ambitions-and-nvidia-surprises/,"Apple sued, Microsoft's AI ambitions and Nvidia's surprises","Welcome to this edition of Week in Review, where we bring you the latest news and updates from the tech world. In this week's issue, we have some significant developments in the Apple antitrust lawsuit and Microsoft's AI ambitions. So, let's dive right in!

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has joined international regulators in accusing Apple of using monopolistic tactics to lock in iPhone users. Apple, in response, argues that the DOJ's actions could undermine what its users love about its phones and ecosystem.

While the DOJ's lawsuit draws parallels between Apple and Microsoft in the 1990s, there are key differences between the two companies and their efforts to retain customers. However, experts predict that it may take three to five years for the lawsuit to reach a resolution, so we shouldn't expect immediate results.

Moving on to other news, Microsoft has acquired the co-founders of Inflection AI, a prominent AI startup. Mustafa Suleyman will now lead Microsoft AI's consumer-facing unit, while Karén Simonyan becomes the EVP and CEO of the same group. This acquisition comes after Inflection raised $1.3 billion, with Microsoft being the largest investor.

Nvidia made some surprising announcements at its GTC developer conference. CEO Jensen Huang predicted that artificial general intelligence would be a reality within five years. Additionally, Nvidia unveiled a new AI platform called GR00T, designed for humanoid robots.

In another interesting development, Google is reportedly in talks with Apple to deploy its AI model on upcoming iOS updates. It remains to be seen whether this will be a temporary solution until Apple's own AI efforts catch up, the start of a long-term partnership, or simply an ongoing negotiation.

In the realm of hacking and privacy, the Biden administration is forming an international coalition to combat commercial spyware. Interestingly, some investors joining the coalition were previously involved in the spyware business themselves, highlighting the complex nature of the industry.

Furthermore, a recent hack disrupted a $5 million Apex Legends tournament, with the hackers claiming it was done for fun and to expose vulnerabilities to developers. In addition, Glassdoor users have reported that their real names are being added to their profiles without consent, forcing them to delete their accounts.

Turning to funding and IPOs, Reddit's IPO had a strong start, with the stock jumping 48% on its first day of trading. Astera Labs, a company specializing in connectivity hardware for cloud computing data centers, also saw a successful IPO, with its stock closing at $62.03 on day one.

Finally, The Browser Company, the startup behind the Arc browser, raised $50 million in funding. The company has an ambitious vision to replace PCs with browsers but faces challenges in defining its path to monetization.

In our bonus round, we explore why AI struggles with spelling, despite its vast potential. We also discuss Fisker's production pause due to financial difficulties and the importance of reviewing AI systems like ChatGPT and Gemini, even if comprehensive reviews are challenging.

That wraps up this edition of Week in Review. Stay tuned for more exciting tech news and updates in the coming weeks!","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/apple-antitrust-doj-splash.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-23 20:15:37
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/23/explained-the-difference-between-a-solar-eclipse-and-a-lunar-eclipse/,Explained: The Difference Between A Solar Eclipse And A Lunar Eclipse,"Have you ever wondered about the difference between a solar eclipse and a lunar eclipse? In the coming weeks, we are fortunate enough to witness both of these extraordinary celestial events. On Monday, March 25, we will experience a lunar eclipse, followed by a solar eclipse on Monday, April 8. Although these phenomena are distinct, they share a common factor—the alignment of celestial bodies.

Let's delve into the specifics of each type of eclipse. A lunar eclipse occurs when Earth's shadow is cast onto the moon, while a solar eclipse takes place when the moon obstructs the sun's light, causing a shadow on Earth. Due to the subtle differences in the orbital planes of the Earth and the moon around the sun, both types of eclipses are relatively rare.

Now, what exactly causes a lunar eclipse? A lunar eclipse can only occur during a full moon when Earth is positioned between the sun and the moon, projecting a shadow into space. While full moons happen every 29 days, the moon rarely passes through Earth's shadow. When it does, a lunar eclipse occurs.

On the other hand, a solar eclipse can only happen during a new moon when the moon is positioned between the sun and Earth, casting a shadow onto Earth. A new moon occurs every 29 days, approximately two weeks after a full moon. However, it is quite unusual for the moon to block the sun as seen from Earth. When this rare phenomenon does occur, it is known as a solar eclipse.

What causes a total lunar eclipse? A total lunar eclipse is the result of a perfect alignment of the sun, Earth, and moon. Earth possesses two shadows—an outer penumbral shadow and a darker central umbral shadow. When a full moon passes into Earth's umbra, it receives no direct sunlight. Instead, the moon's surface is illuminated by sunlight refracted by Earth's atmosphere. This creates a breathtaking display of a thousand sunsets on the lunar surface, giving it a pinkish-red hue for a brief period. If you were standing on the moon during a lunar eclipse, you would be enveloped in this mesmerizing pinkish-red light and witness a partial or total solar eclipse.

On March 25, we will witness a penumbral lunar eclipse, as the full ""Worm Moon"" will pass through Earth's penumbra—the lighter part of the shadow.

Now, let's explore the causes of a total solar eclipse. A total solar eclipse occurs when there is a perfect alignment of the sun, moon, and Earth, along with a celestial coincidence. During a new moon, the moon possesses two shadows—an outer penumbral shadow and a dark central umbral shadow. When the moon perfectly obscures the entire sun—a feat it can accomplish due to its small size in relation to the sun and its close proximity to Earth—its umbra is projected onto Earth.

As the moon orbits from west to east, the shadow of the moon traverses Earth's surface. This direction coincides with Earth's rotation, resulting in a slowed movement of the moon's shadow. Consequently, an umbral shadow—a path of totality—is created, allowing observers within this path to witness an awe-inspiring spectacle: a total solar eclipse. If you were positioned on the moon during a total solar eclipse, you would witness the moon's shadow crossing Earth.

On April 8, a total solar eclipse will occur, as the new ""Pink Moon"" perfectly obstructs the sun, projecting its umbral shadow over North America.

One may wonder why lunar and solar eclipses are rare occurrences. Eclipses of all kinds are relatively infrequent due to the moon's orbit around Earth, which is tilted approximately 5 degrees with respect to the sun's path through the sky. Consequently, the moon's path intersects with the sun twice during each orbit, which occurs every month. However, for a solar or lunar eclipse to transpire, the moon must be in its new or full phase. This specific scenario occurs twice a year, resulting in two ""eclipse seasons"" when solar and lunar eclipses consistently take place. Nevertheless, the majority of solar eclipses are either partial or annular (""ring of fire""), while most lunar eclipses are penumbral or partial.

Let's take a look at the upcoming lunar and solar eclipses in 2024 and 2025:

2024:
- March 25: Penumbral lunar eclipse (visible in North America)
- April 8: Total solar eclipse (visible in North America)
- September 17: Partial lunar eclipse (visible in North America)
- October 2: Annular solar eclipse (visible in the Pacific Ocean and South America)

2025:
- March 13: Total lunar eclipse (visible in North America)
- March 29: Partial solar eclipse (visible in Canada and northern Europe)
- September 7: Total lunar eclipse (visible in Asia)
- September 21: Partial solar eclipse (visible in Antarctica)

Keep in mind that the dates and visibility of these eclipses may vary depending on your location.

In conclusion, the beauty and rarity of both lunar and solar eclipses are undoubtedly captivating. These celestial events serve as a reminder of the wonders of our universe. So, mark your calendars and prepare to witness the magic unfold in the sky. May you have clear skies and wide eyes as you marvel at these extraordinary phenomena.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65f6b43702078076f68d7fcf/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-23 19:00:00

Severino was disqualified for the bite in the second round. 

Pressure in combat sports can lead to unexpected actions, as demonstrated in the recent UFC Fight Night: Ribas vs. Namajunas event. Making his UFC debut, Igor Severino shocked viewers by biting his opponent, fellow Brazilian Andre Lima, during their preliminary bout's second round.

The disqualifying bite, clearly seen in images showing bite marks, occurred while Severino was behind Lima in a standing grappling position. This incident has likely jeopardized Severino's future prospects in the UFC, despite the potential he held as a newcomer.

Severino's record took a hit with this loss, marking his first defeat as he now stands at 9-1, while Lima maintained his undefeated status at 8-0. UFC CEO Dana White wasted no time in severing ties with Severino, emphasizing the gravity of his actions and the missed opportunity for the young fighter.

Biting in combat sports is a serious offense, and Severino's actions have consequences beyond the disqualification. Moving forward, Severino will need to rebuild his reputation in smaller promotions before considering a return to mainstream MMA organizations like the UFC or Professional Fighters League.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2024/03/23/the-invisible-shield-aims-to-makes-public-health-more-visible/,‘The Invisible Shield’ Aims To Makes Public Health More Visible,"There’s a saying that offensive linemen in football don’t get much recognition unless they make mistakes. The same can be said about public health, which is why a new TV series called The Invisible Shield aims to bring more visibility to the importance of public health. This four-episode series will make its PBS debut on March 26 at 10 pm.

The title, The Invisible Shield, highlights the fact that while the public health system and its professionals work tirelessly to protect everyone, they often go unnoticed. The show sheds light on the lack of attention given to public health, compared to topics like celebrity news and consumerism. As Kelly Henning, MD, Public Health Program Lead for Bloomberg Philanthropies, explains, ""The better public health works, the less likely you are to see it."" Unfortunately, the public health system has been deteriorating for years, but most people are oblivious to this reality.

The Covid-19 pandemic should have exposed the chronic underfunding and lack of support for public health systems. If these systems had received more resources, countless lives could have been saved and suffering reduced. However, political and business leaders only briefly acknowledged the issue before returning to their own self-interests. Some even propagated misinformation and disinformation about public health, exacerbating the problem. Although the pandemic temporarily brought public health into the spotlight, the necessary resources did not follow. It shouldn't take another disaster to realize the importance of supporting the public health system. Waiting until a building burns down to install smoke alarms and fire extinguishers is not a wise approach.

To address this issue, RadicalMedia produced The Invisible Shield with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies. The aim is to draw attention to public health amidst the constant hype surrounding celebrities, influencers, politicians, and businesses. Without proper marketing, public health's impact on everyone's lives can be undervalued. Vaccination, antibiotics, clean water supplies, and anti-pollution efforts are just a few examples of public health accomplishments that have saved countless lives. As Josh Sharfstein, MD, Distinguished Professor of the Practice at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, points out, ""Public health saved your life today but you didn't even know it.""

While four episodes cannot fully capture all that public health has accomplished over the years, the first episode, ""The Old Playbook,"" explores how public health has contributed to doubling life expectancy since 1900. It also highlights the current risks facing the public health system and how it applied lessons from past epidemics and pandemics to combat Covid-19.

The Invisible Shield offers a unique perspective on public health and aims to create awareness about its importance. By showcasing its impact on individuals' lives, the series encourages viewers to recognize and support the public health system. It's time to appreciate the invisible shield that has been working tirelessly to protect us all.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff76b9cc324c33ed5484d7/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-23 21:25:08
https://www.forbes.com/sites/anuradhavaranasi/2024/03/24/which-adhd-medications-could-lower-risk-of-suicide--hospitalization/,These ADHD Medications Could Lower Risk Of Suicide & Hospitalization,"ADHD Medications May Reduce Suicide Risk and Psychiatric Hospitalizations

A recent study conducted by researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, has found that individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) who were prescribed ADHD stimulant medications had a lower risk of attempting suicide or dying by suicide. The study, which included 221,714 adults and adolescents with ADHD, also found that the use of ADHD medications was associated with fewer psychiatric hospitalizations.

The researchers observed that four specific ADHD medications - amphetamine, lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate - were linked to a decreased risk of hospitalization due to psychiatric co-morbidities. They also found that lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate were associated with a decreased risk of suicidal behavior.

A previous study conducted in Sweden in 2019 revealed that individuals with ADHD have a higher prevalence of psychiatric co-morbidity compared to those without ADHD. Conditions such as major depressive disorder, panic disorder, substance abuse, generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, PTSD, and psychotic symptoms were included in the definition of psychiatric co-morbidity. The study also reported that psychiatric co-morbidity increased the risk of mortality among people with ADHD, particularly when the comorbidity involved substance use disorder.

While atomoxetine, an ADHD medication, was not associated with a lower risk of psychiatric hospitalizations or suicidal behavior, the researchers found a link between atomoxetine and fewer hospitalizations for non-psychiatric co-morbidities.

The researchers emphasized that ADHD medications, especially stimulants, have been shown to improve functioning and quality of life in addition to addressing ADHD core symptoms. However, the long-term effectiveness and safety of ADHD pharmacotherapies are still not fully understood.

To investigate the association between specific ADHD medication use and the risk of psychiatric hospitalization, the researchers included individuals between the ages of 16 to 65 years old who had received an ADHD diagnosis in Sweden between 2006 and 2021. They analyzed the participants' healthcare data from the Swedish National Patient Register and tracked their prescribed ADHD medication purchases through the Prescribed Drug Register.

Among the study participants, methylphenidate was the most commonly used ADHD medication, followed by lisdexamphetamine and atomoxetine. The participants underwent a 15-year follow-up period, and 56% of them had a psychiatric co-morbidity. Anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and stress-related disorders were the most common co-morbidities, and approximately 26% of the participants had been hospitalized due to a psychiatric co-morbidity.

The study findings revealed that lisdexamphetamine was associated with a decreased risk of psychiatric hospitalizations among adolescents, young adults, and adults aged 30 and older. However, methylphenidate seemed to be less effective among older adults. Atomoxetine, on the other hand, was linked to a decreased risk of hospitalization among women but not men.

The overall effect of ADHD medications on psychiatric outcomes was beneficial, and the researchers noted a decreased risk of non-psychiatric hospitalizations as well. However, they acknowledged concerns about potential adverse effects of long-term stimulant use, such as increased blood pressure and heart rate, the risk of cardiovascular diseases, seizures, and possibly psychosis or mania.

The study, published in JAMA Network Open on March 20, 2024, highlights the potential benefits of ADHD medications in reducing suicide risk and psychiatric hospitalizations among individuals with ADHD. Further research is needed to fully understand the long-term effectiveness and safety of these medications.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/63c28dbb82c31b7412c92cf2/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 04:09:46

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/mallard-bay-airbnb-for-guided-hunting-and-fishing/,Mallard Bay is the Airbnb for guided hunting and fishing,"Americans spent over $144.8 billion on fishing and hunting in 2022, as reported by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Within this industry, guided hunting and fishing excursions play a significant role, traditionally booked offline via phone calls and paid for with physical checks or cash. Mallard Bay, a Houston-based startup, aims to revolutionize this process.

Mallard Bay serves as a marketplace where hunting and fishing enthusiasts can easily discover and book guided tours online, similar to booking a hotel. Additionally, the platform functions as a vertical SaaS solution for outfitters, enabling them to streamline their back-office operations and offer services like marketing.

Recently, Mallard Bay secured a $4.6 million Series A funding round led by Soul Venture Partners, with participation from Acadian Capital Ventures and other angel investors. The inspiration behind the startup came from a personal hunting trip mishap experienced by co-founder and CEO Logan Meaux. This incident sparked the idea to create a more efficient and transparent booking platform for outdoor enthusiasts.

Initially envisioned as an Airbnb-like marketplace for guided hunts, Mallard Bay pivoted its strategy after engaging with outfitters and guides. Recognizing the need to provide additional value, the team developed Guidetech, a comprehensive back-office solution tailored to the needs of outfitters.

By collaborating with hunting influencer Toby Brohlin, Mallard Bay gained traction and attracted more outfitters to the platform. Brohlin alone generated over $1 million in gross bookings, contributing to the platform's overall success. In 2023, Mallard Bay facilitated over $6 million in gross bookings and anticipates reaching $30-35 million in 2024.

Despite facing challenges in securing investor interest due to misconceptions about the hunting industry, Mallard Bay emphasizes its commitment to ethical hunting practices and conservation efforts. The founders aim to educate investors on the positive impact of responsible hunting and fishing activities on wildlife preservation.

In a tech landscape dominated by mainstream industries, Mallard Bay stands out as a unique player in the hunting and fishing sector. The company's rapid growth, with bookings increasing by 600% year over year since its launch in 2021, showcases the untapped potential within niche markets. As the saying goes, ""the riches are in the niches,"" highlighting the lucrative opportunities present in specialized industries.

The outdoor recreation sector, encompassing activities like hunting, fishing, hiking, and birdwatching, represents a lucrative market valued at over $394 billion in the U.S. However, many segments within this industry still rely on outdated and cumbersome processes. Personal experiences, such as the challenges of finding parking for popular hiking trails, underscore the need for innovative solutions like Mallard Bay to enhance the outdoor activity experience.

In conclusion, Mallard Bay's success story exemplifies the power of innovation in transforming traditional industries. By combining technology with a passion for the outdoors, the startup has redefined the way hunting and fishing excursions are booked and managed. As the company continues to expand its reach and impact, it paves the way for a more seamless and enjoyable outdoor adventure experience for enthusiasts nationwide.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/greysen-johnson-cZVzzFadTMc-unsplash.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-23 16:00:34

Unlike Apple's emergency SOS feature, which is limited to emergencies only, Google's update allows users to expand their cellular accounts to include a satellite add-on. This enables core messaging apps to utilize satellite connectivity, ensuring users stay connected even in areas with poor cellular coverage.

The latest Android 15 developer preview showcases the integration of satellite connectivity, with new UI elements and APIs that enhance the user experience. This update allows SMS/MMS/RCS apps to leverage satellite connectivity for seamless messaging, bridging the gap between traditional cellular networks and satellite technology.

While Apple also offers satellite connectivity on select iPhone models, Android's approach seems more inclusive and forward-thinking. With the potential for direct-to-phone satellite connectivity on the horizon, Android users can look forward to a more robust and reliable messaging experience.

The partnership between Google and T-Mobile for satellite messaging hints at a future where smartphone connectivity transcends traditional cellular networks. Recent tests by SpaceX and Samsung have shown promising results, paving the way for widespread adoption of satellite technology in smartphones.

As Android and iPhone continue to converge, Google's proactive approach to innovation sets a new standard for the industry. With rumors of Gemini, Google's AI technology, making its way to iPhone, the boundaries between the two ecosystems are becoming increasingly blurred.

Overall, Google's focus on satellite messaging and connectivity signifies a significant leap forward for Android users. As the smartphone landscape evolves, Android's commitment to cutting-edge features and seamless integration positions it as a frontrunner in the race for technological advancement.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65d79ec3dadcd6b682668331/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-23 19:17:25
