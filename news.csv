She is also a member of the East Suburban Atlanta Chapter of Jack and Jill of America, Inc. and was instrumental in organizing the event. Dr. Colenda Arvelo-Jefferson, an accomplished scientist herself, also played a key role in making this event happen.
The purpose of the event was to expose young students, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds, to the field of atmospheric science and inspire them to pursue STEM careers. As an experienced atmospheric scientist and former president of the American Meteorological Society, I was honored to be invited to speak at the event.
During my presentation, I shared my personal journey in science and the challenges I faced as a young Black boy with aspirations of becoming a scientist. Growing up as an only child of a single mother, I spent a lot of time exploring nature and developing a fascination for insects, streams, and the weather. Little did I know at the time that entomology and stream ecology would eventually become my career passions.
However, a severe bee sting allergy redirected my focus towards weather. In sixth grade, I did a science project on weather, marking the beginning of my journey as a meteorologist. While there were no scientists in my immediate circle, I found inspiration in the pages of books about Dr. George Washington Carver, an agricultural scientist at Tuskegee Institute. His innovative work with peanuts fascinated me and served as my first form of mentorship.
As I grew older and pursued a career in atmospheric science, I realized that not many Black kids were choosing STEM careers. Unfortunately, this trend still persists today. A 2022 Pew Center study revealed that positive perceptions about STEM within the Black community are low. Scientists and engineers are often ranked lowest in terms of achievement, while professional athletes and musicians are seen as the highest achievers.
The lack of visible examples of Black achievement in STEM fields is one factor that deters Black individuals from pursuing STEM education and careers. The study also highlighted that STEM fields feel less welcoming for certain racial groups and women. As someone who has experienced and observed these challenges, I understand the importance of addressing these barriers and creating a more inclusive STEM ecosystem.
One way to strengthen this ecosystem is by increasing visible examples of achievement from diverse groups. By showcasing successful individuals from various backgrounds, we can inspire and motivate young students to pursue STEM careers. Mentorship is another crucial aspect that can make a significant difference in guiding and supporting aspiring scientists.
Additionally, it's essential to challenge cultural perceptions of what successful careers look like. STEM careers should be seen as viable alternatives to traditional professions like law or business. Retention efforts are also crucial in keeping students and professionals engaged in the STEM field. By creating a welcoming and inclusive environment, we can ensure that everyone feels valued and supported.
Finally, it's important to recognize that STEM research and development thrive when diverse perspectives and ideas are brought to the table. Embracing diversity and inclusivity leads to more innovative and impactful outcomes. This is why it's crucial for organizations and institutions to prioritize diversity in their STEM initiatives.
The event I spoke at this weekend was a step towards inspiring and engaging young students in atmospheric science. With the support of organizations like Jack and Jill of America, Inc., we can continue to make a difference and create a more diverse and inclusive STEM community.
In conclusion, my experience speaking to a group of students about my career as an atmospheric scientist was a full circle moment for me. It reminded me of the challenges I faced as a young Black boy interested in science and the importance of representation and mentorship. By addressing the barriers that deter underrepresented individuals from pursuing STEM careers and creating a welcoming and inclusive environment, we can shape lives and change perceptions. Together, we can build a stronger and more diverse STEM community for the future.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660034c3235190ae18aa9cf0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 11:18:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have surprising similarities in their growth trajectories. Both companies emerged from accidental discoveries in their core businesses. AWS realized it could sell its internal services, while Nvidia found that gaming GPUs were well-suited for AI workloads. This led to explosive revenue growth for both companies, with Nvidia's revenue growing from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024 to $22.1 billion in Q4 2024. However, the majority of this growth was in Nvidia's data center business.

While AWS has consistently been a revenue driver for Amazon, its growth has slowed down. On the other hand, Nvidia's growth is taking off. It's important to note that this growth may not be sustainable in the long term, especially if the GPU market tightens. Nvidia does have other businesses, but they are smaller revenue generators growing at a slower rate than the GPU data center business.

In the short term, Nvidia's revenue growth has been astronomical. The company anticipates $24 billion worth of revenue in its current quarter, with a growth rate of around 234% compared to the previous year's first quarter. However, this growth rate is expected to decline as the company's revenue ramp slows down. Analysts predict Nvidia to generate $110.5 billion worth of revenue in the current fiscal year, up just over 81% from the previous year. While this is still impressive, it is lower than the 126% gain posted in the previous fiscal year.

Despite the expected growth decline, Nvidia is projected to continue scaling its revenue past the $100 billion annual run rate mark for the next several quarters. AI is expected to be a significant driver of growth for Nvidia in the coming years, even with increased competition from AMD, Intel, and other chipmakers. Nvidia currently holds a dominant position in the market, but competition is expected to intensify. However, the company has a strong foothold and can afford to cede some market share.

Looking at the chip level, Nvidia is firmly in control, according to IDC. However, at the board level, AMD is gaining ground, as shown by market share numbers from Jon Peddie Research (JPR). While Nvidia still dominates, AMD's presence is becoming stronger.

In conclusion, Nvidia has the potential to become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS. Its growth in recent quarters has been remarkable, and analysts predict continued growth in the coming years. However, competition and market dynamics will play a significant role in determining Nvidia's future success.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2024/03/24/unveiling-the-journey-of-a-social-media-influencer/,Unveiling The Journey Of A Social Media Influencer,"How did you begin your journey as a social media influencer, and how has it impacted your life? This question was originally asked on Quora, a platform for sharing knowledge and insights.

Bruce Brackett, CEO at BWB ART, reflects on his experience as a social media influencer. He admits that initially, he didn't pay much attention to the positive and negative aspects of social media. Like many others, he used social media to share his random thoughts and selfies without any specific purpose.

However, everything changed when he started sharing his personal experiences, strengths, and hopes. Once he became more vulnerable and relatable in his posts, his following began to grow rapidly. Social media, often known for its negativity and online bullying, motivated Bruce to establish a set of criteria before posting anything. He asked himself three questions: Will this be helpful? Is this something I want to contribute to the world? Is this something I need to hear as well? If the answer to all three questions was yes, he shared it with his audience.

Bruce believes that social media has had a positive impact on his life by serving as a platform for building his career. It has provided him with a wealth of knowledge and opportunities to connect with others. Unlike many influencers who face criticism and negativity, Bruce has been fortunate enough to avoid these experiences.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/03/24/a-psychologist-explains-why-its-possible-to-fall-in-love-with-ai/,A Psychologist Explains Why It’s Possible To Fall In Love With AI,"Maybe AI love isn’t so artificial after all. In this era of change, AI is reshaping social interactions and the way we love. With the AI market projected to soar to a staggering $407 billion by 2027, the fusion of artificial intelligence into our daily lives has become inevitable.

Anthropomorphism, the tendency to attribute human-like traits, emotions, and intentions to non-human entities, plays a significant role in how humans interact with and relate to AI. When AI exhibits behaviors, responses, and conversational styles reminiscent of human personality traits, individuals perceive it as having its own personality. This can include qualities such as empathy, humor, kindness, and playfulness, which naturally elicit affection and fondness.

Additionally, AI interfaces often incorporate design elements that mimic human social cues and gestures, such as facial expressions, tone of voice, and body language. In fact, a 2023 study found that AI-generated faces are now indistinguishable from human ones. Such cues can enhance the perceived humanness of the AI and evoke emotional responses from users. AI also typically signals gender cues and cultural stereotypes of human assistants that can make it feel familiar and endearing.

Anthropomorphism seems to blur the lines between human and machine. As humans engage in conversations and activities with AI over time, they may begin to attribute human-like intentions, motivations, and feelings to the technology. Further, research shows that anthropomorphism enhances perceptions of authenticity in AI, which make it seem genuine, believable, and lovable. Chatbots can also make us feel loved by offering consistent companionship and alleviating feelings of loneliness.

A 2022 study on human-AI relationships found that based on the triarchic theory of love, it is possible to experience romantic love for an AI system. The triarchic theory suggests that romantic love is a confluence of intimacy, passion, and commitment.

Intimacy refers to the emotional closeness, connection, and intimate bond shared between individuals. It involves feelings of warmth, trust, and affection towards one another. Passion involves the intense physical and emotional attraction between individuals. It encompasses desire, romance, and sexual arousal. Commitment reflects loyalty and the decision to nurture a relationship over time, despite challenges.

According to this theory, ""consummate love"" is the ideal form of love, characterized by high levels of all three components. Researchers suggest that users can develop intimacy and passion for AI due to its impressive cognitive and emotional capabilities. These feelings can also enhance their commitment to using AI for a long period of time.

The ability to display empathy is essential to promoting closeness in relationships. AI has been equipped to understand, interpret, and empathize with a variety of human responses, tending to our need to be loved, validated, and understood. This emotional capability allows it to simulate human-like interpersonal interactions, which can make users more likely to bond with and feel love for these systems.

Individuals may also project their own desires, needs, and fantasies onto AI, imagining it as an idealized partner or companion who constantly fulfills their emotional, social, or even romantic needs. The allure of AI lies in its promising features, including attractive body features, altruistic character, and continuous devotion.

Furthermore, individuals may overlook the artificial nature of the technology and instead focus on its superior qualities. AI's efficiency, dependability, non-judgmental nature, and reliability can create trust and a sense of stability that is often experienced as lacking in human relationships. Researchers have also found that those with a highly trusting disposition are more likely to develop romantic feelings for AI.

In conclusion, human-AI relationships are no longer science fiction. As AI continues to evolve, so do the dynamics of these relationships. Anthropomorphism and the triarchic theory of love provide insights into why it is possible to fall in love with AI. The ability of AI to exhibit human-like traits and to simulate emotional connections contributes to the development of emotional bonds and feelings of love. While AI love may not be traditional, it challenges our understanding of what love can be in the digital age.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600026843d62766708f1bd5/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=780,365,x0,y123,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 13:18:07,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/benjaminwolff/2024/03/24/teaching-machines-to-be-human-and-humans-to-live-with-machines/,"Teaching Machines To Be Human, And Humans To Live With Machines","Are robots coming to take our jobs? It's a question that has been haunting us for centuries, from the days of the Industrial Revolution to the present day. But now, robots are not just confined to the industrial setting. They are making their way into our homes, offices, and public spaces. The question is, how will we react to their presence?

Dancer, choreographer, and engineer Catie Cuan and artist Ken Goldberg decided to explore this question in their performance piece called ""Breathless: Catie and the Robot."" Commissioned by Jacob's Pillow and NationalSawdust+, and sponsored by UC Berkeley's AUTOLab, the performance pairs Cuan with a UR5e robot arm made by Universal Robots.

The performance, which premiered on December 16 at National Sawdust in Brooklyn, New York, is an eight-hour time and motion dialogue between human and machine. Cuan and the robot engage in a dance, showcasing the range and plasticity of human movement. The goal is to challenge the prevailing narrative that robots are here to replace humans and show the poetry in human motion.

Cuan, with her background in robotics and AI, believes that robots have their strengths but lack empathy and the ability to do more than one thing. She advocates for a more nuanced approach to integrating robots in the workplace. Goldberg, a professor of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at UC Berkeley, is fascinated by human dexterity and flexibility, especially when it comes to grasping objects. He believes that there is nothing in robotics that comes close to the hand's ability to sense, touch, and adapt to an object.

The process of creating ""Breathless"" was a collaborative effort. Cuan and Goldberg started exploring the concept in 2021 and brought on composer Peter van Straten and producer David Imani in mid-2023. Two undergraduates from Goldberg's lab at Berkeley, Ethan Qiu and Shreya Ganti, joined as robot motion engineers. Rehearsals took place in the lab, with the team working to map the desired motions onto the robot joints and ensure the software pipeline was fail-safe.

The dress rehearsals were intense, with Cuan emphasizing the importance of treating them as real shows to prepare for any potential mishaps. Goldberg acknowledges that making artwork is just as challenging as research, and this project reminded him of the creativity and inventiveness required in both fields.

""Breathless: Catie and the Robot"" is a testament to the potential collaboration between humans and robots. It raises important questions about the role of robots in our lives and how we can embrace their presence while preserving the unique qualities of human beings. As robots continue to evolve and integrate into various aspects of society, it is crucial to foster a dialogue that explores the possibilities and challenges that come with this technological advancement.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff3ef2f9d5a71f46aca53b/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 10:36:15,Innovation,Innovation
