Welcome back, fellow word game enthusiasts! Today, we delve into the mysterious world of Strands, a captivating puzzle brought to you by The New York Times. As I sit here pondering the peculiarities of this game, I can't help but wonder what we should call ourselves. ""The Stranded"" seems a bit melancholic, don't you think? Let's table that for now and focus on unraveling the secrets of today's puzzle.

For those unfamiliar with Strands, it is a clever twist on the classic word search. Currently in beta, this game's fate rests in the hands of dedicated players like us. Each day presents a new challenge, a six by eight grid filled with letters. The objective is to identify a group of words that share a common theme. Fortunately, the game provides a clue to guide us towards this theme. When you successfully identify a theme word, it will be highlighted in a soothing shade of blue.

But wait, there's more! Within this web of letters, you must also uncover a special word known as the spangram. This elusive word connects opposite sides of the board. While the theme words are never proper names, the spangram has no such restriction. Once found, it will shine brightly in a golden hue.

Now, let us turn our attention to today's Strands puzzle. Before we reveal the answers, let's take a moment to appreciate the hint provided. Today's theme revolves around ""Sign language."" Intriguing, isn't it? To further assist you on your quest, here's another clue: ""Constellation.""

And now, the moment you've been waiting for, the answers to today's Strands puzzle:

Spangram: ASTROLOGY

Now, let's locate the spangram on the grid:

Once you uncover the spangram, the remaining words usually fall into place. However, today's puzzle proved to be quite the challenge. I, too, found myself stumped by a few of these words. Let's take a look at the complete list:

- Bull
- Goat
- Scorpion
- Virgin
- Archer
- Scales
- Twins

[Insert Screenshot of Today's Strands Answers]

Today's puzzle truly tested my wits. I must admit, I even resorted to a couple of hints, which unfortunately didn't provide much relief. Initially, I stumbled upon ""Bull"" and ""Goat,"" which only left me more perplexed. I assumed we were searching for animals, completely disregarding any connection to sign language. I even tried ""Stop,"" but to no avail. Sometimes, we must think outside the box to find the answers we seek.

It wasn't until I discovered ""Virgin"" that a glimmer of understanding emerged. As I pondered words beginning with ""OLOGY,"" it suddenly clicked: astrology! That revelation shed light on the previous words. They were all constellations! I swiftly uncovered ""Archer,"" followed by ""Twins,"" and finally, ""Scorpion,"" which gave me quite the run for my money.

On a completely unrelated note, I recently rewatched the film Taxi Driver after many years, and it struck me as peculiarly coincidental. During a breakfast scene between Travis (Robert DeNiro) and Iris (Jodie Foster), she delves into a discussion about astrological signs. Oh, the serendipity of life!

In the end, all's well that ends well. How did you fare in today's Strands puzzle? I'm eager to hear about your triumphs and tribulations. Share your experiences with me on Twitter and Facebook.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2024/03/24/playstation-plus-free-games-for-april-2024-predictions-rumors-leaks-release-date-and-more/,"PlayStation Plus Free Games For April 2024: Predictions, Rumors, Leaks, Release Date And More","As we approach the end of March and eagerly await the announcement of next month's PlayStation Plus lineup, let's take a moment to reflect on the current offerings and speculate on what April might bring. But before we dive into the predictions, let's first understand what PlayStation Plus is and how much it costs.

PlayStation Plus is Sony's monthly membership program that grants access to online gaming. It's important to note that this subscription is not required for streaming movies or TV shows on platforms like Netflix or for playing free-to-play games such as Warzone or Fortnite. However, any paid online games do require a PlayStation Plus subscription.

There are three tiers available for PlayStation Plus: Essential, Extra, and Premium. For the purpose of this discussion, we will focus on the free monthly games offered with the Essential tier. Following a recent price increase, the cost of the tiers are as follows: PS Plus Essential — $79.99/year; PS Plus Extra — $134.99/year; PS Plus Premium — $159.99/year.

Now that we're aware of the basics, let's move on to the exciting part—the upcoming games for April. Sony typically reveals the following month's games on the last Wednesday of the month, with the new lineup becoming available on the first Tuesday of that month. Therefore, we can expect an announcement for April's lineup on the morning of Wednesday, March 27th, and the new games will be available on Tuesday, April 2nd.

As of now, there haven't been any leaks or rumors about the April lineup. However, I have compiled a list of predictions, although some of them may be more wishful thinking than anything else. It's worth noting that since there are no games releasing on April 2nd, we can safely assume that the lineup won't feature any new releases. Additionally, it's possible that we might see a Simulator or sports game included.

Without further ado, here are some of the predictions and wishful thinking titles for April's PlayStation Plus lineup:

1. Assassin's Creed Valhalla: Embark on a Viking adventure in this highly acclaimed open-world action RPG.

2. Need For Speed Unbound: Take to the streets and experience the thrill of high-speed racing in this popular racing franchise.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/24/meet-the-apps-that-tell-you-when-to-take-your-eclipse-glasses-off/,Meet The Apps That Tell You When To Take Your Eclipse Glasses Off,"When it comes to knowing when to remove your solar eclipse glasses, it can be a bit confusing. There are a few factors to consider in order to experience this dynamic event properly. First, you need to be within the path of totality, which is a narrow strip only 115 miles wide. Secondly, you have to find a location with a clear sky. And finally, you must remove your eclipse glasses at the right time to witness the sun's majestic corona.

For many people, it's the last step that causes panic. But fear not, it's actually quite simple. You remove your eclipse glasses when it gets dark. If you are in the path of totality, the darkness will come swiftly as the moon's shadow passes over. It's a moment that you won't miss. However, if you are not in the path of totality, it will not get dark, so you should continue to use your glasses.

Now, there are some smartphone apps available that can enhance your eclipse viewing experience. These apps provide an immersive audio guide that instructs you when to take off your eclipse glasses as totality begins. They also guide you through various phenomena to look out for, such as shadow bands, Baily's beads, and the diamond ring effect. Some of these apps even offer real-time weather updates, cloud forecasts, and countdown timers with vibration alerts to ensure you safely remove your glasses.

One such app is the Eclipse Company's ""Pro"" version. This app not only provides all the necessary information about local eclipse events, but it also alerts you when to look for specific eclipse phenomena. Another popular app is the Solar Eclipse Timer, developed by eclipse chaser and educator Gordon Telepun. This app geolocates your position, confirms if you're in the path of totality, and guides you through the contact times and phenomena. It even has a special mode for photographers, developed with the help of ex-NASA eclipse calculator and photographer Fred Espenak.

If you're an iOS user, you can also check out OneEclipse, created by the non-profit Astronomers Without Borders and Simulation Curriculum. This app not only allows you to simulate the eclipse from your location or anywhere on Earth, but it also supports an eclipse glasses recycling program for underserved communities worldwide. It provides an interactive map with precise eclipse event times and a dynamic Eclipse Countdown clock with a simple audio timer for each phase of the eclipse.

So, with these apps at your fingertips, you can have a more immersive and informative eclipse experience. Just make sure to choose the one that suits your needs and enjoy the awe-inspiring event. Remember to always prioritize safety and protect your eyes while observing solar eclipses.

What makes these offers special is that Samsung accepts smartphones in any condition, even if they have broken displays or poor battery life.

In the U.K., customers can save $126 (£100) on the purchase price of the new Samsung phone by trading in any smartphone, regardless of its condition. The website states that customers can save up to £370 by trading in phones from various brands such as Samsung, Apple, Google, and Huawei. The discount amounts vary depending on the model of the old phone. For example, a Google Pixel 7 Pro can earn a discount of £270, an Apple iPhone 14 can receive £300 off, and a Samsung Galaxy S23 can get £320 off. These discounts represent significant price cuts for customers.

To take advantage of the trade-in offer, customers need to determine the value of their old device and apply for the discount when purchasing the new phone. They will need to provide the IMEI number and current condition of the old device. After purchasing the new phone, customers should wipe the old device, remove the SIM card, and send it back to Samsung within seven days using the provided freepost packaging. It's important to note that failure to send the trade-in device may result in the purchased phone being blocked. Customers can find the U.K. trade-in offers on Samsung's official website.

In the U.S., Samsung is also offering trade-in deals with even more tempting discounts. For example, customers can receive a $450 discount on a new Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra by trading in a Galaxy S23 Ultra. Currently, this discount has been increased by $300 to a total of $750. Similarly, trading in a Galaxy Z Fold5 can earn customers a $750 discount on the new Ultra, an increase from the previous $500 discount. Customers who switch from Apple to Samsung can save $750 on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra by trading in an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max. Previously, the discounts for these models would have been $520 and $540, respectively. Additionally, customers trading in smartphones from other Android brands can receive a $100 discount. However, in the U.S., the trade-in device must be in good condition, meaning it should turn on, have a functioning screen and charging port, hold a charge, have no cracks in the front, back, screen, or camera lenses, have disabled activation locks, removed accounts, and be factory reset. The device should also not be on a banned list. These specific requirements ensure that the device is in a suitable condition for trade-in. Customers can find the U.S. trade-in offers on Samsung's official website.

These trade-in offers from Samsung provide customers with an opportunity to upgrade to the latest Galaxy phones at more affordable prices. Whether in the U.K. or the U.S., customers can take advantage of these promotions to trade in their old smartphones and receive significant discounts on the purchase of the new devices. It's a great way to save money while enjoying the features and capabilities of Samsung's latest handsets.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600943ad1dab534d4dfdb70/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=720,479,x0,y0,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 17:08:19,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/24/see-the-moon-eclipsed-by-earth-as-americas-total-solar-eclipse-draws-near-the-night-sky-this-week/,See The Moon Begin Its ‘Eclipse Season:’ The Night Sky This Week,"The Night Sky This Week: March 25-31, 2024

North America is currently experiencing a golden age of eclipses, and this week marks an important moment leading up to a major event next week. In the early hours of Monday, March 25, the full worm moon will be partially eclipsed by Earth, creating a penumbral lunar eclipse. While it may not be a full ""blood moon"" total lunar eclipse, this event is significant because it sets the stage for a total solar eclipse on Monday, April 8, 2024. If you don't want to miss out on this incredible phenomenon, here are some planning tips to keep in mind.

In addition to the eclipse, there are other celestial highlights to look out for this week. As the week progresses, the waning gibbous moon will pass close to a couple of bright stars, making it perfect for stargazing in the early evening skies by the weekend.

Let's dive into the details of what you can expect to see in the night sky this week:

Monday, March 25: 'Worm Moon Lunar Eclipse'

On Monday, March 25, the third full moon of 2024, known as the ""Worm Moon,"" will pass through Earth's outer shadow in space, resulting in a slight penumbral lunar eclipse. This eclipse will be visible from North and South America, Europe, East Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. In New York, the eclipse will begin at 00:53 a.m. EDT and end at 05:32 a.m. EDT, with the maximum eclipse occurring at 03:12 a.m. EDT. In Los Angeles, the eclipse will start at 9:53 p.m. PDT on Sunday, March 24, and end at 02:32 a.m. PDT on Monday, March 25, with the maximum eclipse at 00:12 a.m. EDT.

Tuesday, March 26: Moon And Spica

On Tuesday, after sunset, take a moment to look towards the east and witness the almost full moon rising. What makes this moonrise special is the presence of the bright star Spica, located just to the top right of the moon. Spica is the brightest star in the constellation Virgo and one of the 20 brightest stars in the night sky. It will be within 1.4 degrees of the moon, creating a captivating sight.

Saturday, March 30: Moon And Antares

Late on Friday into the early hours of Saturday, direct your gaze towards the southeast to catch a glimpse of a 78%-lit waning gibbous moon. It will be less than a degree away from Antares, a red supergiant star in the constellation Scorpius. This celestial pairing is sure to capture your attention.

Galaxies Of The Week: Bode's And The Cigar

This week, Ursa Minor and Ursa Major, visible in the northern sky after dark, offer a treat for stargazers equipped with an 8-inch telescope. Look out for M81, also known as Bode's galaxy, and M82, known as the Cigar galaxy. M81 is a large spiral galaxy located approximately 12 million light-years from Earth, making it one of the brightest galaxies in the night sky. On the other hand, M82 is a starburst galaxy, also about 12 million light-years away, and is known for its high rate of star formation. Both galaxies can be observed in the same field of view as small, diffuse patches of light northwest of the bright star Dubhe in the Big Dipper.

Eclipse Tip Of The Week: Preparing For The Total Solar Eclipse

Less than two weeks from now, North America will witness a rare and breathtaking celestial event—a total solar eclipse. If you haven't made plans yet, it's time to act. Keep in mind that merely getting close to the path of totality won't provide the same experience as being directly within it. To make the most of this event, consult the plethora of articles available or visit websites that offer maps, simulations, and event listings. It's essential to plan your stay and determine the best location to witness the eclipse.

For the most accurate and location-specific information, consider using online planetariums like Stellarium and The Sky Live. These tools provide details about planet-rise/planet-set, sunrise/sunset, and moonrise/moonset times based on your location.

With clear skies and wide eyes, I wish you a memorable week of stargazing and astronomical wonders.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/5fb7fc7c1bbcea1ee676a031/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2390,1121,x1617,y1192,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 20:15:00,Innovation,Innovation
