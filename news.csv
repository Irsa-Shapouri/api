Today's Wordle Etymology
The word ""towel"" has a rich history, originating from the Old French ""touaille"" and evolving into the English ""towel"" in the 13th century. This linguistic evolution showcases the influence of Norman French on the English language post-Norman Conquest.

Towels have been essential in households for centuries, adapting in material and use but maintaining their core purpose of drying or wiping. The transition from ""touaille"" to ""towel"" reflects the linguistic changes over time.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/apple-sued-microsofts-ai-ambitions-and-nvidia-surprises/,"Apple sued, Microsoft's AI ambitions and Nvidia's surprises","Welcome to this edition of Week in Review, where we bring you the latest updates on Apple's antitrust lawsuit and Microsoft's AI ambitions. Let's dive right in.

The U.S. has joined international regulators in accusing Apple of using monopolistic tactics to lock in iPhone users. In response, Apple claims that the actions taken by the Department of Justice (DOJ) could ruin what its users enjoy about its phones and ecosystem.

While the DOJ's lawsuit draws a connection between Apple and Microsoft in the 1990s, there are significant differences between the two companies and their efforts to retain customers.

However, experts predict that not much will come out of the lawsuit in the short-term. It could take three to five years for the lawsuit to reach a resolution.

Now, let's move on to other news.

Microsoft recently acquired the co-founders of the high-profile AI startup, Inflection AI. Mustafa Suleyman will now lead Microsoft AI's consumer-facing unit, while Karén Simonyan becomes the EVP and CEO of the same group. This acquisition comes after Inflection raised $1.3 billion, with Microsoft being the biggest investor.

At Nvidia's GTC event, CEO Jensen Huang made several surprising announcements. He predicted that artificial general intelligence would be achievable within five years. Additionally, he shared news about a new AI platform called GR00T, designed for humanoid robots.

Google and Apple are reportedly in talks that could lead to Google's AI model being deployed to power upcoming iOS updates. It remains unclear whether this will be a temporary solution until Apple's own AI efforts are up to speed, a long-standing partnership, or a negotiation that may not reach a resolution.

Moving on to hacking and privacy news.

The Biden administration is forming an international coalition to combat commercial spyware. Interestingly, some investors who are now part of this coalition were previously involved in the same business they are now fighting against.

In the gaming community, a hack brought an Apex Legends tournament to a halt. The hacker claimed to have done it for fun and to highlight the exploit used.

Glassdoor users are reporting that their real names are being added to their profiles without their consent. The only solution provided to them is to delete their accounts entirely.

Let's now take a look at funding and IPOs.

Reddit's IPO had a strong start, with the stock jumping 48% on its first day and closing at $46 after market hours on Friday. This is a significant success for the company.

Astera Labs, a company that produces connectivity hardware for cloud computing data centers, saw a 72% increase on its first day of trading. The company's revenue grew by 45% to $115.8 million last year.

The Browser Company, behind the Arc browser, raised $50 million at a $550 million valuation. The company has an ambitious goal of supplanting PCs with browsers, but its path to monetization remains unclear.

In our bonus round, we discuss AI's struggle with spelling and the challenges of reviewing systems like ChatGPT and Gemini.

Despite its massive potential, AI still has trouble spelling simple words like ""burrito"" in generated images.

Fisker, an EV company, has paused production due to a lack of funds. If they are unable to raise more capital, they may have to cease operations altogether.

In conclusion, while Apple faces an antitrust lawsuit and Microsoft makes moves in the AI industry, other companies like Reddit and Astera Labs enjoy successful IPOs. Hacking incidents and privacy concerns continue to make headlines, and the challenges of AI are explored further.

That's all for this edition of Week in Review. Stay tuned for more updates in the coming weeks.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/apple-antitrust-doj-splash.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-23 20:15:37,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianmazique/2024/03/23/ufcs-dana-white-cuts-fighter-immediately-after-he-bit-an-opponent/,UFC’s Dana White Cuts Fighter Immediately After He Bit An Opponent,"Pressure and combat sports can bring out the worst in people, as we saw on Saturday night at UFC Fight Night: Ribas vs. Namajunas. In a shocking turn of events, Igor Severino, in his UFC debut, bit his opponent, Andre Lima, during the second round of their preliminary bout.

The bite, which was clearly visible in images showing bite marks, occurred while Severino had Lima in a standing grappling position. This unsportsmanlike action resulted in Severino's disqualification and raised serious questions about his future in the promotion.

Severino, only 20 years old, had the opportunity to make a name for himself in the UFC. However, his actions on Saturday night will undoubtedly make it difficult for him to earn the trust and respect of both the promotion and the fans.

With this loss, Severino's previously unblemished record now stands at 9-1, while Lima remains undefeated at 8-0. UFC CEO Dana White wasted no time in making the decision to cut Severino from the roster. ""Those were two up-and-coming undefeated fighters,"" White stated. ""If you're frustrated and want out of the fight, there are plenty of ways to do it, but biting your opponent is the worst thing you can do. Now, Severino not only loses the biggest opportunity of his life but also faces potential consequences from the Nevada State Athletic Commission.""

Biting incidents in combat sports are not unheard of, but they are always met with strong condemnation. In this case, Lima handled the situation with remarkable composure, calmly informing the referee about the bite and initiating a brief investigation into the incident.

For Severino, the road to redemption is long. He will need to rebuild his reputation by competing in smaller promotions before he can even dream of returning to the UFC, the Professional Fighters League, or any other respected mixed martial arts organization.

As Saturday's events in Las Vegas conclude, stay tuned for more traditional fight results. The world of combat sports is always full of surprises, both positive and negative, and it's important to celebrate the victories while holding the athletes accountable for their actions.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff92c285143669667fa59c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3188,1794,x0,y217,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-23 22:45:24,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2024/03/23/the-invisible-shield-aims-to-makes-public-health-more-visible/,‘The Invisible Shield’ Aims To Makes Public Health More Visible,"There's a popular saying that offensive linemen in football don't receive much recognition unless they make a mistake and get penalized. The same can be said for public health. That's why a new TV series called The Invisible Shield aims to shed light on the importance of public health. This four-episode series will debut on PBS on March 26 at 10 pm, and it has the potential to bring visibility to the crucial role of public health in our lives.

The title ""The Invisible Shield"" reflects the fact that the public health system and its professionals work tirelessly to protect us from various health threats. However, this vital work often goes unnoticed amidst the noise of celebrity gossip, political debates, and unnecessary product promotions. As Kelly Henning, MD, the Public Health Program Lead for Bloomberg Philanthropies, explains in the first episode, ""The better public health works, the less likely you are to see it."" Sadly, this ""invisible shield"" has been deteriorating for years, and most people are unaware of it because the public health system remains largely invisible to them.

The Covid-19 pandemic should have exposed the chronic underfunding, underappreciation, and vulnerability of our public health systems once and for all. If the public health system had received more resources and support to combat the SARS-CoV-2 virus, countless lives could have been saved, and much suffering could have been prevented. Unfortunately, political and business leaders only briefly acknowledged this before returning to their own self-interests.

In fact, some leaders worsened the situation by spreading misinformation and disinformation about public health. While the pandemic temporarily brought public health into the spotlight, the necessary resources did not follow suit. So, what will it take for everyone to realize that the public health system desperately needs more support? Must we wait for a disaster even more catastrophic than the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent collapse of the public health system? That would be like waiting for our building to burn down before considering installing smoke alarms, fire extinguishers, and sprinklers.

To prevent further disasters, RadicalMedia produced The Invisible Shield with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies. The goal is to bring attention to public health. In a world where celebrities, influencers, politicians, and businesses constantly promote themselves and their products, public health often gets drowned out. Consequently, people underestimate the significant impact public health has had on their lives. Think about it. Without public health achievements like vaccinations, antibiotics, clean water supplies, and anti-pollution efforts, would you even be alive today to buy into the hype and products? As Josh Sharfstein, MD, Distinguished Professor of the Practice at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, states in the trailer for The Invisible Shield, ""Public health saved your life today, but you didn't even know it.""

Of course, four episodes cannot fully capture the comprehensive contributions of public health throughout history. Even Zack Snyder's 2021 Justice League movie, which lasted four hours and two minutes (although it felt like six hours), may not have made any real impact on your life. The first episode of The Invisible Shield, titled ""The Old Playbook,"" will explore how public health has doubled life expectancy since 1900. It will also highlight the current risks and challenges facing the public health system. This includes examining how the system applied lessons from previous epidemics and pandemics to address the Covid-19 crisis. But more on that later.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/23/explained-the-difference-between-a-solar-eclipse-and-a-lunar-eclipse/,Explained: The Difference Between A Solar Eclipse And A Lunar Eclipse,"Do you know the difference between a solar eclipse and a lunar eclipse? In the next few weeks, we will witness two magnificent celestial events—a lunar eclipse on March 25 and a solar eclipse on April 8. Although they are distinct phenomena, they are both caused by the same alignment of celestial bodies.

A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth's shadow is cast upon the moon, while a solar eclipse happens when the moon obstructs the sun's light, creating a shadow on Earth. However, these eclipses are relatively rare due to the subtle differences in the orbital planes of the Earth and the moon around the sun.

What exactly causes a lunar eclipse? This phenomenon can only occur during a full moon, when the Earth is positioned between the sun and the moon, projecting a shadow into space. While full moons happen every 29 days, it is uncommon for the moon to pass through Earth's shadow. When it does, we witness a lunar eclipse.

On the other hand, a solar eclipse can only take place during a new moon when the moon is situated between the sun and the Earth, casting a shadow onto our planet. New moons occur every 29 days, approximately two weeks after a full moon. However, it is rare for the moon to align perfectly with the sun as seen from Earth. When this alignment occurs, a solar eclipse transpires.

What causes a total lunar eclipse? It requires a flawless alignment of the sun, Earth, and moon. Earth possesses two shadows—the outer penumbral shadow and the inner umbral shadow. When a full moon enters Earth's umbral shadow, it receives no direct sunlight. Instead, the only light reaching its surface is refracted by Earth's atmosphere, resulting in a mesmerizing spectacle—a ""Blood Moon."" If one were to stand on the moon during a lunar eclipse, they would be bathed in a pinkish-red glow and witness a partial or total solar eclipse.

On March 25, we will observe a penumbral lunar eclipse, as the full ""Worm Moon"" passes through Earth's penumbra.

Now, what causes a total solar eclipse? It also requires a perfect alignment of the sun, moon, and Earth, along with a celestial fluke. A new moon possesses two shadows—the outer penumbral shadow and the inner umbral shadow. When the moon completely obscures the sun—possible due to its size being 400 times smaller than the sun and its proximity to Earth being 400 times closer—an umbra is projected onto our planet.

The moon's shadow moves across the Earth's surface as it orbits from west to east, which coincides with the direction of Earth's rotation. This synchronicity slows down the movement of the moon's shadow, creating a path of totality called the umbral shadow. Those within this path witness an extraordinary event—a total solar eclipse. If you were standing on the moon during a total solar eclipse, you would observe the moon's shadow crossing Earth.

On April 8, a total solar eclipse will occur as the new ""Pink Moon"" perfectly blocks the sun, casting an umbral shadow over North America.

Why are lunar and solar eclipses considered rare occurrences? It is due to the moon's orbit around Earth, which is inclined approximately 5 degrees with respect to the sun's path in the sky. Consequently, the moon's path intersects with the sun twice during each orbit—approximately every month. However, for a solar or lunar eclipse to transpire, the moon must be in its new or full phase. This specific alignment happens twice a year, resulting in two ""eclipse seasons"" when solar and lunar eclipses are more likely. Nevertheless, the majority of solar eclipses are either partial or annular, while most lunar eclipses are penumbral or partial.

Let's take a look at the upcoming lunar and solar eclipses in 2024:
- March 25, 2024: Penumbral lunar eclipse (visible in North America)
- April 8, 2024: Total solar eclipse (visible in North America)
- September 17, 2024: Partial lunar eclipse (visible in North America)
- October 2, 2024: Annular solar eclipse (visible in the Pacific Ocean and South America)

In 2025, we can anticipate two ""eclipse seasons"":
- March 13, 2025: Total lunar eclipse (visible in North America)
- March 29, 2025: Partial solar eclipse (visible in Canada and northern Europe)
- September 7, 2025: Total lunar eclipse (visible in Asia)
- September 21, 2025: Partial solar eclipse (visible in Antarctica)

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/24/debunked-i-think-ive-seen-a-total-solar-eclipse-before/,Debunked: ‘I Think I’ve Seen A Total Solar Eclipse Before’,"Have you ever thought you witnessed a total solar eclipse? Well, according to eclipse chasers, you're most likely mistaken. It's a common misperception among people who have seen a partial solar eclipse, which occurs twice a year across different parts of the world. The truth is, if you've truly experienced totality—when the sun is completely blocked by the moon—you would never forget it. It's a moment that stays with you for a lifetime.

Seeing a total solar eclipse requires some effort. You have to be in the path of totality, the specific area on Earth where the moon fully obscures the sun. If you're outside this path, all you'll witness is a partial solar eclipse. So, if you're unsure whether you've seen a total solar eclipse, eclipse chasers are quick to doubt your claim.

However, there have been significant opportunities to witness total solar eclipses in North America. In fact, the continent is currently experiencing a golden age of eclipses. The most recent one, known as the ""Great American Eclipse,"" took place in 2017, and it brought totality to 12 U.S. states from Oregon to South Carolina. Around 12 million people resided in the path of totality, and another million traveled to be part of this extraordinary event. If you were lucky enough to be on that path, you would remember the breathtaking twilight-like sky, the moon's silhouette, and the incredible sight of the sun's white corona shining all around it. It's an experience that becomes etched in your memory forever.

If you're unsure whether you've witnessed a total solar eclipse, there are ways to verify your memory. Many people believe they saw one during their school or work days, usually involving solar eclipse glasses or pinhole cameras. In most cases, these memories are from 2017 when a partial solar eclipse was visible throughout North America. To be sure, you can use the Solar Eclipses Visibility Database to check the location and date of your memory.

To help you further, here's a list of all the total solar eclipses that have occurred in North America over the past 70 years. Each link will take you to an interactive map that shows the path of totality. If the eclipse you remember isn't listed here, it was most likely a partial solar eclipse.

Next time you come across someone who believes they've seen a total solar eclipse, ask them about the date, location, and their experience of totality. Then, gently inform them about the upcoming once-in-a-lifetime event on April 8, 2024. This total eclipse of the sun will be witnessed by a staggering 42 million people, including 32 million Americans, who already reside in the path of totality.

On April 8, everyone in North America will be able to witness a partial solar eclipse. However, only those within a narrow 115-mile path, spanning parts of Mexico, 15 U.S. states, and Canada, will have the chance to experience totality. The path will cross five states in Mexico, 15 U.S. states, and six Canadian provinces.

The cerebral areas located in the frontal lobe, responsible for attention, organizational skills, and emotional responses, are abnormally active or have a specific anatomy. There is also an imbalance in levels of some chemical messengers in the brain, such as dopamine and noradrenaline.

A recent study involving 221,714 individuals with ADHD revealed that those prescribed ADHD stimulant medications had a lower risk of suicide attempts and psychiatric hospitalizations. Heidi Taipale and her team from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden found that certain ADHD medications, including amphetamine, lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate, were associated with improved outcomes.

While lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate were linked to a decreased risk of suicidal behavior, only lisdexamphetamine showed a reduced risk of psychiatric hospitalizations. The prevalence of psychiatric co-morbidities among individuals with ADHD is significantly higher compared to those without ADHD, with conditions like major depressive disorder, panic disorder, substance abuse, and others being common.

The study also highlighted the increased risk of mortality among individuals with ADHD, especially when co-morbidities like substance use disorder were present. Atomoxetine, another ADHD medication, was not associated with a lower risk of psychiatric hospitalizations or suicidal behavior but showed a link to fewer hospitalizations for non-psychiatric co-morbidities.

The researchers emphasized the overall benefits of ADHD medications in improving psychiatric outcomes, despite potential concerns about adverse effects like increased blood pressure, heart rate, and the risk of cardiovascular diseases. The study, published in JAMA Network Open on March 20, 2024, provided valuable insights into the long-term effectiveness and safety of ADHD pharmacotherapies.

The findings underscored the importance of ADHD medication in managing symptoms and improving quality of life for individuals with ADHD.
