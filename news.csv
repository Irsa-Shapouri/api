In the coming months, viewers will be able to access broadcasts from regional sports networks (RSNs) directly from the ESPN app and website.

Starting this week, NESN subscribers can watch live games of Boston-area sports teams like the Red Sox, Celtics, Patriots, and Bruins on the ESPN site or app. Next month, Monumental Sports Network, which covers Washington D.C.-area teams such as the Capitals, Wizards, and Mystics, will be added. SportsNet Pittsburgh, home to the Penguins, Pirates, and WVU games, has also been confirmed. More RSNs are likely to join in the future.

In recent years, many sports franchises have signed agreements to broadcast their games on regional sports networks. These networks, which typically feature multiple teams from a specific city or region, can be part of a cable package or offered as standalone subscriptions. However, viewers will still need a subscription to these networks to access the games, as the streams will continue to come from the provider websites. The partnership with ESPN simply makes it easier for fans to find and access these games.

For the regional networks, this increased discoverability is significant. If games are easier to find and accessible through an app that viewers already have, they are more likely to subscribe. The goal is to make games more accessible to a wider audience, benefiting both the teams and the fans. No additional charges will be added; it's simply a matter of convenience.

These links to regional games will only be shown to people who live in the coverage areas for those networks. This ensures that viewers will only see options for games they have access to.

This move comes as ESPN recently announced a partnership with Fox and Warner Bros. to create a streaming service that covers almost every major and minor sports league. With these three media giants joining forces, fans will have access to MLB, NFL, NBA, NHL, NCAA football and basketball, NASCAR, PGA Tour, Grand Slam tennis, soccer, and more all in one app.

As the world of streaming becomes more fragmented, ESPN is taking steps to bring together a wide range of sports content into a single platform. By partnering with regional sports networks and offering a comprehensive streaming service, ESPN aims to provide sports fans with a seamless and convenient viewing experience.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/83df13de495fcfec3cffb77378df0e2ad3591ce2/2024/03/25/fd31c575-1031-497a-845f-afbf4b97b11c/pxl-20240325-185459546.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/25/total-eclipse-of-the-chatbot-why-not-to-ask-chatgpt-about-aprils-rare-event/,Total Eclipse Of The Chatbot: Why Not To Ask ChatGPT About Aprilâ€™s Rare Event,"When it comes to the total solar eclipse, finding accurate information can be a challenge, especially with AI chatbots like ChatGPT. While these bots may excel in certain areas, their knowledge of celestial events leaves much to be desired. In fact, their responses can sometimes be inconsistent, biased, and downright wrong.

For example, when I asked ChatGPT about the timing of the next total solar eclipse, it initially provided incorrect information. It claimed that the next one had already occurred on December 14, 2020, in South America. However, the truth is that the upcoming total solar eclipse will take place on April 8, 2024, and will be visible from parts of North America, including Mexico, the United States, and Canada.

Curious about its accuracy, I asked ChatGPT again about the next total solar eclipse after April 8, 2024. This time, it gave a peculiar response, stating that the eclipse would occur on August 23, 2044. While this date does indeed have a total solar eclipse, it is not the next one after April 8, 2024. In fact, between these two dates, there will be a remarkable 13 total solar eclipses. So, it seems that ChatGPT may have an inclination towards events in the contiguous United States.

To further test its knowledge, I asked ChatGPT about the next total solar eclipse after August 23, 2044. Astonishingly, it provided yet another incorrect answer, claiming it would happen on March 20, 2053. The reality is that the next total solar eclipse after August 23, 2044, will occur on August 12, 2045, and it is often referred to as the ""Greatest American Eclipse"" due to its significance. While there is indeed an eclipse on March 20, 2053, it is not a total solar eclipse.

In contrast to ChatGPT's lackluster performance, Gemini, Google's new AI model engine (formerly known as Bard), proves to be much more reliable. When asked about the next total solar eclipse, Gemini consistently provides accurate information, stating that it will occur on April 8, 2024, visible across parts of North America. Furthermore, Gemini even goes the extra mile by informing me that I will be able to witness this celestial spectacle from my own location.

It is disheartening to discover that AI chatbots struggle with providing accurate information about celestial events that have been meticulously calculated for thousands of years into the future. While ChatGPT may be a useful tool for various purposes, it falls short when it comes to satisfying the curiosity of eclipse chasers.

If you are seeking the most up-to-date information on the total solar eclipse, including travel and lodging options, I encourage you to check my main feed regularly for new articles. Let's hope for clear skies and wide eyes as we eagerly anticipate this extraordinary celestial phenomenon.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66016f04433add21d5071fb4/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2004,1128,x10,y411,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 13:00:51,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/techcrunch-mobility-the-wheels-are-starting-to-come-off-the-fisker-ev-bus/,TechCrunch Mobility: The wheels are starting to come off the Fisker EV bus,"Welcome to TechCrunch Mobility, your go-to source for all things transportation. In this edition, we'll be discussing some significant developments in the automotive industry, including the Biden Administration's proposed standards, an interesting investment by Uber, and exciting news from various startups. So let's dive in!

Firstly, let's address the proposed standards recently released by the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These regulations will have a profound impact on U.S. automakers and consumers alike. While the regulations have been somewhat softened to accommodate industry concerns, they still impose stricter standards than before. The DOE's ""petroleum equivalency factor"" provides EVs with a score under the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. The original proposal would have made it challenging for automakers to meet these standards, resulting in hefty fines. On the other hand, the EPA's tailpipe standards for 2027 to 2032 model year vehicles will require automakers to meet stiffer requirements but offer more flexibility in utilizing various powertrains. This technology-agnostic approach allows automakers to meet the rules without entirely transitioning to battery electric vehicles. These standards are also less stringent than the initial proposal, which aimed for 67% EV sales in the U.S. passenger vehicle market by 2032.

While these regulations don't have much impact on EV startups like Rivian, Tesla, and Lucid, they do pose challenges for legacy automakers. These companies are investing billions in developing EVs while still making profits from internal combustion engine vehicles. Interestingly, plug-in hybrids might be the winners in this scenario.

Moving on to the latest news, let's start with Clevon, a company specializing in autonomous delivery technology. Rumors circulated that Clevon was struggling to secure new investments and might shut down. However, the company's co-founder, Sander Sebastian Agur, has confirmed that they are still in operation. Clevon has entered into an exclusivity agreement for a merger with an American electric vehicle company, which should be completed by the first half of June. In the meantime, the company is implementing cost reductions, resulting in layoffs for about 17 employees.

Now, let's talk about Uber's recent investment in an Africa-founded startup. Moove, a mobility fintech company, raised $100 million in a Series B funding round led by Uber. The company provides vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers. This investment aligns with Uber's commitment to achieving a fully zero-emission fleet by 2040, as Moove has made electric vehicles a significant part of its business strategy. The funding round valued Moove at $750 million.

In other notable deals, Amber, a startup that offers aftermarket Tesla extended warranty products, raised $3.18 million in a seed round. Candela, an electric boat maker, secured $25 million in funding, led by Groupe Beneteau. And Pelikan Mobility, a French startup, announced a partnership with Renault to develop a shared mobility platform.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-deep-geothermal-renewable-powerhouse.html,Dig deep: US bets on geothermal to become renewable powerhouse,"Geothermal energy is gaining attention as a potential backbone of the green transition in the United States. Despite currently contributing only a small fraction to the country's energy production, many businesses and the Biden administration are investing in technological advancements to make geothermal energy a key player in the clean energy sector.

During the CERAWeek conference in Houston, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm emphasized the potential of geothermal energy, stating that if the heat beneath our feet can be harnessed effectively, it can provide clean and reliable power for various sectors, from industries to households. The Department of Energy estimates that geothermal energy could surpass hydroelectric and solar power in the US by 2050.

Geothermal energy utilizes the naturally high temperatures beneath the Earth's surface to generate electricity and heat buildings. However, it currently represents only 1.6 percent of US energy consumption. To increase geothermal production, the US government has invested over $200 million in an experimental site in Utah. This site focuses on Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), a technology that involves drilling exceptionally deep wells and injecting water into hot rocks, without the need for nearby hot springs or underground reservoirs.

The implementation of EGS technology offers several advantages. Firstly, it reduces the upfront risk associated with drilling, as geothermal energy can be harnessed almost anywhere. Secondly, the US government is simplifying the conversion of permits for oil or gas exploration into geothermal licenses, reducing paperwork and delays. Additionally, EGS requires fewer chemical additives compared to traditional fracking methods, making it more environmentally friendly. Moreover, geothermal energy provides a continuous flow of power regardless of weather conditions or time of day, unlike solar or wind power.

In terms of cost, the US government predicts a significant drop in the price of geothermal energy. Currently ranging from $70 to $100 per megawatt hour (MWh), it is projected to decrease to $45 by 2035. The use of existing drilling technology makes geothermal energy development faster and more cost-effective. By modifying existing oil and gas drilling models, the industry has achieved a significant breakthrough.

While the US has taken the lead in implementing this new technology, other countries, such as France, also have experimental EGS sites. However, geothermal drilling projects, like fracking, can potentially induce seismic activity, which raises concerns. The US Energy Department requires all funded projects to follow a mitigation protocol to address induced seismicity and is actively funding research on the issue.

Despite the challenges, several start-ups in the US and Canada have secured substantial investments and are competing in the geothermal energy market. These companies have raised hundreds of millions of dollars and are driving the growth of the industry. For example, Fervo Energy, in collaboration with Google, has successfully connected its Nevada site to the electric grid. This project, although currently generating only 3.5 megawatts, demonstrates the increasing demand for geothermal energy. Major companies like Google, Microsoft, and Nucor have announced their plans to purchase geothermal energy, signaling the potential for a thriving market.

As the geothermal energy sector continues to expand, the need for a first successful commercial facility becomes crucial. Once one company demonstrates the feasibility and profitability of geothermal energy, others are likely to follow suit. With the industry still in its early stages, the primary objective is to ensure sustainable growth for the long term.

Geothermal energy presents a promising solution to meet the growing demand for clean and reliable power. With ongoing investments and advancements in technology, it has the potential to play a significant role in the transition to a greener future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/a-worker-operates-a-dr.jpg,2024-03-25 04:59:03,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2024/03/25/amid-fintech-slowdown-goldman-sachs-backed-startup-considers-sale-sources-say/,"Amid Fintech Slowdown, Goldman Sachs-Backed Startup Considers Sale","Deserve, a 10-year-old Silicon Valley startup that assists other companies in launching and managing credit cards, is facing challenges due to a slowdown in business and a dry funding market. The company, which is backed by high-profile investors including Goldman Sachs, Visa, Mastercard, and Accel, has been exploring options to sell itself and has attracted interest from larger businesses. However, Deserve's founder and CEO, Kalpesh Kapadia, has stated that the company is not for sale but is open to strategic discussions around partnerships, investments, and mergers. Deserve, which has raised $150 million in equity funding since its founding in 2013, is not yet profitable and burned through $15 million to $20 million in 2023. Kapadia is optimistic about the company's growth prospects for this year and expects to reduce its burn rate while achieving renewed growth and profitability.

Industry insiders believe that if Deserve is sold, it will likely fetch less than its peak valuation in 2021. The fintech industry has seen a decline in valuations, and Deserve faced additional challenges when its largest customer, crypto lender BlockFi, went bankrupt. Deserve had been looking to grow by partnering with crypto lenders that wanted to issue credit cards, but the collapse of BlockFi had a significant impact on the company's revenue.

Kapadia, originally from India, came to the United States in the mid-1990s for graduate studies. He founded Deserve after working in finance for 15 years, aiming to create a consumer credit card company that would cater to immigrants and students. However, consumer lending proved to be a difficult and capital-intensive business, especially when taking on the financial risk alone. In 2018, Deserve shifted its business model to help other companies launch credit cards after being approached by student loan bank Sallie Mae. Deserve now handles various aspects of launching and managing credit cards, including risk assessment, transaction processing, customer service, and dispute resolution.

Deserve has worked with a range of customers, from small fintech startups to larger institutions like the University of Notre Dame. The company's pivot allowed it to diversify its customer base and revenue streams. However, the collapse of BlockFi and the struggles faced by other fintech customers have had an impact on Deserve's business. As interest rates rise and the startup funding market becomes more challenging, the company has faced difficulties.

Competition in the tech-enabled credit card issuing space has increased over the past year. Deserve currently has 15 customers, including fintech companies like M1 and banks like Customers Bank. Despite the challenges it faces, Deserve remains committed to its mission of providing financial infrastructure and powering card programs for companies and banks. The company aims to build a self-sustaining and profitable business by reducing its burn rate, achieving renewed growth, and leveraging its sales pipeline.

In conclusion, Deserve, a Silicon Valley startup specializing in assisting companies with credit card launches, is navigating a challenging business environment. Despite facing slowdowns and funding difficulties, the company remains committed to its vision and is exploring strategic partnerships and investment opportunities. Deserve's founder and CEO, Kalpesh Kapadia, is optimistic about the company's potential for growth and profitability. While the company may face valuation challenges if it decides to sell, it continues to innovate and adapt to a changing market.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600d053afe6bed0f9b925c9/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 11:57:06,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-large-language-simple-mechanism-knowledge.html,Large language models use a surprisingly simple mechanism to retrieve some stored knowledge,"Large language models, such as ChatGPT, are incredibly complex and widely used in various fields. However, scientists still have limited understanding of how these models work. To gain insight into their mechanisms, researchers at MIT and other institutions conducted a study on how these models retrieve and decode stored knowledge.

Surprisingly, the researchers discovered that large language models often employ a simple linear function to recover and decode facts. These linear functions, which involve two variables and no exponents, capture the straightforward relationship between variables. The model uses the same decoding function for similar types of facts, allowing researchers to identify and locate stored knowledge within the model.

Using a technique they developed, the researchers were able to estimate these simple functions. They found that even when a model provides an incorrect answer, it often retains the correct information. This approach could potentially be used to identify and correct falsehoods within the model, reducing the occurrence of incorrect or nonsensical answers.

Evan Hernandez, an electrical engineering and computer science graduate student at MIT and co-lead author of the research paper, highlights the significance of this finding. Despite the complexity of these models, there are sometimes simple mechanisms at work inside them, as demonstrated by the presence of linear functions.

The paper was written by Hernandez and co-lead author Arnab Sharma, a computer science graduate student at Northeastern University, along with their advisors and collaborators from MIT, Harvard University, and the Israeli Institute of Technology. The research findings will be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024).

Most large language models, including transformer models, are neural networks consisting of interconnected nodes that process and encode data. These models store knowledge as relations connecting subjects and objects. For example, the relation ""Miles Davis plays the trumpet"" connects the subject (Miles Davis) to the object (trumpet).

As the model acquires more knowledge, it stores additional facts related to a subject across its layers. When a user asks a question about a specific subject, the model needs to retrieve the most relevant fact to provide an accurate response.

The researchers conducted a series of experiments to investigate how large language models decode relational information. Despite their complexity, the models were found to utilize a simple linear function for decoding. Each decoding function is specific to the type of fact being retrieved. For example, the model uses one decoding function to output the instrument a person plays and another function to output the state where a person was born.

To estimate these simple functions, the researchers developed a method and computed functions for 47 different relations. These relations include examples such as ""capital city of a country"" and ""lead singer of a band."" The chosen subset of relations represents the types of facts that can be decoded using linear functions.

The researchers tested each function by changing the subject and verifying if it correctly recovered the associated object information. Their findings suggest that linear functions play a crucial role in the model's ability to retrieve and decode facts accurately.

In conclusion, this study sheds light on the inner workings of large language models. Despite their complexity, these models often rely on simple linear functions to retrieve and decode stored knowledge. This understanding could potentially be used to identify and correct inaccuracies within the models, improving their overall performance. Further research in this area could lead to advancements in the field of artificial intelligence and language processing.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/large-language-models-2.jpg,2024-03-25 09:34:06,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/lucid-motors-1-billion-saudi-arabia-gravity-suv/,Lucid Motors raises another $1 billion from Saudi Arabia as it searches for luxury EV buyers,"Lucid Motors, the luxury electric sedan manufacturer, has secured an additional $1 billion in funding from its largest investor, Saudi Arabia. Ayar Third Investment, an affiliate of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, has agreed to purchase $1 billion worth of Lucid's stock, increasing the Kingdom's ownership stake to approximately 60%. This funding infusion comes as Lucid grapples with the high costs associated with manufacturing and selling its electric vehicles.

In recent communications with investors, Lucid revealed its plans to produce approximately 9,000 units of its Air electric vehicle this year, a slight increase from the previous year. Despite its efforts to boost sales, the company has faced challenges in finding buyers for its expensive Air sedan. To counter this, Lucid has resorted to reducing prices multiple times in recent months. Additionally, the company intends to commence production of its electric Gravity SUV later this year.

Interestingly, Lucid's announcement of the investment follows CEO Peter Rawlinson's cautionary remarks about overreliance on Saudi Arabia for financial support. Rawlinson emphasized the importance of not viewing Saudi Arabia's backing as an unlimited source of wealth, emphasizing his respect for the country's investment fund. It is clear that Lucid is actively seeking alternative avenues for funding to avoid becoming overly dependent on a single source.

The additional $1 billion from Saudi Arabia will undoubtedly provide a much-needed boost to Lucid's financial position. With a significant cash burn rate and a loss of $2.8 billion in 2023, the company's cash reserves stood at just under $1.4 billion at the end of the year. The new funding will help alleviate some of the financial pressures and allow Lucid to continue its operations and pursue its growth plans.

Lucid's decision to secure funding from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund is not without its risks. While the financial injection will provide immediate relief, it is crucial for Lucid to diversify its investor base to mitigate potential vulnerabilities. Relying heavily on a single investor exposes the company to the whims and changing priorities of that investor. By expanding its funding sources, Lucid can ensure greater stability and independence in the long run.

The electric vehicle market is highly competitive, with established players such as Tesla dominating the industry. Lucid's Air sedan, despite its luxury appeal and advanced technology, has faced challenges in capturing market share. However, with the new funding and the launch of its electric Gravity SUV on the horizon, Lucid has an opportunity to regain momentum and attract a broader customer base.

The $1 billion investment from Saudi Arabia reflects their continued confidence in Lucid's potential. By partnering with the Kingdom's Public Investment Fund, Lucid gains not only financial support but also access to valuable resources and expertise. This strategic alliance can help Lucid navigate the complexities of the global automotive industry and position itself as a formidable player in the electric vehicle space.

In conclusion, Lucid Motors' additional $1 billion funding from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund is a significant development for the company. It provides much-needed capital to address the high costs associated with building and selling its luxury electric sedan. The investment also underscores Saudi Arabia's continued belief in Lucid's prospects and their commitment to supporting the growth of the electric vehicle industry. As Lucid moves forward, diversifying its investor base and expanding its product lineup will be crucial for long-term success and sustainability.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2580.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-25 14:31:52,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/elon-musk-x-ccdh-california-lawsuit-dismissed/,A judge just killed Elon Musk's lawsuit against an anti-hate research org,"Federal Judge Rules Against Elon Musk in Lawsuit Against Nonprofit Researching Online Hate

In a recent ruling, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit brought by Elon Musk and X against the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), a nonprofit organization dedicated to researching online hate. The lawsuit, filed by X, accused the CCDH of spreading misleading claims after the organization published reports highlighting hate and extremism on the platform. X claimed to have suffered significant financial losses as a result of the CCDH's research.

In addition to these allegations, Musk and X also accused the CCDH of scraping data illegally and violating the platform's rules by using a third-party social media monitoring tool called Brandwatch. Musk, who personally directed the lawsuit, referred to the CCDH as ""an evil propaganda machine"" in his replies on X.

Last year, the CCDH filed a motion to strike X's claims under California's law against Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (SLAPP), which aims to prevent frivolous lawsuits intended to intimidate. The organization also requested that the lawsuit be dismissed. CCDH CEO Imran Ahmed accused Musk, whose net worth is around $200 billion, of deliberately prolonging the legal process to increase the organization's legal costs.

United States District Judge Charles R. Breyer of the Northern District of California granted the CCDH's motion to dismiss the lawsuit and denied Musk and X the opportunity to re-litigate the case. In his ruling, Judge Breyer stated, ""Sometimes it is unclear what is driving a litigation, and only by reading between the lines of a complaint can one attempt to surmise a plaintiff's true purpose. X Corp. has brought this case in order to punish CCDH for CCDH publications that criticized X Corp. - and perhaps in order to dissuade others who might wish to engage in such critics.""

Following Musk's increased activity on Twitter, the CCDH highlighted the rise of hate speech on the platform, including a report that examined how Musk's decision to unban several highly followed extremists could potentially boost the company's ad revenue. This included Andrew Anglin, a notorious neo-Nazi who created the white supremacist website the Daily Stormer.

Formed in 2018, the CCDH focuses on researching trends in hate speech, extremism, and misinformation on major social networks. Its research regularly exposes disturbing content across these platforms, including reports on eating disorder content on TikTok, climate denial on YouTube, and violent misogynistic threats on Instagram.

In response to the ruling, CCDH CEO Imran Ahmed stated, ""We create costs for lies and hate. The courts today have affirmed our fundamental right to research, to speak, to advocate, and to hold social media companies accountable for decisions they make behind closed doors that affect our kids, our democracy, and our fundamental human rights and civil liberties.""

The nonprofit organization was represented by Roberta Kaplan, who had recently achieved a significant victory in the E. Jean Carroll defamation suit against former President Donald Trump. Kaplan commented on the ruling, saying, ""Today's decision proves that even the world's wealthiest man cannot bend the rule of law to his will.""

Despite the CCDH's victory in California, Musk is pursuing a similar lawsuit against the left-leaning media watchdog Media Matters for America. However, in this case, X is suing Media Matters for America in Texas, where the same protections against frivolous lawsuits designed to stifle free speech do not exist as in California.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/twitter-x-logo-musk-pattern.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-25 20:33:17,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/dma-first-formal-probes/,"Apple, Google and Meta face first formal investigations under EU's DMA","The European Union has recently announced a series of investigations into major tech companies, referred to as gatekeepers, under the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Alphabet/Google, Apple, and Meta are the first to face formal non-compliance investigations under the EU's new competition rules.

Alphabet/Google will be investigated for its rules regarding steering in Google Play and self-preferencing in search results. Apple is under scrutiny for its rules on steering in the App Store and the design of choice screens for alternatives to its Safari web browser. Meta's ""pay or consent"" model will also be examined by the Commission.

A total of five investigations were announced on Monday, less than three weeks after the compliance deadline for these companies. These gatekeepers, designated under the pan-EU market power and contestability regulation, will be investigated to determine if they are breaching the rulebook, as suspected by the Commission. Violations of the DMA can result in fines of up to 10% of global annual turnover, or even 20% for repeat offenses.

The EU has up to 12 months to conclude the investigations, with a preliminary report possible within six months. However, the duration of the probes may vary from these guidelines, according to senior Commission officials.

These actions by the EU come as antitrust scrutiny on these three US firms continues to increase in their home country as well.

Criticism has been raised against the compliance plans of these three companies, stating that they do not align with the new EU law. Google has been accused of attempting to avoid the regulation's ban on self-preferencing by introducing new rich features in search results that unfairly compete with rivals. Apple's use of notifications to warn users of risks outside its ecosystem has been criticized by developers as ""scare screens."" Meta's ""pay or be tracked"" tactic has also faced condemnation from privacy and consumer rights groups.

The Commission has initiated proceedings to assess whether Alphabet and Apple have breached the DMA in relation to their app stores. The DMA requires gatekeepers to allow app developers to ""steer"" consumers to offers outside their app stores, free of charge. The Commission is concerned that their steering measures may impose various restrictions and limitations, hindering developers' ability to freely communicate, promote offers, and conclude contracts.

Regarding Google's self-preferencing, the investigation will specifically focus on Google's vertical search services, such as Google Shopping, Flights, and Hotels, and the impact these actions have on rival services.

The EU is also inspecting Apple's compliance with user choice obligations on iOS, including the ability to easily uninstall apps, change default settings, and select alternative default services through choice screens. The Commission believes that Apple's measures, including the design of the web browser choice screen, may prevent users from exercising their choice of services within the Apple ecosystem, contrary to the DMA.

As for Meta, the proceedings will investigate its ""pay or consent"" model for EU users and whether it complies with the DMA. This model requires gatekeepers to obtain user consent when combining or cross-using their personal data across different core platform services. The Commission is concerned that Meta's binary choice may not provide a real alternative if users do not consent, failing to prevent the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers.

In response to a question about these investigations, Thierry Breton, the EU's internal market commissioner, emphasized that the DMA clearly requires gatekeepers to offer a free, non-preferential choice to users.

These investigations mark a significant step by the EU in holding these tech giants accountable and ensuring fair competition in the digital market. The outcomes of these probes will have far-reaching implications for the future of these companies and the regulation of Big Tech.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1031626648.jpg?resize=1200,799",2024-03-25 12:10:10,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-high-efficiency-based-copperiodide-clusters.html,A high efficiency LED based on copper-iodide clusters,"A team of researchers led by Prof. Yao Hongbin from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) has developed a highly efficient and bright warm white light-emitting diode (LED) using copper-iodide cluster hybrids. This breakthrough technology has been published in Nature Photonics.

Solution-processed LED devices have gained significant attention as they are believed to be the future of large-area solid-state lighting. They offer a simple manufacturing process and high operability. Currently, solution-processed LED devices based on lead-halide perovskites, organic semiconductor materials, and colloidal core-shell quantum dots (QDs) have shown promising electroluminescence performance.

However, the use of materials containing heavy metals, such as lead-halide perovskites and CdSe QDs, raises serious environmental concerns. On the other hand, LED devices based on organic light-emitting molecules, InP QDs, and ZnSe QDs have high production costs due to their complex synthesis. Therefore, the development of solution-processed LED devices using low-cost, low-toxicity, easily scalable, and highly efficient emitters is a crucial challenge for the future of solid-state lighting.

To address this challenge, Prof. Yao's team designed and prepared a copper-iodine-based hybrid cluster with a broad photoluminescence spectrum. By incorporating nitrogen-phosphine chelating ligands and phosphine-containing solubilizing ligands, the team successfully obtained copper-iodide hybrid clusters with both high luminescence efficiency and solubility. These clusters demonstrated a solubility of more than 200 mg/mL and good structural stability in N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF), a cross-solvent commonly used in LED production.

The team then fabricated luminescent thin films using spin-coating in DMF. These films exhibited a low surface roughness of 0.22 nm and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of more than 70%. They were used as a luminescent layer to create low-cost warm-white LED devices through an orthogonal solvent route.

The resulting LED devices achieved impressive performance metrics. They achieved a maximum external quantum efficiency of 19.1%, a brightness of over 40,000 cd m-2, and an operational lifetime of more than 232 hours (T 50 @100 cd m-2). Furthermore, utilizing the excellent solubility and processability of the clusters, the team successfully constructed a large-area solution-processed LED device with a working area of 36 cm2 through blade-coating. This device exhibited warm white light emission with a brightness close to 60,000 cd m-2.

In addition, the team developed a series of solution-processed color-tunable LED devices by modifying different electron-donating groups on the nitrogen heterocycles of the nitrogen-phosphine chelating ligands.

This groundbreaking work by Prof. Yao's team has demonstrated the potential of copper-iodide hybrid clusters in fabricating low-cost and high-performance LED panels for solid-state lighting. The expandability and tunability of the clusters make them a promising choice for the future of LED technology.
