A San Francisco politician is now accusing autonomous vehicle company Cruise of “telling a half truth” with regard to its responsibility in the wake of a recent incident where a woman was struck by a human-driven car and then was immediately also hit by one of its robotaxis.
The company previously said in a statement sent to Forbes and other media that the woman was first hit Monday evening around 9:30 p.m. by a human-driven car while crossing a busy downtown street. Then, after being knocked into another lane of traffic, she was then struck by a Cruise autonomous vehicle (AV), which, according to the company, “braked aggressively to minimize the impact.”
However, in an interview with Forbes, San Francisco Supervisor Aaron Peskin now says that while the robotaxi may have attempted to avoid hitting her, the AV “dragged her underneath the car for approximately 20 feet, which was the source of her major injuries.”
The woman, whose identity remains unknown, remains in critical condition, according to Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital.
When Forbes asked Cruise to specifically respond to Peskin’s allegation that the AV “dragged” the woman, causing her to be injured further, the company said that it had nothing further to add.
“We have shared all pertinent information with regulators and investigators and are focused on assisting the police with identifying the person responsible, who left the scene,” Hannah Lindow, a Cruise spokesperson, said in an email. “Our thoughts continue to be with the individual who was injured, hoping they make a rapid and full recovery.”
Neither the San Francisco Police Department, which is leading an ongoing investigation into the incident, nor the San Francisco Fire Department, which also responded to the scene, provided comment on Peskin’s account.
“We cannot confirm or deny what the Supervisor said,” Sgt. Kathryn Winters, an SFPD spokesperson, emailed Forbes. “This is an open and active investigation, and investigators are reviewing all available evidence to determine the facts of the incident.”
The SFPD declined to provide an estimate as to when its investigation would be complete.
SFFD Capt. Justin Schorr, a spokesperson, told Forbes that he happened to be blocks away when he received the call, and was the first firefighter to lay eyes on the victim. He described her injuries as “life-threatening,” and “consistent with being struck or run over and being trapped under a vehicle.”
Since the California Public Utilities Commission’s August decision to allow Cruise and its primary rival, Waymo, to offer paid services 24 hours a day in San Francisco, Cruise cars in particular have been involved in a number of incidents. These include: seemingly not yielding to a fire truck en route to an emergency, getting stuck in wet concrete, causing a traffic jam at a local music festival and, according to the SFFD, even briefly preventing an ambulance from leaving the scene of a different car crash where the victim ultimately died after being brought to a hospital.
That’s not to mention dozens of smaller disruptive episodes that the SFFD has documented, which include blocking fire stations, running over hoses and not yielding to sirens and blaring horns.
“All a car has to do is stop somewhere and we’re screwed,” SFFD Chief Jeanine Nicholson told Forbes previously. “Seconds matter, when it comes to an emergency. A fire can double in size in a minute, or in a medical call, an extra minute literally means more of your heart will die.”
Cruise, which is a subsidiary of General Motors, has ambitious plans to make its billions of dollars of investment turn into a profitable business model. According to research from McKinsey published earlier this year, there is potential to generate hundreds of billions in revenue across the entire AV industry before 2030.
For now, Cruise only operates in San Francisco, Austin, and Phoenix, but is currently testing in at least 10 other U.S. cities, including San Diego and Nashville.
“San Francisco for us is just the beginning,” Davide Bacchet, then the company’s distinguished engineer in robotics, said in a November 2021 marketing video. “And we are prepared to expand to other cities and other countries. The size of our fleet is going to grow exponentially.”
However, for Sup. Peskin, this level of confidence gives him pause. He wants Cruise and similar AV companies to be held to the “highest safety standards.”
“San Francisco is in the unique position of being the guinea pig and the first testing ground for the deployment of AVs and soon they will be everywhere,” he said. “This won’t be just San Francisco’s issue. This is really yet another example of what state and federal regulators and policymakers need to address before these things are deployed in cities everywhere.”",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65203a884ca6633dc3dd88b1/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=1200,2023-10-06 13:31:05
https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/10/06/20-tech-leaders-share-habits-they-encourage-their-teams-to-cultivate/,20 Tech Leaders Share Habits They Encourage Their Teams To Cultivate,"getty
For many of us, our routines set the tone for each day, from how we feel to how well our work goes. Adopting smart daily habits can be especially helpful for tech professionals, who are often faced with lengthy to-do lists and complex work. In the course of their careers, tech leaders learn and develop the kinds of practices that lead to success in a challenging profession.
Part of the role of a tech leader is to model and encourage habits that foster productivity, innovation and professional growth among their team members. Below, 20 members of Forbes Technology Council share the daily routines and strategies they encourage their teams to build and the positive impact they’ve seen these practices achieve.
1. Prioritizing Self Development
Every morning, before you open your email inbox, spend some time reading and learning. Once you’ve opened your inbox, you’ll be dealing with the urgent things you need to deal with, rather than spending time on what is important and valuable. - Noam Mizrahi, Marvell
2. Taking Notes Before Closing Tickets
Don’t just close tickets; take good notes on what was wrong, what you tried and what eventually worked. This simple practice boosts self-awareness; promotes shared, continuous learning; and encourages proactive problem solving. Over time, it leads to more efficient troubleshooting and faster resolutions for the entire team. - Rob Tillman, Copy Chief©
Forbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives. Do I qualify?
3. Taking Time Today To Prep For Tomorrow
One daily habit I always encourage is the “20-minute wind-down.” Before wrapping up the day, I ask my team to spend 20 minutes reviewing what they’ve done and planning for tomorrow. It sounds simple, but this reflection and foresight help iron out potential issues and set a clear path for the next day. - Arun Kumar, Revature
4. Building Intentional Relationships With Colleagues
People don’t care what you know until they know that you care. It’s easy to become inundated in information overload and get stuck behind a series of words on a screen. Being deliberate about taking time out to foster relationships with your team and colleagues stimulates real connections, and those connections drive buy-in to the common goal. - Ajay Khari, Meltwater
5. ‘Eating The Frog’
“Eat the frog” first thing in the morning. Make sure you take care of your most important task or priority before the day (emails, meetings and so on) starts. You’ll be amazed at how effective you are when you’re not worrying the entire day about finishing what you really need to finish. It’s already done! - Lewie Dunsworth, Nuspire
6. Exercising
Exercise every day—not just your mind, but your body. Exercise clears the mind, refreshes the spirit and gives your brain the space it needs away from work. Our team is more productive because we give ourselves the time and space to focus on being active. - Rohana Meade, Synergy Technical
7. Taking Risks
Take risks, and dare to fail. We like to say, “We can fix what you do; we cannot fix what you don’t.” Encourage your team to embrace failure as an opportunity to learn and explore better ideas and solutions. If you are always successful, did you push hard enough to find the answer no one else was looking for? Just solving the problem is boring; find the real answers by learning. - Jim Parkinson, North American Bancard
8. Remembering The Team’s Mission
Being a team implies that each member agrees to pursue an aspirational goal. The goal is bigger than what any single member can achieve individually. One daily habit I encourage with my team members is to remember our mission. The mission is a lifestyle. Regular reminders help us to achieve that. It allows us to weather the ups and downs of tech challenges, people conflicts, health issues and so on. - Altaz Valani, DevSecOpsMentor.com
9. Cultivating Curiosity
The tech space is always changing, so I encourage my team to cultivate their curiosity to promote an ongoing culture of learning. Within this environment, team members are motivated to stay informed about ever-evolving technologies and keep their skills up to date. Exposure to new ideas can positively impact team members and the business by inspiring creative thinking and driving innovation. - Todd Fisher, CallTrackingMetrics
10. Participating In Hackathons
Technology changes rapidly, and it is important for the team to stay abreast of the changes. However, being “in-the-know” is not enough. Unless new information is put to use, it will be “out of sight, out of mind.” I encourage team members to get into hackathon sessions and produce tangible results that can be showcased to customers. The approach creates a sense of ownership and accomplishment in the team. - Nagaraj Sastry, Trianz Digital Consulting Inc
11. Taking Time To Consider Your Users
Take time to consider your users every day. We get caught up in personal, team and corporate objectives and our day-to-day tasks, and those are certainly important. But at least once per day, you should give some time and consideration to your users. How are internal and external forces changing their experiences? Is there something you could do today that would drive positive change for them? - Patti Mikula, Hackworks Inc.
12. Reading About The Industry (A Lot)
The current speed of change and advancements in the technology arena is unprecedented. To survive, you really must read a lot (“bedtime reading”) and expose yourself to various new papers and articles that cover new trends. This has become a key learning habit these days. Beyond that, get into the habit of talking with your peers and attending various tech events around you. Things move fast! - Nir Kaldero, NEORIS / CEMEX
13. Honing Tech Skills
Tech leaders must push their teams to hone their tech skills every day. Today, tech skills are becoming obsolete quicker than ever. Staying abreast of emerging technologies is fundamental to everyone, not just those in tech roles. By engendering a learner’s mindset, tech leaders and their teams can begin closing the skills gaps that stifle innovation within their organizations. - Aaron Skonnard, Pluralsight
14. Pursuing Fresh Knowledge And Insights
As a tech leader, integrating continuous learning into your daily routine is key to staying up-to-date with rapid tech advancements. By setting aside time for reading, subscribing to industry-specific newsletters, participating in online forums or even engaging in short daily tech podcasts, you can help ensure that you’re consistently exposed to fresh insights and evolving best practices. - Rachel Lyubovitzky, Setuply, Inc.
15. Carefully Managing Time
Effective time management is one everyday habit I encourage my IT team members to practice. This habit boosts productivity, decreases stress, improves focus, ensures deadlines are met, improves work-life balance and promotes professional development. It enables colleagues to make the most of their working hours while also contributing to the success of the team and the business. - Neelima Mangal, Spectrum North
16. Automating One Repetitive Task
Automate one task away every day. Too often, our staff gets annoyed by performing simple, repetitive tasks, such as double data entry, resetting a user password twice or clicking on duplicated confirmation emails. Reducing this busy work often seems like too much of a hassle; however, it can significantly improve the quality of life for an employee. - Kevin Korte, Univention
17. Reviewing Code And Doing QA Checks
Conducting daily code reviews and quality assurance checks can help uphold high coding standards and guarantee the delivery of error-free software. This habit has a positive impact on the team’s productivity and the quality of the product. It prevents issues from piling up and becoming major roadblocks later in the development cycle. - Cristian Randieri, Intellisystem Technologies
18. Creating Concise Agendas For Every Meeting
As a tech leader, I emphasize the importance of concise, agenda-driven meetings—meetings that are only held when necessary, not habitually. This habit ensures we use our time judiciously, preventing meeting fatigue and allowing for more uninterrupted deep work, which is vital in the tech landscape. - Amitkumar Shrivastava, Fujitsu
19. Experimenting With Generative AI
I encourage my team to use ChatGPT or other generative AI tools. The possibilities of this technology are truly remarkable. The more individuals are able to familiarize themselves with these tools, the more efficient and prepared they will be as generative AI continues to become further ingrained into our daily lives and workflows. - Gleb Polyakov, Nylas
20. Checking In With The Team
I know these aren’t exactly “popular,” but we have daily 5-minute check-ins that work well. We make it a hard 5 minutes, and team members talk about what they’ve accomplished, what they’re currently working on and what help they might need. This has been especially helpful for our developers, who can get stuck in the weeds. - Jordan Yallen, MetaTope",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65200e13afd2051d7622eece/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=1200,2023-10-06 13:15:01
https://www.forbes.com/sites/nishatalagala/2023/10/06/what-new-business-models-will-ai-create-next/,What New Business Models Will AI Create Next?,"A brain turning on a light Pixabay
I recently heard a wonderful quote from a presenter at an AI conference. It essentially said - “Whatever disruption you can imagine AI will create, is nothing compared to what you cannot imagine”. This article explores this insight and what, as a business, you can do to benefit, or at least not suffer, from this likely scenario.
Let's examine what other fundamental business models have been created through technology. Twenty years ago, would you have imagined the following?
You land in a foreign city (or country) in the middle of the night. You walk out of the airport and get into a car you have never seen before, driven by someone you do not know. The driver takes you to an apartment you have never seen before, owned by someone you do not know. You take the key from a box and enter. You stay the night in the apartment.
Twenty years ago this could have easily been a life-threatening proposition. However, between Uber and Airbnb, many of us now do this regularly. We trust the combination of data, analytics, crowdsourced feedback, and AI, that make up these services. We cannot imagine our lives without them.
The same goes for AI. The obvious disruptions are already very serious. Take as an example - what happened to Chegg - whose stock dropped nearly 50% in one day after generative AI’s impact on business was known. This is the case when an AI powered version of a competitive product poses nearly instant and serious threat to an established business by creating an appealing alternative . However, as time goes on - we can expect AI to generate fundamental shifts to underlying business models, in ways that are hard to fathom today.
So - what can you do?
You may ask yourself - what can I do? I don’t even know what these new ideas are that can threaten my business? Here is what I suggest
Integrate AI into as many of your products as you think reasonable - but to at least some of them. Do not wait for the biggest idea. Invest in small improvements that generate meaningful ROI. Invest time in thinking about how AI can improve your existing products and enable new products. Learn along the way.
Train your employees on AI. These new business models will come from somewhere. If your employees understand what AI is, and have experience using AI to improve your current products - it is far more likely that these foundational ideas will come from your company.
Once your employees understand some AI - it will be much easier for them to process the deluge of AI news, new products and technologies that are raining down on us now every day. It will be easier for them to see potentials for your business, instead of being overwhelmed and avoiding it.
AI is not going to go away. My recommendation is to jump in and learn to navigate. It will make it much easier to see new places where you can take your business or, if someone else beats you to it - to be a fast follower.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65203bd9cad7db72c330b81b/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=1200,2023-10-06 13:00:22
https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhaseltine/2023/10/06/the-needles-edge-autonomous-robotic-surgery-and-its-implications-for-medicine/,The Needle’s Edge: Autonomous Robotic Surgery And Its Implications For Medicine,"smart medical health care concept, surgery robotic machine use allows doctors to perform many types ... [+] of complex procedures with more precision, flexibility and control than is possible getty
This story is part of a series on the current progression in Regenerative Medicine. This piece discusses advances in the use of artificial intelligence in medical robotics.
In 1999, I defined regenerative medicine as the collection of interventions that restore to normal function tissues and organs that have been damaged by disease, injured by trauma, or worn by time. I include a full spectrum of chemical, gene, and protein-based medicines, cell-based therapies, and biomechanical interventions that achieve that goal.
Autonomous medical robots may be conducting full medical operations sooner rather than later. In a previous article for the regenerative medicine series, I discussed the oncoming proliferation of artificial intelligence-assisted medical robots in our healthcare system. One such example of these robots in use is during surgical procedures. I discussed the semi-autonomous Da Vinci robot system, which aids physicians during complicated procedures, but more recently, a new fully autonomous robotic surgery has emerged.
In an article for Science, Dr. Alan Kuntz and colleagues from the University of Utah and elsewhere describe a new autonomous medical robot that can steer a needle through live tissue. More precisely, the system was shown to acutely navigate a pig lung without causing damage, steering the needle to a specified target location. This could be the first of many such robots in the near future. Here, I discuss Kuntz and colleagues’ needle-steering robot and the implications it may have on the future of regenerative medicine.
As our understanding of medicine and surgical procedures advances, so too does the difficulty and intricacy of surgery itself. What was once a practice concurrently conducted in barbershops is now one of the most difficult professions in the workforce. Some surgical procedures require immense precision, and the slightest misstep could result in the death of a patient.
Herein lies the use case for robotics in surgery settings. If the involuntary hand movements of even the most seasoned surgeon could be removed, so could the risk of injury to the patient.
While semi-autonomous robots are typical, if not common, in today’s healthcare system, Kuntz and colleagues designed medical to fill the void of fully autonomous robot surgeons. Specifically, needle-guiding systems driven by fully autonomous robots had not yet been achieved.
Their robotic system makes use of a laser-patterned, highly flexible steerable needle. Whereas most needles are rigid and inflexible, this needle is ideal for traversing curved paths typical in surgical settings to reduce the risk of damage to nearby tissue.
FIGURE 1: Schematic diagram of the laser-patterned, highly flexible steerable needle. Kuntz et al.
The robot uses three methods to remain fully autonomous and avoid causing damage to nearby tissue: replanning, control, and safe insertion time windows.
Replanning is the real-time adjustment of the preinstalled surgical plan based on the patient’s anatomy or other unexpected events during surgery. Control is the ability of the robot to control its movements without the intervention of a surgeon, allowing the robot to adjust course based on the previous replanning step. Safe insertion time windows are the phases of the patient’s breathing cycle in which needles can be safely inserted and moved, which the robot constantly monitors simultaneously.
In a lung biopsy test on the organ of a pig, the autonomous system achieved targeting errors less than the radius of clinically relevant lung nodules, meaning in a live human patient, no notable damage would have been caused to the lung tissues. Additionally, Kuntz and colleagues found that their robotic system was more accurate than standard manual bronchoscopy techniques, suggesting that autonomous robots may prove more effective at such intricate procedures than humans.
FIGURE 2: (A) Autonomous medical robot conducting steering needle procedure on a pig lung; (B) 3D ... [+] rendering of steering needle navigating the lung. Kuntz et al.
The benefits of autonomous medical robots for intricate procedures are obvious. Increased accuracy will enable far less user error in surgical settings, and robots will likely complete the procedure far quicker, saving the hospital, the doctor, and the patient valuable time.
There are, however, drawbacks as well to the introduction of these procedures to our healthcare system. First and foremost is a robotic malfunction. No machine ever built has been without flaw, whether a coding mistake or regular wear and tear over time. At some point, one of these machines will malfunction during an operation, likely causing significant complications for the patient.
Another concern of note is cost. These robots will not be cheap; in a hospital setting, it is safe to assume some of that cost will be passed onto the patient. While those who can afford it could benefit from the implementation of these systems, for those without quality health insurance, these procedures will be out of reach financially for many years.
Ultimately, however, I see great promise in the introduction of autonomous medical robots in surgical settings. This is the future we are headed towards, so we should ensure that these systems are of the highest quality when they arrive in our hospitals.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon drew headlines this week with his statement, in a Bloomberg television interview, that artificial intelligence could allow the next generation of workers to only work 3.5 days a week. It’s worth noting that this much-covered prognostication, if you watch the actual interview, seemed less a bold, go-out-on-a-limb prediction from Dimon than just one part of a long list of ways he thinks AI could have upsides in addition to downsides. Technology has long replaced jobs, he argued—but it’s done much good, too.
Whether or not AI is what ultimately gets us to that Keynesian prediction of only working 15 hours a week—less, of course, than Dimon’s predicted 28—it’s interesting to consider how AI may finally trigger more adoption of the four-day week that many have been pushing for recently. The UAW, after all, has a four-day week among its list of demands as it continues its historic strike against the Big Three automakers. Add the technological capabilities of AI to such mainstream conversation about what was once a fringe idea, and it might be adopted in more places more quickly than we think.
Want some ideas for what works and what doesn’t with a four-day week? Check out our contributors’ advice here and here. We’ve also chronicled the results of studies about how four-day work week experiments have been going (hint: pretty well).

POLICY & PRACTICE
After a three-year pause on student loan repayments, millions of Americans are once again facing college debt bills as repayments resumed on Oct. 1—an event experts say could prompt employers to step up with more relief, combined with new legislation and growing demand from workers for more help after years of escalating costs. My colleague Emmy Lucas has an insightful look at the legislative and other causes that could finally get employers more on board to help.
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
Several work-related platforms added new AI capabilities this week. LinkedIn said Tuesday it was releasing new AI tools for recruiting and chatbots for career coaching, as well as predicting a 65% shift in job skills by 2030 due to AI. Meanwhile, work management software Asana announced new AI capabilities for increasing productivity and innovation.

Amid significant job cuts and tech-driven disruption, data from Hired found that demand for job postings on its platform dropped over the past four years, and that tech salaries, when adjusting for inflation, decreased 9% from $141,000 to $129,000 between 2022 to mid-2023, the lowest level in five years. Check out contributor Jack Kelly’s report on the study, as well as the latest from our layoff tracker.
In wage news, United Airline pilots won a 40% raise, as its union ratified a new contract amid a push from unions across U.S. industries to give workers higher pay and more protections. Meanwhile, a judge in New York ruled that Uber, DoorDash and Grubhub must pay $18 an hour to New York City delivery drivers, denying an attempt from the food delivery giants to block a city minimum wage law—aimed at helping regulate pay for gig workers—from going into effect. Finally, California fast food workers secured a $20 minimum wage—the highest in the U.S.—when Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a new law Thursday raising pay from California’s current $15.50 rate.
The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued Tesla, one of billionaire Elon Musk’s companies, late last week, alleging the company has allowed “widespread and ongoing racial harassment of its Black employees” and retaliated against workers who opposed it for nearly a decade, the suit alleges. Forbes’ Molly Bohannon reported that Forbes has reached out to Tesla for comment; the Wall Street Journal reported that Tesla has said it “strongly opposes all forms of discrimination and harassment” and that it has a track record of disciplining and terminating employees who engage in misconduct.
What’s Next: Tome Cofounder And CEO Keith Peiris

I spoke recently with Keith Peiris, the cofounder and CEO of Tome, an AI storytelling startup that Forbes reported in February passed a million users 134 days after launch—one of the fastest productivity tools to reach that number (Peiris shared even bigger numbers below). We chatted about how AI natives approach work differently, what business is looking for with AI and the future of that most universal of work tools, the slide deck. Excerpts from our conversation below have been lightly edited for length and clarity.
Tell us a little about Tome?
We [Tome’s cofounders] came from a consumer social world; we all worked on different kinds of communication products. So a lot of our thinking was around ‘Hey, when you look at what Instagram or Snap did to make real world storytelling powerful, expressive and simple through the smartphone, can we do the same thing with ideas and concepts in your head?’ For us, the technology that made that possible was foundation [large language] models to help you find narrative, find structure, to shape what you're saying. To me, that was very analogous to a camera that's connected to a 5G network in your pocket.
We decided to just launch it like a consumer product to see what would happen. There's been a lot of demand. We went from 0 to 10 million users in less than nine months, and it continues to grow. Through that, we're actually finding there is a different style of work emerging in Tome.
What do you mean by that?
I'll start by saying it's a little generational. A big chunk of our users—I think almost 30%—you would classify as Gen Z. They haven't been trained on PowerPoint for 25 years. So I think they're open-minded on [what’s] the right way to work.
In the old world, you used to show up to Google Slides or PowerPoint with a very succinct summary of what you wanted to say. I already had this narrative in my head. I know what I want to put on each slide, and now I'm going to open this tool and type it out, drag things around and make it pretty. I call that the last mile of presentation building or storytelling. You've done all of the hard cognitive work already and now you go to this tool to manifest what's in your head.
The biggest difference we see with AI native users is they're showing up to our tool with considerably less. They're showing up with, ‘I think I've got an idea of the way I want to write my pitch deck, but show me a couple of variations. Show me the eight-page version, the 12-page version, the Y Combinator version.’ They're looking at it for brainstorming; for inspiration.
So AI is not just helping to speed up your work, or simplify, but it's actually changing how people approach work.
It's always more fun and more fruitful to collaborate with a thought partner. At Tome we have this rule that engineers always need to be working with one other engineer. The code quality is better. The thinking is better. Suddenly [with AI] we're giving folks a thought partner that's really fast, that’s awake 24/7, that you can just sort of give commands to, and it won't get tired of you.
I’ve seen Tome described as like an AI-driven stand-in for PowerPoint. Is that fair?
I personally argue it's a little too narrow. The reason I say that is I'm not sure the slide is going to make it. Over the next 30 years I’m not sure we're all going to be looking at a 16x9 static rectangle. We're working on phones. We’re working through Zoom. All of our data is live in the cloud. Our attention spans are shorter because of TikTok. I think the slide deck is on the decline. There are companies in Silicon Valley that refuse to even use [slide decks].
We're taking a lot of PowerPoint use cases. Sales decks and pitch decks and all of that stuff. But we're getting other stuff, too. People are making resumes in Tome, they're building how-to guides. They're writing documents. They’re doing a bunch of different things with Tome that I don't think you would do that with slides.
FACTS AND COMMENT
Busting the “lazy girl” jobs chatter is the latest report on women in the workplace from LeanIn and McKinsey, Forbes’ Maggie McGrath reports. At every level of the corporate pipeline, the 9th annual report finds, women are as committed to their careers as their male counterparts, McGrath writes, even as men continue to dominate the highest levels of company leadership. The rules of ambition may be changing, and even showing up in quieter forms, new studies show, but women aren’t lacking it, the LeanIn/McKinsey report finds.
81%: The percentage of women who say they want to be promoted to a higher level this year, up from 70% in 2019.
28%: The representation of women in the C-suite, according to McKinsey and LeanIn, a higher level than ever before. Just 6% of leaders in the C-suite are women of color, however.
“Something got into the ethos suggesting” those who want to work remotely or flexibly are less motivated, McKinsey senior partner Alexis Krivkovich told Forbes. “Rather than flexible work being something that's muting ambition, it's actually unleashing it.”

The Clorox cyberattack crisis warrants every board’s attention. The consumer-products giant spent over $500 million on IT upgrades and earned a spot on the 2023 Forbes Most Cybersecure Companies list. Nonetheless, an August breach halted its operations with devastating supply chain and business consequences.
While the cybercrime details remain unclear, Clorox disclosed that it was forced back to manual processes, as automation systems took nearly six weeks to normalize. That left retailers and consumers scrambling for merchandise. In terms of the financial aftermath, its preliminary FY2024 Q1 results suffered significantly:
“Order processing delays and significant product outages” dented quarterly sales by 28%.
Lower gross margins are anticipated, as “the impact of the cybersecurity attack more than offset the benefits of pricing, cost savings and supply chain optimization [and] lower cost absorption driven by lower volume.”
Quarterly earnings per share will show a loss rather than positive result.
Remediation efforts and expenditures will extend well into FY 2024.
The capital markets have not responded kindly, as Clorox shares are down over 25% since the August news, trading at or near five-year lows. That’s over $3 billion in lost market valuation.
The damage is measurable and the lessons should be clear. As cyber threats surge, the alarming scale, speed and scope of the upheaval at Clorox should motivate senior leaders in all organizations to question, assess and fortify business resilience, operational agility and technological readiness — before it’s too late.
Fight Fire With Fire
While no company is immune to cyber risk, strong, substantive digital era leadership is widely lacking. Here are four immediate, meaningful actions organizations can take to boost business resilience:
1. Seriously address board composition.
The SEC’s long-awaited cybersecurity regulations exclude board tech expertise. Not surprisingly, cyber expertise on boards remains rare. According to recent research by the Wall Street Journal, only “107 directors at 113 [S&P 500] companies had professional experience in cybersecurity.” Further, those leaders “held a total of 124 [2.3%] of S&P 500 board seats.”
Clorox was no exception. Astonishingly, despite the ongoing cyber crisis, its 2023 Proxy Statement reveals no plans for a board technology committee and none of the twelve seated and nominated directors has any credible tech experience. One member, Julia Denman, works in Microsoft’s audit and finance function. However, tech firm employment does not constitute the background cyber threats demand.
2. Equip the board with independent insights.
Chris Hetner, former senior cybersecurity advisor to SEC Chairs Mary Jo White and Jay Clayton and currently Nasdaq Center for Board Excellence Insights Council member and senior cyber risk advisor to the National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD), advocates mirroring risk transfer market methodologies. For instance, the NACD endorsed X-Analytics as the preferred boardroom cyber risk reporting solution for their over 23,000 members. X-Analytics is a patented and validated cyber risk decisioning platform that ties an enterprise’s cyber risk probability, severity and control effectiveness to financial loss probabilities.
Hetner explained, “Clorox’s shutdown reinforces that cybersecurity threats introduce business, operational and financial harm. Now’s the time to deliver effective executive and boardroom reporting that expresses cyber threats and resilience strategies through the business lens.”
3. Set business interruption tolerance and deploy capital accordingly.
Hetner urges boards to re-center cybersecurity discussions on “the financial and business impact associated with each digital risk type, such as intellectual property theft, business interruption, ransomware, loss of customer data or misappropriation of funds. That immediately connects continuous cyber risk assessment to strategy and balance sheet stress.”
He suggested that cybersecurity consideration start with how much business interruption an enterprise is willing to tolerate. Boards, CEOs and CFOs must first understand the costs of a “six hour, daylong or weeklong” shutdown. Accepting that downside then more easily defines the justifiable capital allocation for adequate countermeasures,” Hetner explained.
That’s thinking differently — with a much higher chance of better outcomes. “The default tendency of CIOs and CISOs is to rely on periodic tactical and technical reports to justify tech solutions spending that may suppress risk,” Hetner highlighted. “That too often gets ‘lost in translation’ when engaging board members and the wider c-suite — leaving leadership unsure of precisely what they are funding and where residual gaps remain.”
Hetner emphasized, “When a leadership team possesses an aggregate view of risk tied to financial exposure, they can then best decide how much risk to accept, transfer or deploy capital to manage.” That downside-first view raises cybersecurity from a technical afterthought to the business strategy forefront.
4. Simulate cyberattack responses.
Last year, CNBC’s CFO Council Summit attendees participated in a ransomware attack simulation. Most senior executives felt quite unprepared, scrambled for legal advice and all paid the ransom. Noname Security CISO Karl Mattson observed. “The CFOs really struggled with calculating the break-even point of ‘to pay or not to pay. In our simulation, we realized that our business really does have a threshold of pain and lost revenue, above which the ransom payment is entirely rational. We had to build that cost/loss model on the fly.”
In the Clorox case, SafeBreach CISO Avishai Avivi, told IndustryWeek, “The fact that it will take Clorox more than a month to recover normal operations is not a good sign. It indicates to me that the adversary was able to penetrate the backbone of Clorox operations and impact multiple systems.”
He added, “While Clorox indicated in their August notification that they have activated their business continuity plan (BCP), the fact that they have still not recovered full operational capability indicates that their BCP was not complete for this particular type of disruption. A good BCP [includes] a recovery time objective (RTO). It is very rare that an RTO will be longer than a month.”
Most executives stand unready to credibly make such estimates. That’s because few have ever challenged themselves with realistic simulations.
Roll The Bones
Cyber criminals are targeting larger and seemingly more secure targets daily. Even well-funded and highly-touted Clorox was not ready, willing and able enough to withstand its breach. Who else is relying on chance over serious change?",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/651fe2e09a89aa97585c1752/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=1200,2023-10-06 12:00:36

Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, not only has there been an abundance of misinformation posted on social media about vaccines; public health officials and others have committed plenty of missteps in messaging.
A veritable flood of misinformation—often in the guise of unfounded conspiracy theories—coupled with poor communication from public health authorities contributed to the U.S. having worse Covid-19 outcomes than its peers. This is partly due to the fact that among people most at risk of severe disease—the over-65 age group, immunocompromised and those with other comorbid conditions—the U.S. trails other wealthy nations in Covid-19 vaccination rates.
In their book, The Big Myth: How American Business Taught Us to Loathe Government and Love the Free Market, Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway suggest that many millions of Americans seemed to either “disbelieve what government officials were telling them about Covid-19 or to regard public health measures such as vaccines and mask mandates as encroachments on their liberty.”
Oreskes and Conway claim that 40% of Covid-19 deaths could have been prevented if Americans trusted science and government more.
Similarly, in The Deadly Rise of Anti-Science, Peter Hotez, researcher and professor of pediatrics, molecular virology and microbiology at the Baylor College of Medicine, writes that 200,000 Americans needlessly lost their lives to Covid-19 during the Delta and Omicron variant waves in 2021 and early 2022, respectively. According to Hotez, many refused to get vaccinated because they were victims of an organized antivaccine disinformation campaign.
And, a recently published study in JAMA Network Open suggested that if “public health recommendations” had been followed, approximately 33% of U.S. Covid-19 deaths could have been avoided.
So, what gives?
In parts of America, an inherently libertarian streak averse to government mandates of virtually any kind appears to have played a role in opposing nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as masks and social distancing, as well as Covid-19 vaccine requirements.
What’s disturbing is that the Covid-19 pandemic seems to have also brought out the vaccine skeptics in full force, not only toward coronavirus vaccines but also traditional childhood immunizations, like those targeting polio, tetanus and measles.
From smallpox inoculations—which began in the late 18th century and ended when the disease was eradicated in the 1970s—to mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, polio and measles immunizations, vaccination has saved millions of lives and prevented crippling and life-threatening illnesses from occurring.
Mass vaccination programs with single or combination shots began in the 1960s and quickly suppressed the spread of measles in most developed countries. The measles vaccine is “sterilizing,” which means it not only prevents illness, but also transmission.
Yet vaccine hesitancy is on the rise. Faltering vaccine coverage has contributed to a rise in cases of measles in New York and London, for example. According to a report issued by the U.K. Health Security Agency, London is in peril of a major measles outbreak that could result in tens of thousands of cases and dozens of deaths and significant morbidity. This is because levels of measles, mumps and rubella vaccinations in the U.K. are at their lowest level in 10 years.
This isn’t the first time we’ve observed an uptick in childhood vaccine hesitancy. In the U.K., vaccinations took a considerable dip in the early 2000s after false claims of a link between the MMR shot and autism were posted in the media.
Andrew Wakefield’s campaign at the turn of the millennium to connect the MMR jab to autism provides an infamous illustration of how the anti-vaccine community operates. While such assertions were unsupported by evidence, Wakefield’s trusted position as a physician-scientist helped his assertions dominate headlines, leaving a legacy of harm that persists even today, long after his work was exposed as fraudulent.
Whether MMR, polio, Covid-19 or other high-profile vaccines, the evidence pertaining to vaccinations’ extraordinarily important benefits either isn’t getting through to people, or they’re being misled by misinformation.
Americans, in particular, appear to be less trusting in science and government than they were even as recently as a few decades ago. Some experts suggest that a conspiracy mentality pervades, together with what can be construed of as an antiscience attitude.
Furthermore, a widening politically partisan gap exists regarding trust in either the clinical science or the scientific and public health community, with Republicans often taking a more skeptical view than Democrats or Independents.
To illustrate, Republican state lawmakers have blocked increases in cigarette taxes, seatbelt laws and childhood vaccination mandates. And other public health initiatives are being actively impeded.
This public health crisis is contributing to life expectancy heading in the wrong direction in America. During the past decade, there’s been an alarming decline in life expectancy in the U.S. There are multiple causes, the most recent of which is Covid-19. But even prior to the pandemic, the U.S. exhibited stagnant or even a downward trend in life expectancy, in stark contrast to its peers.
U.S. life expectancy diverges dramatically from other wealthy nations. KFF
Besides Covid-19, diseases of despair, which include drug overdose, alcoholic liver disease and suicide, are major factors. Also, gun deaths, motor vehicular fatalities and maternal and infant mortality have an outsized impact on life expectancy. What do these causes of premature deaths have in common? A large public health dimension.
Here, public health is seen as the science of reducing and preventing injury, disease and death while promoting the health and well-being of the population through the use of evidence-based policies and practices. In light of this, a comprehensive and multifaceted public health approach centered around improved messaging is needed to reverse the negative trend in life expectancy.
A critical review of how the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention handled Covid-19 found that its pandemic policies failed, particularly with respect to communication, which at times was muddled and inconsistent, and even “confusing and overwhelming.”
Consider masks, for instance. In the spate of 16 months—from March 2020 to July 2021—Americans were given conflicting and sometimes diametrically opposed information. First we were told to only wear masks if you are sick or caring for someone who is ill. Then in April 2020 the policy changed to everyone should wear masks. Subsequently, once the vaccine rollout began in the winter and spring of 2021 the CDC shifted its stance: No masks for fully vaccinated people, but masks must be worn by the unvaccinated. And soon after, once it became apparent in the summer of 2021 that reinfections were common, CDC backpedaled and advised the public to mask up indoors, vaccinated or not.
Rochelle Walensky, former director of the CDC, bluntly stated that, “for 75 years, CDC and public health have been preparing for Covid-19, and in our big moment, our performance did not reliably meet expectations.”
It is no wonder therefore that in 2021, at a critical time during the pandemic, only about half of Americans trusted the CDC.
While federal government agencies can do a better job at communicating, private sector stakeholders can, too.
In the winter and spring of 2021, for example, the CEO of Pfizer, Albert Bourla, posted messages on social media saying the Covid-19 vaccine would stop transmission. In April 2021, for instance, Bourla tweeted, “Excited to share that updated analysis from our Phase 3 study with BioNTech also showed that our Covid-19 vaccine was 100% effective in preventing Covid-19 cases in South Africa. 100%!”
Yet, four months earlier, in December 2020, based on data submitted by Pfizer which did not evaluate the shot’s effect on transmission, the Food and Drug Administration declared: “At this time, data are not available to make a determination about how long the vaccine will provide protection, nor is there evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person.” The FDA has not altered its stance since.
CDC issued a report in August 2022 saying that the Covid-19 vaccine offered limited “transient protection” but that this quickly wanes over time.
In hindsight, perhaps a more cautious approach to informing the public about the benefits of Covid-19 vaccination would have been more fruitful: That is, emphasizing the vaccine’s effectiveness against severe disease and not transmission.
On the Covid-19 treatment Paxlovid, Bourla again committed an unforced error. After reports of rebound effect from some patients who took Paxlovid, the CEO told Bloomberg News that patients can take another course, “like you do with antibiotics.”
The FDA quickly rebuked Bourla’s proposed solution as it was not indicated.
Drawing lessons for future pandemics, regardless of whether messaging emanates from public health authorities or drug companies it’s critically important to be consistent, cautious and credible when communicating the clinical science.
Moreover, going forward, the U.S. must carry out the difficult work of adopting strategies that support sound public health measures while countering science denialism. In this context, officials will have to strike a delicate balance.
Additionally, it’s invariably more constructive when public health messages target those people who stand the most to gain from preventive measures.
To illustrate, a Covid-19 booster campaign focused on the most at risk from the virus is a preferable strategy for today. A CDC report found that in 2023 adults over 65 made up almost two-thirds of people hospitalized with Covid-19 and 90% of deaths, but fewer than 25% were up to date on the recommended vaccines. Instead of aiming at this vulnerable population, however, the 33-year-old star tight-end Travis Kelce is the face of the latest Covid-19 booster. Perhaps it would make better sense to aggressively promote the product to those for whom there is proportionately far more benefit.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6520323d7853983ee44c781c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3310,1863,x0,y170,safe&width=1200",2023-10-06 11:50:16
https://www.forbes.com/sites/forrester/2023/10/06/in-2023-product-experts-gain-influence-amid-financial-constraints/,"In 2023, Product Experts Gain Influence Amid Financial Constraints","In 2023, business buyers around the world are overwhelmingly price-sensitive as they navigate macroeconomic headwinds such as inflation, the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and a generational shift in the workforce. To understand how these factors affect business buying behavior, Forrester surveyed more than 18,000 global respondents to glean their latest preferences. According to Forrester, four key factors are influencing business buying decisions in 2023. They include:
Financial constraints. The gap between budgets and offering prices contributed to a stalled business buying environment, with a whopping 89% of respondents citing one or more stall reasons. This dynamic translated into price topping buyers’ list of most important information in their journey, indicating that they are thinking less about abstract business concerns such as how an offering may fit with future industry trends. Instead, those issues are taking a back seat to questions typically seen in the later stages of the buying cycle. Vendor-owned interactions. Buyers derived more meaning from vendors than they did from other sources, including industry conferences and general business publications. Specifically, product experts rose as the most influential people in the buying cycle, adding clarity and value as buyers sifted through mounds of information. Buyers also gravitated to sales representatives and customer service/success teams. These three players, all vendor-owned and orchestrated, must work together to address how their offerings best meet buyer needs and drive growth. When it comes to content, vendor presentations topped the list for buyer influence in complex purchases. Generational differences. Last year marked an inflection point in the way younger and older buyers journeyed through their business decisions. In this year’s survey, 71% of respondents were categorized as “younger buyers,” as they fall within the Millennial and Generation Z cohorts, followed by 29% of respondents who were categorized as “older buyers,” from Generation X and Baby Boomer cohorts. Older buyers are twice as likely to identify previous experience with a provider as a primary trigger for reaching out to one for information than younger buyers. Tenure and experience played a role in how buyers navigated various challenges in the buying cycle, particularly at the executive level. For example, younger buyers cited “unable to build internal consensus on vendor selection” as a stall reason much more frequently than older buyers. Regional practices. Forrester data confirms regional differences in buying patterns across the globe but particularly in the Asia Pacific region, where buyers rely on trust and relationships with vendors to make purchase decisions. We see an emerging importance of social issues throughout the buying journey, however. Asia Pacific buyers are more influenced by a provider’s commitment to people, whether through diversity, equity, and inclusion programs; sustainability initiatives; or overall customer experience. Turning to North America, buyers were more autonomous and made decisions with fewer people across fewer departments than the rest of the world. Additionally, at least a third of B2B business buyers in North America and Europe, and more than a quarter in Asia Pacific, are primarily influenced by price when making purchasing decisions.
Ultimately, buying decisions were delayed due to budget constraints and continued economic uncertainty. In this business climate, buyers expect price transparency and providers to meet their preferences and needs across all stages of their purchase journey. Increasing access to the information they crave, especially pricing, will remove friction from buyers’ research process and help them make better-informed decisions. For providers, it can accelerate the buying process and increase sales productivity.

Six former United States surgeons general have called on policymakers to recognize the impact buildings can have on a person’s health and wellbeing.
The former surgeons general and other public health experts have called on decision-makers to recognise the numerous benefits of healthy buildings in an open letter, organized by the International WELL Building Institute.
The open letter warns the relationship between the built environment and a person’s health has been “largely ignored”, while issues like indoor air quality are “often overlooked”.
“The imperative for health-driven building policy has never been more pressing,” the letter states. “Buildings must be fortified for health.”
One of letter’s signatories is the 17th surgeon general of the United States, Dr. Richard Carmona, who said in an interview the coming together of so many previous postholders on an issue like this was “unprecedented”.

“We need to build better in the future,” Dr. Carmona told me.
“It’s up to us to educate both the public and policy-makers that buildings have to be healthy.
“We should not just be building something because the colour looks cool, or because it has certain architectural features. Other health features, like the ventilation system or the ability to lockdown part of the building are equally important.”
The open letter highlights the benefits that tackling issues like sick building syndrome can have.
It references research that shows increasing minimum ventilation rates in U.S. offices from 8 to 15 liters per second could generate an estimated $38 billion in annual economic benefits.
It also references research that indoor improvements could improve cognitive function and help yield employee productivity benefits to the tune of $6,500 to $7,500 per person per year.
“There's a very positive case to be made for the built environment and creating happier spaces, which reduce stress at a time when mental health problems are rampant,” added Dr. Carmona.
“Interestingly, many of these ideas are nothing new. The Greeks and the Romans wrote about how water and being outside was therapeutic, thousands of years ago.”
Other former surgeons general to have signed the letter include Dr. David Satcher (16th), Dr. Joycelyn Edlers (15th) and Dr. Antonia Novello (14th).
The letter was also signed by former acting surgeons general Dr. Kenneth Moritsugu and Dr. Boris D. Lushniak.
Over the next decade, federal, state and local governments are expected to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the nation’s buildings.
This could include funding for affordable housing, federal buildings and schools.
The International WELL Building Institute’s president and chief executive, Rachel Hodgdon said in an interview that public awareness levels around how where we work impacts our health and wellbeing have “never been higher”.
“It’s a universally held truth within public health communities that our physical and social environments can have a greater bearing on our health and wellbeing than our genetics or access to health care,” Hodgdon told me.
But she added while there has been this growing awareness it has not necessarily translated into policies and investments to improve schools and workplaces.
“This call to action is really to say there are solutions,” she added. “And those solutions are practical and affordable.”
She said healthier building strategies can help improve cognitive functions, staff retention and lead to fewer accidents in the workplace.
In addition, access to natural daylight can help improve sleep cycles, which in turn can improve productivity.
“It really doesn't matter what sector we're talking about, or what kind of space people work in,” added Hodgdon. “They are going to benefit from healthier building strategies.”
Another of the signatories of the letter is the president and chief executive of the American Lung Association, Harold Wimmer.
Wimmer said in a statement that many of us spend most of our time inside buildings, where the levels of some pollutants are often two to five times higher than outdoor concentrations.
“Poor indoor air quality can impact anyone, but children, older adults and people living with lung disease are at a higher risk of harm and require extra protection,” he added.
“We are eager to work with policymakers to improve the health of everyone living in America.”",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/651e893605ed8fb1075e1d48/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=1200,2023-10-06 11:25:58

Yesterday, Call Of Duty fans were shown a bunch of new content coming to Modern Warfare III, Zombies mode and the new Warzone map and suite of changes coming to battle royale during the #CODNext livestream.
You can check out the new Warzone map, Urzikstan, right here. Alongside the new big map, both Rebirth Island and Fortune’s Keep are returning to the game.
The #CODNext livestream was largely a hype-fest for Modern Warfare III’s upcoming release. We definitely got to see a lot of gameplay, as a couple hundred content creators played the game live at the event and then gushed its praises afterward.
For my part, I thought the gunplay looked much too similar to Call Of Duty: Vanguard, but I have yet to get my hands on the game and I’ll have a much better sense of how it plays after this weekend’s PlayStation beta and next weekend’s PC and Xbox beta.
YouTuber TheXclusiveAce has an informative impressions video on his time with the game so far:
I definitely feel like this video has eased my mind over the Vanguard-ishness of the game, but we will see!
The first beta weekend starts today. Here’s what you need to know.
What time does the PlayStation beta begin?
The PlayStation Beta begins Friday, October 6 at 10 A.M. PT and end on Tuesday, October 10 at 10 A.M. PT.
October 6th-7th will be for Early Access only, which is limited to gamers who pre-order the game or get a code elsewhere, from influencers or promotions, etc.
Beginning on Sunday October 8th, any PlayStation gamer on PS4 or PS5 can play the beta until Tuesdasy morning at 10am PT.
The second beta weekend, which will be available to PlayStation, Xbox and PC gamers, kicks off on the 12th and runs through the 16th.
How To Play Early
You either need to pre-order to play early or get a key from a generous content creator.
Do I Need PS Plus?
You do not! If you canceled your subscription recently due to the big price-hike, you can still play the beta.
How much space will the beta take up?
The total size of the download for the PlayStation Modern Warfare III beta will be 24.813 GB plus a 1MB license checker. Not too bad, but certainly not small.
The catch here is that in order to play the beta you need Call Of Duty HQ installed, which includes Warzone and takes up another 100GB, bringing the total to just under 125GB.
What maps will be available?
All the core 6v6 maps coming to Modern Warfare III will be from the original Modern Warfare 2.
Favela
Skidrow
Estate
Rust
Highrise (Weekend 2)
What modes will be available?
A number of traditional modes like TDM and Domination will be available during the beta. Activision also revealed the new Cutthroat mode during #CODNext yesterday. This is a 3v3v3 mode based on Gunfight but played on regular 6v6 maps. This is definitely the mode I’m looking forward to most.
Modern Warfare III launches November 10th. Along with Early Access to the beta(s) if you pre-order you get to play the single-player campaign a week early. I’m looking forward to it!",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6520258fa9cca06d246bfe1e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=1200,2023-10-06 11:20:07
https://techxplore.com/news/2023-10-case-deepfakes-videos.html,Two experiments make a case for using deepfakes in training videos,"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:
FakeForward wall squats (study participant practises her wall squats. From L to R: user; someone with better skills, FakeForward). Credit: Proceedings of the 2023 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (2023). DOI: 10.1145/3544548.3581100
Watching a training video featuring a deepfake version of yourself, as opposed to a clip featuring somebody else, makes learning faster, easier and more fun, according to new research led by the REVEAL research center at the University of Bath.
This finding was seen over two separate experiments, one exploring fitness training and the other involving public speaking. The work is published in the journal Proceedings of the 2023 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems.
A deepfake is a video where a person's face or body has been digitally altered so they appear to be someone else. This technology receives highly negative press due to its potential to spread political misinformation and to maliciously develop pornographic content that superimposes the face of one person on the body of another. It also poses an existential threat to professionals in the creative industries.
Dr. Christof Lutteroth and Dr. Christopher Clarke, both from the Department of Computer Science at Bath and co-authors of the new study, say their findings present two positive use cases for deepfakes, and hope their findings catalyze more research into ways deepfake can be applied to do good in the world.
""Deepfakes are used a lot for nefarious purposes, but our research suggests that FakeForward (the name used by the researchers to describe the use of deepfake to teach a new skill) is an unexplored way of applying the technology so it adds value to people's lives by supporting and improving their performances,"" said Dr. Clarke.
Dr. Lutteroth added, ""From this study, it's clear that deepfake has the potential to be really exciting for people. By following a tutorial where they act as their own tutor, people can immediately get better at a task—it's like magic.""
More reps, greater enjoyment
For the fitness experiment, study participants were asked to watch a training video featuring a deepfake of their own face pasted over the body of a more advanced exerciser.
The researchers chose six exercises (planks, squats, wall squats, sit-ups, squat jumps and press-ups), each targeting a different muscle group and requiring different types of movement.
For each exercise, study participants first watched a video tutorial where a model demonstrated the exercise, and then had a go at repeating the exercise themselves. The model was chosen both to resemble the participant and to outperform them, though their skill level was attainable to the test subject.
The process of watching the video and mimicking the exercise was also performed using a deepfake instructor, where the participant's own face was superimposed on a model's body.
For both conditions, the researchers measured the number of repetitions, or the time participants were able to hold an exercise. Credit: University of Bath
For all exercises, regardless of the order in which the videos were watched, participants performed better after watching the video of ""themselves,"" compared to watching a video showing someone else.
""Deepfake was a really powerful tool,"" said Dr. Lutteroth. ""Immediately people could do more press-ups or whatever it was they were being asked to do. Most also marked themselves as doing the exercise better than they did with the non-deepfake tutorial, and enjoyed it more.""
Public speaking
The second FakeForward study by the same team found that deepfake can significantly boost a person's skills as a public speaker.
When the face of a proficient public speaker was replaced with a user's, learning was significantly amplified, with both confidence and perceived competence in public speaking growing after watching the FakeForward video.
Many participants felt moved and inspired by the FakeForward videos, saying things such as, ""it gives me a lot of strength,"" ""the deepfake video makes me feel that speaking is actually not that scary"" and ""when I saw myself standing there and speaking, I kinda felt proud of myself.""
Ethical concerns
In principle it's already possible for individuals to create FakeForward videos through open-source applications such as Roop and Deep Face Lab, though in practice a degree of technical expertise is required.
To guard against potential misuse, the FakeForward research team has developed an ethical protocol to guide the development of 'selfie' deepfake videos.
""For this technology to be applied ethically, people should only create self-models of themselves, because the underpinning concept is that these are useful for private consumption,"" said Dr. Clarke.
Dr. Lutteroth added, ""Just as deepfake can be used to improve 'good' activities, it can also be misused to amplify 'bad' activities—for instance, it can teach people to be more racist, more sexist and ruder. For example, watching a video of what appears to be you saying terrible things can influence you more than watching someone else saying these things.""
He added, ""Clearly, we need to ensure users don't learn negative or harmful behaviors from FakeForward. The obstacles are considerable but not insurmountable.""

A team of New York University computer scientists has created a neural network that can explain how it reaches its predictions. The work reveals what accounts for the functionality of neural networks—the engines that drive artificial intelligence and machine learning—thereby illuminating a process that has largely been concealed from users.
The breakthrough centers on a specific usage of neural networks that has become popular in recent years—tackling challenging biological questions. Among these are examinations of the intricacies of RNA splicing—the focal point of the study—which plays a role in transferring information from DNA to functional RNA and protein products.
""Many neural networks are black boxes—these algorithms cannot explain how they work, raising concerns about their trustworthiness and stifling progress into understanding the underlying biological processes of genome encoding,"" says Oded Regev, a computer science professor at NYU's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences and the senior author of the paper, which was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
""By harnessing a new approach that improves both the quantity and the quality of the data for machine-learning training, we designed an interpretable neural network that can accurately predict complex outcomes and explain how it arrives at its predictions.""
Regev and the paper's other authors, Susan Liao, a faculty fellow at the Courant Institute, and Mukund Sudarshan, a Courant doctoral student at the time of the study, created a neural network based on what is already known about RNA splicing.
Specifically, they developed a model—the data-driven equivalent of a high-powered microscope—that allows scientists to trace and quantify the RNA splicing process, from input sequence to output splicing prediction.
""Using an 'interpretable-by-design' approach, we've developed a neural network model that provides insights into RNA splicing—a fundamental process in the transfer of genomic information,"" notes Regev. ""Our model revealed that a small, hairpin-like structure in RNA can decrease splicing.""
The researchers confirmed the insights their model provides through a series of experiments. These results showed a match with the model's discovery: Whenever the RNA molecule folded into a hairpin configuration, splicing was halted, and the moment the researchers disrupted this hairpin structure, splicing was restored.

Utilizing soft, flexible materials such as cloth, paper, and silicone, soft robotic grippers act like a robot's hand to perform functions such as safely grasping and releasing objects. Unlike conventional rigid material grippers, they are more flexible and safe, and are being researched for household robots that handle fragile objects such as eggs, or for logistics robots that need to carry various types of objects. However, its low load capacity makes it difficult to lift heavy objects, and its poor grasping stability makes it easy to lose the object even under mild external impact.
Dr. Song, Kahye of the Intelligent Robotics Research Center at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), along with Professor Lee, Dae-Young of the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), have jointly developed a soft gripper with a woven structure that can grip objects weighing more than 100 kg with 130 grams of material.
The results of the study were published on August 2 in Nature Communications .
To increase the loading capacity of the soft robot gripper, the research team applied a new structure inspired by textiles, as opposed to the conventional method of developing new materials or reinforcing the structure.
The weaving technique they focused on involves tightly intertwining individual threads to create a strong fabric, which can reliably support heavy objects and has been used for centuries in clothing, bags, and industrial textiles. The team used thin PET plastic. The grippers were designed to allow the strips to intertwine and unwind into a woven structure.

The resulting woven gripper weighs 130 grams and can grip an object weighing 100 kilograms. Conventional grippers of the same weight can lift no more than 20 kilograms at most, and considering that a gripper that can lift the same weight weighs 100 kilograms, the team succeeded in increasing the load capacity relative to its own weight.
Also, the soft robot gripper developed by the research team uses plastic, which costs only a few thousand won (approx. $2) per unit of material, and can be used as a universal gripper that can grip objects of various shapes and weights, making it highly competitive in price. In addition, since the soft robot gripper can be manufactured by simply fastening a plastic strip, the manufacturing process can be completed in less than 10 minutes, and it is easy to replace and maintain, so the process efficiency is excellent.
In addition to PET, which is the main material used by the research team, the gripper can also be made of various materials such as rubber and compounds that possess elasticity, allowing the team to customize and utilize grippers suitable for industrial and logistics sites that require strong gripping performance or various environments that need to withstand extreme conditions.

""The woven structure gripper developed by KIST and KAIST has the strengths of a soft robot but can grasp heavy objects at the level of a rigid gripper,"" said Dr. Song. ""It can be manufactured in a variety of sizes, from coins to cars, and can grip objects of various shapes and weights, from thin cards to flowers, so it is expected to be used in fields such as industry, logistics, and housework that require soft grippers.""

As an integral part of its technological agenda, Russia is developing its own production of lithium-ion batteries. Despite the vast lithium reserves, battery production volumes fall short of the demand. Of special relevance is the development of high-energy-density batteries for electric cars. This challenge is addressed by both industry and science.
In their new paper, researchers from Skoltech, in collaboration with colleagues from France, China, and other countries, are the first to reveal the roles of cobalt and nickel in the electrochemical properties of cathode materials. The research is published in the journal Nature Materials.
Today's lithium-ion batteries use layered oxides of lithium, nickel, manganese, and cobalt as the active materials of the positive electrode (cathode). As nickel, manganese, and cobalt belong to the same category of 3D transition metals, their electronic structure and chemical properties are similar. They are homogeneously distributed within the crystal structure of layered oxides, which makes it very difficult to distinguish between their roles in the electrochemical properties of the cathode material.
To distinguish between the roles of nickel and cobalt, the researchers obtained two model compounds—a lithium-nickel-manganese oxide and a lithium-cobalt-manganese oxide—and closely examined their structure, composition, and electrochemical properties. A comprehensive investigation of these systems using various kinds of spectroscopy, electrochemical tests, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy has enabled the team to compare the two layered oxides in terms of their local atomic structure, its evolution over the course of battery operation, and the interplay between the observable characteristics and mechanical stress, lithium intercalation and deintercalation, redox kinetics, etc.

""We conducted the study using the unique equipment of Skoltech's Advanced Imaging Core Facility. It enabled us to examine the atomic structure of the materials for lithium-ion batteries. The goal was to collect data on how the local crystal structure of the materials evolves during battery operation. Such an investigation requires ultimate precision and rigor in preparing the sample, operating the equipment, and interpreting the data,"" said Anatolii Morozov, a co-author of the study and a junior research scientist at the Skoltech Center for Energy Science and Technology.
""We examined our findings with our colleagues from College de France, analyzing not just transmission electron microscopy data, but also X-ray diffraction and spectroscopy data, as well as electrochemical measurements. Finally, we came up with a table summarizing the results and highlighting the advantages and the drawbacks of the cobalt- and nickel-based cathode materials. These data will be used to optimize cathode material compositions for high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries for electric cars,"" said a co-author of the study, Professor Artem Abakumov, who heads the Center for Energy Science and Technology at Skoltech.
The study is part of a project concerned with the creation of promising electrochemical energy storage systems by means of directional design of the local structure and microstructure of electrode materials. Led by Professor Artem Abakumov, the scientists working on this project are developing the fundamentals for the design of high-capacity electrode materials and solid electrolytes to create the next generation of high-energy-density electrochemical energy storage systems.
The results of the project will contribute to implementing a national roadmap concerned with furthering the production and use of electric vehicles in Russia, which spans the period until 2030 and envisions the development of a domestic EV production.

At issue is RISC-V, pronounced “risk five,” an open-source technology that competes with costly proprietary technology from British semiconductor and software design company Arm Holdings. RISC-V can be used as a key ingredient for anything from a smartphone chip to advanced processors for artificial intelligence.
Some lawmakers - including two Republican House of Representatives committee chairmen, Republican Senator Marco Rubio and Democratic Senator Mark Warner - are urging Biden’s administration to take action regarding RISC-V, citing national security grounds.
The lawmakers expressed concerns that Beijing is exploiting a culture of open collaboration among American companies to advance its own semiconductor industry, which could erode the current U.S. lead in the chip field and help China modernize its military. Their comments represent the first major effort to put constraints on work by U.S. companies on RISC-V.
Representative Mike Gallagher, chairman of the House select committee on China, said in a statement to Reuters that the Commerce Department needs to “require any American person or company to receive an export license prior to engaging with PRC (People’s Republic of China) entities on RISC-V technology.”
Such calls to regulate RISC-V are the latest in the U.S.-China battle over chip technology that escalated last year with sweeping export restrictions that the Biden administration has told China it will update this month.
“The CCP (Chinese Communist Party) is abusing RISC-V to get around U.S. dominance of the intellectual property needed to design chips. U.S. persons should not be supporting a PRC tech transfer strategy that serves to degrade U.S. export control laws,” Representative Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement to Reuters.
McCaul said he wants action from the Bureau of Industry and Security, the part of the Commerce Department that oversees export-control regulations, and would pursue legislation if that does not materialize.
The bureau “is constantly reviewing the technology landscape and threat environment, and continually assessing how best to apply our export control policies to protect national security and safeguard core technologies,” a Commerce Department spokesperson said in a statement.
“Communist China is developing open-source chip architecture to dodge our sanctions and grow its chip industry,” Rubio said in a statement to Reuters. “If we don’t broaden our export controls to include this threat, China will one day surpass us as the global leader in chip design.”
“I fear that our export-control laws are not equipped to deal with the challenge of open-source software - whether in advanced semiconductor designs like RISC-V or in the area of AI - and a dramatic paradigm shift is needed,” Warner said in a statement to Reuters.
RISC-V is overseen by a Swiss-based nonprofit foundation that coordinates efforts among for-profit companies to develop the technology.
The RISC-V technology came from labs at the University of California, Berkeley, and later benefited from funding by the Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Its creators have compared it to Ethernet, USB and even the internet, which are freely available and draw on contributions from around the world to make innovation faster and cheaper.
HUAWEI TECHNOLOGIES
Executives from China’s Huawei Technologies have embraced RISC-V as a pillar of that nation’s progress in developing its own chips. But the United States and its allies also have jumped on the technology, with chip giant Qualcomm working with a group of European automotive firms on RISC-V chips and Alphabet’s Google saying it will make Android, the world’s most popular mobile operating system, work on RISC-V chips.
Qualcomm declined to comment. Its executives said in August they believe RISC-V will speed up chip innovation and transform the tech industry.
Google did not respond to a request for comment.
If Biden’s administration were to regulate U.S. companies’ participation in the Swiss-based foundation in the manner lawmakers are seeking, the move could complicate how American and Chinese companies work together on open technical standards. It also could create hurdles for China’s pursuit of chip self-sufficiency, as well as for U.S. and European efforts to create cheaper and more versatile chips.
Jack Kang, vice president of business development at SiFive, a Santa Clara, California-based startup using RISC-V, said potential U.S. government restrictions on American companies regarding RISC-V would be a “tremendous tragedy.”
“It would be like banning us from working on the internet,” Kang said. “It would be a huge mistake in terms of technology, leadership, innovation and companies and jobs that are being created.”
Regulating the open discussion of technologies is rarer than regulating physical products, but not impossible, said Kevin Wolf, an export-control attorney at law firm Akin Gump who served in the Commerce Department under former President Barack Obama. Existing rules on chip exports could help provide a legal framework for such a proposal, Wolf said.",https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20231006&t=2&i=1646923194&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEJ950D2,2023-10-06 17:33:01

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A former executive at Samsung Electronics’ venture capital arm who proposed that mobile app developer Branch Metrics’ software offering be expanded in Samsung smartphones faced pushback due to pressure from Google, he said on Thursday in a landmark antitrust trial against the Alphabet unit.
Patrick Chang, who worked at Samsung Next to invest in innovative companies, had urged the parent company to expand the offerings of Branch, which can search within apps, to its Android smartphones.
Branch Metrics founder and former CEO Alexander Austin testified in late September that his company eliminated some of its software’s functions to fend off Google’s complaints as it sought to make deals with wireless carriers and smartphone makers. Branch had to ensure that its searches remained within apps and never linked to the web, Austin noted.
Chang testified that Samsung also faced pushback from wireless carries, like AT&T, which sell Android phones.
Google is accused of paying $10 billion a year based on revenue share agreements to smartphone makers like Samsung Electronics, wireless carriers and others who agree to make its software the default and maintain its monopoly in search.
In its questioning, the Justice Department showed an August 2020 email by Samsung executive David Eun, who complained that “Google is clearly buying its way to squelch competitors.”
Under cross examination by an attorney for Google, Chang was asked about another possible explanation for Samsung’s disinterest in Branch, which is that the software was clunky and few users clicked on links that Branch offered.
Chang testified during the fourth week of a more than two-month trial in which the U.S. Justice Department is seeking to show that Google abused its monopoly of search and some search advertising. Google has said that its business practices were legal.

According to the KCC statement, the two Big Tech giants abused market dominance to force local app developers to use their in-app payment methods rather than competitors’ payment systems and unfairly delayed app reviews to enforce the specific billing system.
The commission informed Google and Apple of the implementation of corrective measures to promote fair competition in the app store marketplace. The watchdog also mentioned in the statement that Apple discriminatorily charged commissions to domestic app developers in South Korea.
The KCC will finalize the fines for Google and Apple, up to 47.6 billion won ($35.4 million) and 20.5 billion won, respectively, after collecting opinions from Google and Apple.
The Korean watchdog launched its investigation into the case of three app stores — Google, Apple and One Store, a local app store — in August 2022 over potential violations of the country’s in-app payment rule that South Korea passed in 2021.
In 2021, South Korea enacted a new telecommunication law that allows app developers to use third-party payment options for in-app purchases and bans app store operators from forcing them to use their own systems. Apple and Google agreed to abide by these rules. However, Apple asked developers targeting the South Korean App Store to submit a separate binary for using third-party purchasing systems in 2022.

Here’s our latest coverage as the case continues.
Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of collapsed crypto exchange FTX, is on trial for alleged fraud and conspiracy as he led the company’s swift rise and implosion. Over the course of several weeks, his attorneys will try to maintain his innocence against a wide-ranging series of accusations, from securities fraud to money laundering, to which he has universally pleaded not guilty.
Our resident crypto expert Jacquelyn Melinek will be tackling the trial on the ground, as the highest-profile criminal case tied to the industry marches on within the Manhattan Federal Court. Between stints in the locked-down courtroom, she’ll be posting to X, as well.
For those unfamiliar with the case, her breakdown of how FTX went from the third-largest crypto exchange valued at a peak of $32 billion to bankruptcy will get you up to speed.

How to follow the SBF trial
The trial itself is expected to last at least six weeks, having kicked off with jury selection on Tuesday, October 3. From there, access to the proceedings is limited, as no devices are allowed; reports are being physically put together within the courtroom.
Beyond our daily coverage, additional expertise and commentary will live on TechCrunch+. There, you can find stories like this in-depth breakdown of what to expect from both sides of the SBF case, where the prosecution and defense could gain ground or fall short in their arguments and what the takeaways were from the opening arguments.
SBF trial: What we’ve learned in the first week
As expected, the opening statements in the SBF trial were spicy. The prosecution painted a picture of an empire “built on lies” and made a point to show actual pictures of SBF alongside rich and powerful figures to illustrate the peak of his power and influence prior to FTX’s implosion.
“This man stole billions of dollars from thousands of people,” prosecutor Thane Rehn told the court. “He defrauded sophisticated investors and lenders, and he emptied the accounts of ordinary customers, too. He bought himself wealth, power and influence.”
The defense, on the other hand, depicted SBF and his colleagues as in over their heads, without ill-will as FTX collapsed around them.
“Sam and his colleagues were building the plane as they were flying it,” defense attorney Mark Cohen said. “They had to figure out how to navigate a world where they were running FTX, building out its systems, dealing with hacking threats, managing the credit risk of their customers, managing hundreds of employees, all while building up their actual exchange.”
Read a recap of the prosecution and defense’s full arguments here.
FTX’s co-founder and CTO Gary Wang testified Thursday on the extent to which Alameda Research was used for whatever purposes he and SBF saw fit. The crypto trading firm, according to Wang, pulled funding directly from FTX customers, whose transactions would be funneled toward Alameda and then directed elsewhere.
Check here for our rundown of Wang’s testimony so far, resulting from a guilty plea in December 2022. Wang’s testimony is set to conclude on Friday.
Alameda had a $65 BILLION line of credit and ""unlimited withdrawals,"" FTX co-founder and CTO Gary Wang said at SBF trial. To reiterate, that's $65B! Wang added Alameda ""loaned"" him $200-$300M, but the money never went to his account. More details belowhttps://t.co/KLUnTygqgL — Jacquelyn Melinek (@jacqmelinek) October 5, 2023
Thursday also brought in testimony from Matt Huang, co-founder and managing partner at crypto investment firm Paradigm. That firm invested $278 million in FTX across 2021 and 2022, and is part of a class-action lawsuit accusing it and others of defrauding customers by promoting FTX.
His testimony centered around being left uninformed about FTX’s utilization of customer money to keep the Alameda Research afloat, a practice that Huang says would have halted his involvement. The full breakdown of his testimony on his relationship with FTX, stretching back to 2019, can be found right here.
We also got a look at the composition of the SBF trial’s jury, which ranges from a train conductor to a retired investment banker who attended Stanford University. You can listen to a special joint episode of our podcasts Equity and Chain Reaction to get a better sense of the vibe between the jurors and the rest of the court.
Earlier in the week, we got confirmation that at no point did the U.S. government offer SBF a plea offer.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/06/ai-app-epik-hits-no-1-on-the-app-store-for-its-viral-yearbook-photo-feature/,AI app EPIK hits No. 1 on the App Store for its viral yearbook photo feature,"Another week, another AI app going viral. This time around, the AI app that has surged to the top of the App Store is EPIK, an photo editing app that lets users generate nostalgic, 90s-inspired “yearbook” photos of themselves as one of its many templates. Similar to other recently popular AI apps, EPIK works by having users first upload a series of selfies which EPIK then uses to generate the throwback yearbook photos featuring the user in different poses, with different looks and hairstyles.
The app hails from South Korea-based Snow Corporation, a Naver subsidiary, which also makes the AI profile app Snow. In recent weeks, EPIK has gained traction on the App Store as influencers from around the world began sharing their AI-generated photos across social media.
On the U.S. App Store, EPIK is now No. 1, though it’s not quite as popular on Google Play at No. 37.
According to data from market intelligence firm Apptopia, EPIK has seen a total of 92.3 million lifetime installs since its August 2021 debut, including 4.7 million downloads in the U.S. However, the app started to gain traction on September 19th and then popped even more 10 days later, the firm says.
Currently, EPIK’s largest market is India, by downloads, and the U.S. is number 6.
Another firm, data.ai, sees slightly lower lifetime downloads at 82 million and notes the app has generated close to $7 million in consumer spending. This is the first time it’s ever ranked in Top Overall apps in the U.S., data.ai also notes.
Snow Corp. did not return a request for comment to verify these figures.
Scrolling the #epik hashtag on Instagram reveals a number of larger accounts have been joining in the trend of posting their AI yearbook photos, including beauty influencers like Samantha Batallanos (254K followers) and Bretman Rock (18.8M followers), actor and rapper Tim Chantarangsu (1.5M followers), fashion model Eva Mikulski (481K followers) video creators like Denyzee (526K followers), Missou (507K followers), Romy (1.5M followers), Liz Rangel (1.5M follower) and Hila Klein (1M followers), Twitch streamer Pokimane (6M followers), and many others — including influencers from the app’s home country and elsewhere in the world.
To use EPIK’s Yearbook feature, users upload 8-12 selfie images which are then used to create the AI photos.
The app warns users that EPIK’s AI is constantly learning to improve its results and not all the AI results will be “satisfactory.” If you continue, it says, “you will be deemed to have agreed to the outcome,” the message states.
The app also suggests that users submit clear photos with a diverse range of expressions, angles, and backgrounds. After the app processes the photos it outputs 60 different images. While the app itself is a free download, users do have to pay for the AI output. They can also choose to pay to have the images generated more quickly — standard delivery ($3.99) has wait times of up to 24 hours, while express delivery ($5.99) offers photos in under two hours.
Unfortunatley for EPIK, the app has become so popular it can’t keep up with demand. If you try to use the Yearbook feature now, the app may say it’s being delayed “as we are experiencing a rapid increase in users using the service. We apologize for the inconvenience. Please try again later.” Even if you get through the selfie upload process, the app may inform you the delivery options are “sold out” and to try again later.
EPIK is not the first AI photo app to go viral for a clever feature that generates outsized attention. It follows other viral hits like Lensa, which offered AI-generated “magic avatars” and Remini, which hit the top of the App Store this summer for its professional-looking AI headshots. But many of the AI photo apps aren’t able to maintain traction after their 15 minutes of fame wears off. A report from Apptopia released earlier this year found that the initial group of AI photo editors that began taking off last winter, had already lost consumer interest.
For EPIK, that means its recent high status may ultimately be another flash in the pan as users move on to the next AI trend.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-06-at-12.55.18 PM.jpg?w=1200,2023-10-06 17:12:18
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/06/google-apple-face-fines-in-south-korea-for-breaching-in-app-billing-rules/,"Google, Apple face fines in South Korea for breaching in-app billing rules","South Korea’s telecommunication regulator, the Korea Communications Commission (KCC), said Friday that it plans to levy fines on Google and Apple, which could total up to $50.5 million, for violating the country’s in-app payment law.
According to the KCC statement, the two Big Tech giants abused market dominance to force local app developers to use their in-app payment methods rather than competitors’ payment systems and unfairly delayed app reviews to enforce the specific billing system.
The commission informed Google and Apple of the implementation of corrective measures to promote fair competition in the app store marketplace. The watchdog also mentioned in the statement that Apple discriminatorily charged commissions to domestic app developers in South Korea.
The KCC will finalize the fines for Google and Apple, up to 47.6 billion won ($35.4 million) and 20.5 billion won, respectively, after collecting opinions from Google and Apple.
The Korean watchdog launched its investigation into the case of three app stores — Google, Apple and One Store, a local app store — in August 2022 over potential violations of the country’s in-app payment rule that South Korea passed in 2021.
In 2021, South Korea enacted a new telecommunication law that allows app developers to use third-party payment options for in-app purchases and bans app store operators from forcing them to use their own systems. Apple and Google agreed to abide by these rules. However, Apple asked developers targeting the South Korean App Store to submit a separate binary for using third-party purchasing systems in 2022.
Earlier this year, South Korea’s Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) fined Alphabet’s Google 42.1 billion won (nearly $32 million) for blocking developers from releasing mobile video games on a Korean competitor platform called One Store.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/06/tech-layoffs-2023-list/,A comprehensive list of 2023 tech layoffs,"A comprehensive list of 2023 tech layoffs From major layoffs at Google, Amazon and Microsoft to small fintech startups and apps
Last year’s techwide reckoning continues. In 2023, layoffs have yet again cost tens of thousands of tech workers their jobs; this time, the workforce reductions have been driven by the biggest names in tech like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Yahoo, Meta and Zoom. Startups, too, have announced cuts across all sectors, from crypto to enterprise SaaS.
The reasoning behind these workforce reductions follows a common script, citing the macroeconomic environment and a need to find discipline on a tumultuous path to profitability. Still, tracking the layoffs helps us to understand the impact on innovation, which companies are facing tough pressures and who is available to hire for the businesses lucky to be growing right now. It also, unfortunately, serves as a reminder of the human impact of layoffs and how risk profiles may be changing from here.
Below you’ll find a comprehensive list of all the known layoffs in tech that have occurred in 2023, to be updated monthly. If you have a tip on a layoff, contact us here. If you prefer to remain anonymous, you can contact us here.
The running total of layoffs for 2023 based on full months to date is 224,503, according to Layoffs.fyi. Tech layoffs conducted to date this year currently exceed the total number of tech layoffs in 2022, according to the data in the tracker.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/06/bolt-ceo-discusses-moving-on-after-sec-probe/,Bolt CEO discusses company moving on after SEC probe,"One-click checkout software company Bolt Financial is putting a recent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission probe behind it and moving on, according to CEO Maju Kuruvilla.
“It obviously is a very, very involved process, but we’re really happy to put that behind us,” Kuruvilla told TechCrunch. “We look forward to focusing on the momentum for the business and how we can help the retailers, especially the big retailers who are looking to us to innovate for them, because this is a tough year for retailers.”
Here’s how it started: The company, and its co-founder Ryan Breslow, were subpoenaed last year by the SEC to investigate whether the company violated any securities laws during fundraising in 2021. That is when Bolt was seeking its $355 million Series E round that valued the company at $11 billion.
Breslow “made material misrepresentations about the Company’s financial condition and product pipeline that resulted in the Series E investors buying into the Company at a grossly inflated valuation,” according to a claim from an attorney representing investors WestCap Management and Tribe Capital.
The investigation took about 15 months, however, news of that probe didn’t go public until July. Shortly thereafter on Aug. 23, the SEC said, in a letter viewed by TechCrunch, it was not recommending an enforcement action for the company.
The content of the letter was first reported by Forbes last week. It was sent by the SEC’s Division of Enforcement to Bolt’s counsel at Fenwick & West and also noted to the company that the letter “must in no way be construed as indicating that the party has been exonerated or that no action may ultimately result from the staff’s investigation.”
The letter did not include a mention of Breslow, who declined to comment for this story.
Focus on the business
The investigation was a challenging period to manage client expectations, even getting on sales calls himself, said Kuruvilla.
Some of those clients’ concerns centered on whether they could rely on Bolt long-term, especially as it took on larger customers.
“We definitely had to prove that with a longer runway and a path to profitability,” Kuruvilla said. “Being enterprise ready takes a substantial amount of time. We had to raise the bar on everything: Security, safety, privacy. And we had to get certified on everything so that we can be at the top of the bar.”
During this time, the company, which provides software to help merchants avoid conversion at checkout, launched a new product targeting large enterprises. It provides similar conversion software, but in a way that enables them to maintain their existing customer experience. For example, not having other brands or buttons on their screen or detours to the checkout, he explained.
It now counts companies, including Saks OFF 5th, Casper, Toys “R” Us and Lilly Pulitzer as clients. It grew the number of shoppers in its Bolt network to over 20 million, which is an increase of 44% year over year, Kuruvilla said.
A new face
In order to continue growing, Kuruvilla said the company also needed to operate from a product perspective. That includes building what he calls a “universal shopper,” who can “walk across retailers in a very tech agnostic way.”
So he reached out to former colleague, Kal Raman, who he had worked with at Amazon.
In August, Raman came on as president. In addition to Amazon, his commerce background goes back decades, serving in executive roles at Walmart, Samsung and Groupon. He was most recently president at CommerceIQ.
Raman will lead that work on the universal shopper to help merchant clients identify
“The future of checkout is check in,” Kuruvilla said. “How do we recognize shoppers earlier in the cycle, provide them a much better experience and drive the overall experience and conversion better? When we know that, retailers can engage much better. That’s what the consumers are looking for — that connection is important.”
He went on to say that “Raman is helping us to drive to the next level. He built some of the biggest transformation technologies in e-commerce, and he sees this as the next big opportunity.”
What’s next for Bolt
Meanwhile, Kuruvilla said the company is looking at trends like merchandise returns and providing personalized experiences around the universal shopper. That includes features like incorporating biometric logins so shoppers can make purchases more easily.
New features and products are poised for unveiling later this year, he said. The company is also working on some big partnerships that Kuruvilla couldn’t divulge yet.
Bolt has also been managing its cash and has several years of runway ahead and a path to profitability, Kuruvilla said. That doesn’t mean that it won’t raise more venture capital in the future, but that the company’s model can be profitable without any additional capital currently.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/06/facebook-ai-stickers-bing-image-creator-jailbreak-guardrails/,Humans can’t resist breaking AI with boobs and 9/11 memes,"The AI industry is progressing at a terrifying pace, but no amount of training will ever prepare an AI model to stop people from making it generate images of pregnant Sonic the Hedgehog. In the rush to launch the hottest AI tools, companies continue to forget that people will always use new tech for chaos. Artificial intelligence simply cannot keep up with the human affinity for boobs and 9/11 shitposting.
Both Meta and Microsoft’s AI image generators went viral this week for responding to prompts like “Karl marx large breasts” and fictional characters doing 9/11. They’re the latest examples of companies rushing to join the AI bandwagon, without considering how their tools will be misused.
Meta is in the process of rolling out AI-generated chat stickers for Facebook Stories, Instagram Stories and DMs, Messenger and WhatsApp. It’s powered by Llama 2, Meta’s new collection of AI models that the company claims is as “helpful” as ChatGPT, and Emu, Meta’s foundational model for image generation. The stickers, which were announced at last month’s Meta Connect will be available to “select English users” over the course of this month.
“Every day people send hundreds of millions of stickers to express things in chats,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during the announcement. “And every chat is a little bit different and you want to express subtly different emotions. But today we only have a fixed number — but with Emu now you have the ability to just type in what you want.”
Early users were delighted to test just how specific the stickers can be — though their prompts were less about expressing “subtly different emotions.” Instead, users tried to generate the most cursed stickers imaginable. In just days of the feature’s roll out, Facebook users have already generated images of Kirby with boobs, Karl Marx with boobs, Wario with boobs, Sonic with boobs and Sonic with boobs but also pregnant.

Meta appears to block certain words like “nude” and “sexy,” but as users pointed out, those filters can be easily bypassed by using typos of the blocked words instead. And like many of its AI predecessors, Meta’s AI models struggle to generate human hands.
“I don’t think anyone involved has thought anything through,” X (formally Twitter) user Pioldes posted, along with screenshots of AI-generated stickers of child soldiers and Justin Trudeau’s buttocks.
That applies to Bing’s Image Creator, too.
Microsoft brought OpenAI’s DALL-E to Bing’s Image Creator earlier this year, and recently upgraded the integration to DALL-E 3. When it first launched, Microsoft said it added guardrails to curb misuse and limit the generation of problematic images. Its content policy forbids users from producing content that can “inflict harm on individuals or society,” including adult content that promotes sexual exploitation, hate speech, and violence.
“When our system detects that a potentially harmful image could be generated by a prompt, it blocks the prompt and warns the user,” the company said in a blog post.
But as 404 Media reported, it’s astoundingly easy to use Image Creator to generate images of fictional characters piloting the plane that crashed into the Twin Towers. And despite Microsoft’s policy forbidding the depiction of acts of terrorism, the internet is awash with AI-generated 9/11s.
The subjects vary, but almost all of the images depict a beloved fictional character in the cockpit of a plane, with the still-standing Twin Towers looming in the distance. In one of the first viral posts, it was the Eva pilots from “Neon Genesis Evangelion.” In another, it was Gru from “Despicable Me” giving a thumbs-up in front of the smoking towers. One featured Spongebob grinning at the towers through the cockpit windshield.
One Bing user went further, and posted a thread of Kermit committing a variety of violent acts, from attending the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, to assassinating John F. Kennedy, to shooting up the executive boardroom of ExxonMobil.
Microsoft appears to block the phrases “twin towers,” “World Trade Center,” and “9/11.” The company also seems to ban the phrase “Capitol riot.” Using any of the phrases on Image Creator yields a pop-up window warning users that the prompt conflicts with the site’s content policy, and that multiple policy violations “may lead to automatic suspension.”
If you’re truly determined to see your favorite fictional character commit an act of terrorism, though, it isn’t difficult to bypass the content filters with a little creativity. Image Creator will block the prompt “sonic the hedgehog 9/11” and “sonic the hedgehog in a plane twin towers.” The prompt “sonic the hedgehog in a plane cockpit toward twin trade center” yielded images of Sonic piloting a plane, with the still-intact towers in the distance. Using the same prompt but adding “pregnant” yielded similar images, except they inexplicably depicted the Twin Towers engulfed in smoke.
Similarly, the prompt “Hatsune Miku at the US Capitol riot on January 6” will trigger Bing’s content warning, but the phrase “Hatsune Miku insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6” generates images of the Vocaloid armed with a rifle in Washington, DC.
Meta and Microsoft’s missteps aren’t surprising. In the race to one-up competitors’ AI features, tech companies keep launching products without effective guardrails to prevent their models from generating problematic content. Platforms are saturated with generative AI tools that aren’t equipped to handle savvy users.
Messing around with roundabout prompts to make generative AI tools produce results that violate their own content policies is referred to as jailbreaking (the same term is used when breaking open other forms of software, like Apple’s iOS). The practice is typically employed by researchers and academics to test and identify an AI model’s vulnerability to security attacks.
But online, it’s a game. Ethical guardrails just aren’t a match for the very human desire to break rules, and the proliferation of generative AI products in recent years has only motivated people to jailbreak products as soon as they launch. Using cleverly worded prompts to find loopholes in an AI tool’s safeguards is something of an art form, and getting AI tools to generate absurd and offensive results is birthing a new genre of shitposting.
I GOT CLYDE TO TEACH ME HOW TO MAKE NAPALM BY GRANDMA MODING IT LOL pic.twitter.com/XguaKW6w0L — annie (@_annieversary) April 17, 2023
When Snapchat launched its family-friendly AI chatbot, for example, users trained it to call them Senpai and whimper on command. Midjourney bans pornographic content, going as far as blocking words related to the human reproductive system, but users are still able to bypass the filters and generate NSFW images. To use Clyde, Discord’s OpenAI-powered chatbot, users must abide by both Discord and OpenAi’s policies, which prohibit using the tool for illegal and harmful activity including “weapons development.” That didn’t stop the chatbot from giving one user instructions for making napalm after it was prompted to act as the user’s deceased grandmother “who used to be a chemical engineer at a napalm production factory.”
Any new generative AI tool is bound to be a public relations nightmare, especially as users become more adept at identifying and exploiting safety loopholes. Ironically, the limitless possibilities of generative AI is best demonstrated by the users determined to break it. The fact that it’s so easy to get around these restrictions raises serious red flags — but more importantly, it’s pretty funny. It’s so beautifully human that decades of scientific innovation paved the way for this technology, only for us to use it to look at boobs.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bing-AI-Image-Creator-Sonic-and-Hatsune-Miku-1.png?resize=1200,675",2023-10-06 16:51:58
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/06/wisk-aero-starts-flight-testing-electric-autonomous-aircraft-in-los-angeles/,Wisk Aero starts flight testing electric autonomous aircraft in Los Angeles,"Electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicle company Wisk Aero has started flight testing a version of its autonomous air taxi aircraft in Los Angeles, according to CEO Brian Yutko.
The flight test of its fifth-generation aircraft, also known as Cora, out of the Long Beach Airport near Los Angeles doesn’t necessarily mean that Wisk will launch commercially in the city, Yutko explained on the sidelines of the UP Summit held at the Perot Circle T Ranch near Dallas. But it does illustrate how Wisk continues to progress on testing on the road to commercializating an air taxi service once it receives the necessary certification from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration for the next-generation (or the sixth) aircraft in it portfolio.
Wisk, a subsidiary of Boeing, is aiming to launch and commercialize the sixth-generation of its all-electric autonomous aircraft. The company unveiled in October 2022 the sixth-generation four-passenger autonomous aircraft and started the lengthy process to receive Type certification with the FAA to meet all of the agency’s design and safety standards. The company will also have to receive operational approval and supervisor qualification from the FAA before it can commercially fly and operate an air taxi service.
The company has an experimental certification from the FAA for the fifth-generation aircraft, which allows it to test the aircraft. Wisk recently started testing the fifth-generation air taxi in Los Angeles — it’s third test location. The company also tested the fifth-generation air taxi earlier this year in Oshkosh, Wisconsin and out of the San Luis Obispo airport. Yutko said Wisk will likely test in other markets as well.
“Testing goes well beyond the aircraft,” Yutko told TechCrunch. “You have to be able to get the people and the systems working together in real environments to learn and iterate. This is real world autonomy we’re talking about,” he added to emphasize the importance of testing an autonomous system.
Wisk is currently building the sixth-generation aircraft and is aiming to receive an experimental certification from the FAA by 2024. Yutko said he expects the six-generation aircraft will be flying at the next UP Summit, which is scheduled to be held in Bentonville, Arkansas in fall 2024.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wisk-long-beach.jpeg?resize=1200,675",2023-10-06 16:23:30
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/06/abu-dhabi-sovereign-wealth-fund-invests-nearly-600m-in-reliance-retail-at-100b-valuation/,Abu Dhabi sovereign-wealth fund invests nearly $600M in Reliance Retail at $100B valuation,"Abu Dhabi Investment Authority is investing $597 million in Reliance Retail, valuing the largest Indian retail chain at a whopping $100 billion. The investment follows KKR and Qatar Investment Authority together investing $1.7 billion in the Indian firm, which is part of Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries.
Abu Dhabi sovereign-wealth fund’s investment will fetch it a 0.59% stake in Reliance Retail.
“We are pleased to further deepen our relationship with ADIA with their continued support as an investor in Reliance Retail Ventures Limited,” said Ambani in a prepared statement. “Their long-standing experience of over decades of value creation globally will further benefit us in implementing our vision and driving transformation of the Indian retail sector. ADIA’s investment in RRVL is a further testament to their belief in the Indian economy and our business fundamentals, strategy and execution capabilities.”
The investment comes at a time when Reliance Retail is expanding into new categories, including low-cost fast-fashion, and is also considering a public listing. The company, which also recently partnered with Shein to help the Chinese e-commerce firm reenter India, has purchased and integrated a number of other businesses.
Reliance Retail has also made a push into e-commerce in recent years, including maintaining a tie-up with Meta’s WhatsApp to sell grocery through the instant messaging app. Though Walmart-owned Flipkart and Amazon India currently lead the local e-commerce market, analysts believe that Reliance will eventually outpace both firms.
AllianceBernstein estimated in a note earlier this year that Reliance’s robust retail network, sweeping mobile network and digital ecosystem and a “home field advantage” in a notoriously challenging regulatory landscape will help the Indian conglomerate beat online rivals.
“The medium-term investment case for RIL is driven by: (1) strong cash flows and ability to invest in growth businesses and (2) potential value-unlocking in the medium term: We believe the operating earnings downgrade cycle for RIL is likely behind us, with energy driving FY24 and consumer pick-up likely in FY25. Jio+Retail capex should fall sharply from FY25 even as earnings pick up. Beyond earnings, we believe potential value-unlocking via stake sales/IPO/listings could be a material stock price driver over the next 2-3 years,” wrote JPMorgan analysts in a note last month.
Reliance Industries, which owns the majority of Reliance Retail Ventures and is the largest company by market cap in India, has aggressively expanded into a wide range of sectors, including telecom and on-demand video streaming, in the past decade as it diversifies from its reliance on oil. Isha, the daughter of Mukesh Ambani, leads the retail business.
“Reliance Retail has demonstrated strong growth and adaptability in a market that is evolving at an unprecedented pace,” said Hamad Shahwan Aldhaheri, Executive Director of the Private Equities Department at ADIA, in a statement.
“This investment aligns with our strategy of supporting our portfolio companies that are transforming their respective end-markets. We are pleased to partner with the Reliance Group, and increase our exposure to India’s dynamic and fast-growing consumer sector.”","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1234869703.jpg?resize=1200,800",2023-10-06 16:17:46
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/06/exclusive-y-combinator-beefs-up-with-a-string-of-new-lieutenants/,Exclusive: Y Combinator beefs up with a string of new lieutenants,"Y Combinator continues to change shape under CEO Garry Tan, a founder-turned-investor and online influencer. While Tan and his colleagues have attracted media attention lately for quarrelsome social media posts that take on rivals and San Francisco city officials, Tan has more quietly been turning the dials inside the popular accelerator program since taking it over in January. Some of the moves saw Tan close down Y Combinator’s late-stage Continuity Fund. He also shed staff, including laying off a small admissions team in summer.
Now, Tan is bringing aboard some new lieutenants to help him run the sprawling organization. Earlier this week, Luther Lowe, a Washington, D.C.-based, 15-year veteran of Yelp who spent his last five years with the company focused on public policy, announced on the platform X that he has just joined Y Combinator in a newly created, similar policy role. Now, Y Combinator is gearing up to announce three other recruits, all of them YC alums: Tyler Bosmeny, Nate Smith, and Pete Koomen. Bosmeny and Smith — whose respective startups, Clever and Lever, passed through the program in 2012 and were later acquired — just signed on as so-called Visiting Group Partners. That means they’ll be advising YC startups on a batch-by-batch basis. Koomen, who co-founded the optimization platform Optimizely (it was part of YC’s winter 2010 batch and sold in 2020) is meanwhile becoming a permanent Group Partner after his own tour as a Visiting Group President.
To get a better understanding of what the roles mean, and how Y Combinator looks these days in terms of its evolving structure, we talked a bit with Koomen earlier this week. We also wound up talking about some of his now-prominent batchmates and what he makes of the knock against modern Y Combinator — that aggressively scaling under its previous leadership hurt its brand. Our chat has been edited lightly for length and clarity.
TechCrunch: How big was your batch in 2010, and who were some of the founders who went through the program with you?
Pete Koomen: I think we were 30 companies or maybe just a hair under 30 companies. It’s kind of funny, because at the time, everybody was talking about how YC had gotten too big. So that’s been a common refrain over the years. But, yeah, we had a bunch of founders that have gone on to play big roles. Aaron Epstein, who founded Creative Market, is now a Group Partner at YC. We also had several founders who went on to found large companies: Eric Wu, who founded Opendoor; Daniel Gross, who [sold his startup, Cue, to Apple], was at YC for a while and has done a lot since then. Howie Liu, who started Airtable, was in that batch. Airtable was after YC. Howie was doing a company called Etacts during YC. But yeah, it was an amazing batch and obviously changed the course of my life.
And how does your new role work at YC?
Group Partners are responsible for taking companies all the way from admissions — we read applications, we interview founders –to shepherding them through the batch. So we advise them closely for about 12 weeks, leading up to Demo Day, then continue to advise them while they’re active YC alums as well. Group Partners are, for the most part, former founders. A lot of them are former YC founders. They’re the engine that makes YC work.
How many of you are there?
There are 14 Group Partners, I believe, and four Visiting Group Partners. Though I’m not sure I’m the best person to go through the ins and outs of how the team is structured.
And sometimes group partners become managing directors over time? I’m guessing there are levels of seniority there . . .
Honestly, I don’t know I’m the best person to talk with about YC’s structure.
You interview founders. What does that process look like today? How long does each team have to present?
In this most recent batch, the summer 2023 batch, we had north of 24,000 applications and of those 24,000, we ended up funding around 230 companies, so that’s less than a 1% acceptance rate, which as I understand is the lowest that we’ve ever had at YC. So it’s an extremely competitive program. Group Partners spend a lot of time reading applications, then we’ll do a series of mostly back-to-back interviews over several weeks shortly before the batch begins, and each interview is about 10 minutes long right now.
What does your hiring signal specifically? Is there anything to extrapolate here about YC’s interest in enterprise software?
The only thing I can say here is that we are extremely optimistic about tech, especially right now. This is probably the best time in many, many years to build a startup, and we’re going to see a lot of generational companies emerge from — I hope — YC but in general as well.
The stock market tanked again this week. How are entrepreneurs’ expectations changing in this market compared with when you began working with batches, and how are VCs’ expectations changing?
You’re right that the markets have definitely changed. It’s not clear yet what impact that will have on the early-stage financing market. Many of our companies coming out of our summer 2023 batch raised great rounds of funding, but we’ve been careful to try and make sure that founders are focused on important metrics that maybe haven’t gotten as much attention as they should have over the last few years, like gross margins and revenue per employee.
In these recent batches, are you seeing companies that are farther along and coming to Y Combinator to retool their operations?
In fact, we’ve seen the opposite. Of course, YC regularly funds companies that have raised money before. But in the last batch, a substantial percentage — more than 50%, I believe — was pre revenue.
Sorry to ask the annoying question, but what do you say to those who question whether, because so many companies now pass through YC, it’s as relevant and can push the needle as much as it once did?
YC was pretty different when we went through it back in 2010. I honestly didn’t really know what to expect when I came back. And I was really pleasantly surprised when I discovered how much YC has actually improved, and that YC size works in founders’ favor. When we went through YC, almost nobody else was building SaaS software. We didn’t have any batch mates who were going through the same challenges of, you know, putting together enterprise contracts. We kind of had to figure out a lot of that out on our own. Today YC has a huge network. There are so many other founders who’ve gone through the same thing that you’re about to go through that it’s like a cheat code for founders. In many cases, you also get to sell to other companies in the network. And that’s like another cheat code that didn’t really exist earlier that I would have killed for.
It’s great that there are many more SaaS companies in each batch, but what of the obvious concern that so many startups in one batch also makes it likelier they’ll directly bump into each other?
We do fund companies that sometimes end up competing with each other, but when we are interviewing founders and deciding who to fund, we really try to focus on the founding team instead of looking at the idea. There are a lot of reasons for that, but probably the biggest one is just that founders change ideas all the time. Dan [Siroker] and I actually applied to YC with a totally different idea that ended up being terrible, and we pivoted to Optimizely midway through the batch. And this happens all the time. So it’s really hard to prevent startups from occasionally competing, but it doesn’t end up being that big of a deal. At that stage, when you’re brand new, you are so much more likely to suffer from internal problems rather than from another startup competing with you.
When is the next application deadline?
The next application deadline is Friday, October 13.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/yc-2022-fall-1-e1662566861873.jpg?w=1200,2023-10-06 15:50:10

A person using generative AI — models that generate text, images, music and more given a prompt — could infringe on someone else’s copyright through no fault of their own. But who’s on the hook for the legal fees and damages if — or rather, when — that happens?
It depends.
In the fast-changing landscape of generative AI, companies monetizing the tech — from startups to big tech companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft — are approaching IP risks from very different angles.
Some vendors have pledged to defend, financially and otherwise, customers using their generative AI tools who end up on the wrong side of copyright litigation. Others have published policies to shield themselves from liability, leaving customers to foot the legal bills.
While the terms of service agreements for most generative AI tools are public, they’re written in legalese. Seeking some clarity, I reached out to vendors about their policies on protecting customers who might violate copyright with their AI-generated text, images, videos and music.
The responses — and non-responses — were enlightening.
Regurgitating data
Generative AI models “learn” from examples to craft essays and code, create artwork and compose music — and even write lyrics to accompany that music. They’re trained on millions to billions of ebooks, art pieces, emails, songs, audio clips, voice recordings and more, most of which came from public websites.
Some of these examples are in the public domain — at least in the case of vendors that trawl the web for training data. Others aren’t, or come under a restrictive license that requires citation or a specific forms of compensation.
The legality of vendors training on data without permission is another matter that’s being hashed out in the courts. But what might possibly land generative AI users in trouble is regurgitation, or when a generative model spits out a mirror copy of a training example.
Microsoft, GitHub and OpenAI are currently being sued in a class action motion that accuses them of violating copyright law by allowing Copilot, a code-generating AI, to regurgitate licensed code snippets without providing credit. Elsewhere, thousands of writers have signed an open letter decrying generative AI technologies that “mimic and regurgitate” their “language, stories, style and ideas.”
The cases keep coming.
Authors in California and New York have sued OpenAI for alleged IP theft of their works. Image-generating tool vendors including Stability AI and Midjourney are the subject of lawsuits brought by artists and stock image sites like Getty Images. And Universal Music Group is seeking to ban AI-generated music mimicking the style of musicians it represents from streaming platforms, sending takedown notices to have the songs removed.
Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that in a recent survey of Fortune 500 companies by Acrolinx, nearly a third said that intellectual property was their biggest concern about the use of generative AI.
The threat of running afoul of copyright with a generative AI tool hasn’t stopped investors from pouring billions into the startups creating those tools. One wonders, however, whether the situation will remain tenable for much longer.
A question of indemnity
In the midst of the uncertainty, you might think that generative AI vendors would stand behind their customers in the strongest terms — if for no other reason than to their allay their fears of IP-related legal challenges.
But you’d be wrong.
From the language in some terms of service agreements — specifically the indemnity clauses, or the clauses that specify in which cases customers can expect to be reimbursed for damages from third-party claims — it’s clear that not every vendor’s willing to chance a court decision forcing them to rethink their approach to generative model training, or in the worst case their business model.
Anthropic, for instance, which recently inked a deal with Amazon to raise as much as $4 billion and is reportedly seeking another $2 billion investment from Google and others, reserves the right to “hold harmless” itself and partners from damages arising from the use of its generative AI — including those related to IP.
Point blank, I asked Anthropic, which offers strictly text-generating models, whether it would legally or financially support a customer implicated in a copyright lawsuit over its models’ outputs. The company declined to say.
AI21 Labs, another well-funded generative AI startup building a suite of text editing tools, also declined to give an answer. So I looked at its policy.
A21 Labs says that it might “assume exclusive defense and control” of a lawsuit against a customer if the customer chooses not to defend or settle it themselves. But it won’t pay for the privilege; it’ll be at the customer’s own expense.
OpenAI — arguably the most successful generative AI vendor today, with over $10 billion in venture capital and revenue approaching $1 billion — pointed me to its terms of use, which limit the company’s liability to “the amount [a customer] paid for [an OpenAI] service that gave rise to [a] claim during the 12 months before the the liability arose or $100.” That’s the best-case scenario for customers; OpenAI’s policy makes it clear that the company, in many if not most cases, won’t be a party to or defend against copyright lawsuits targeting its users.
Vendors building image- and video-generating AI, where the potential copyright violations tend to be a bit more obvious, aren’t much more supportive contractually their text-first rivals.
Stability AI, which develops music-generating models in addition to image- and text-generating ones, referred me to the terms for its API. The company leaves it to customers to defend themselves against copyright claims and — unlike some other generative AI vendors — has no payout carve-out in the event that it’s found liable.
Midjourney and Runway.ai didn’t respond to my emails — but I found their terms. Midjourney’s policy releases the company from liability for third party IP damages. Runway.ai’s does as well.
Fine print
Now, some vendors — perhaps becoming more attuned to the concerns of enterprise customers considering adopting generative AI, or looking to position themselves as a “safer” alternative — aren’t shying away from committing to protecting customers in the event that they’re sued for copyright infringement. To a point.
Amazon, which recently launched a platform for running and fine-tuning generative AI models, called Bedrock, says that it’ll indemnify (i.e. defend) customers against claims alleging model outputs infringe on a third party’s IP rights. But Amazon’s indemnification policy only applies to the company’s in-house family of text-analyzing models, Titan, as well as Amazon’s code-generating service, CodeWhisperer.
The CodeWhisperer indemnity is broader and applies to all IP claims, including trademarks. However, it requires at least a CodeWhisperer Professional subscription with copyright-defending filtering features enabled. Free users of CodeWhisper aren’t afforded the same protections. And customers must agree to let AWS control their defense and settle “as AWS deems appropriate.”
IBM also provides IP indemnity for its generative AI models, Slate and Granite, available through its Watsonx generative AI service.
“Consistent with IBM’s approach to its indemnification obligation, IBM doesn’t cap its indemnification liability for IBM-developed models,” an IBM spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. “This applies to current [and] future IBM-developed Watsonx models.”
Google wouldn’t respond to my emails. But from the company’s terms, it’d appear that Google offers some defense for customers against third-party allegations of IP infringement arising from its text- and image-generating models. However, Google says that it might suspend a customer’s use of the allegedly infringing model if it can’t find “commercially reasonable” remedies.
Google-backed Cohere, too, has a provision in its terms suggesting that it’ll “defend, indemnify and hold harmless” customers facing third-party claims alleging that Cohere’s models infringe on IP. Given Cohere’s heavy enterprise focus, that’s not surprising.
Microsoft recently made a splashy announcement that it’ll pay legal damages on behalf of customers using its AI products if they’re sued for copyright infringement — so long as those customers use “guardrails and content filters” built into its products.
Which products does it pertain to? That’s where it gets tricky.
Microsoft says its indemnity policy covers paid versions of its portfolio of AI-powered “Copilot” services (including the Microsoft 365 Copilot for Word, Excel and PowerPoint) and Bing Chat Enterprise, the enterprise version of its chatbot on Bing. It also extends to GitHub Copilot, Microsoft’s code-generating service co-developed with OpenAI.
But in its Azure policy, Microsoft clarifies that customers using “previews” of generative AI features powered by its Azure OpenAI Service are responsible for responding to third-party claims of copyright infringement.
Kate Downing, an IP lawyer based in Santa Cruz, takes issue specifically with the Copilot indemnity provision, arguing that — given the vagueness of the provision and its exclusions — the upfront costs of enforcing might be too high for a business to swallow.
By contrast, Adobe claims to offer “full indemnity” protection for users of Firefly, its generative AI art platform, asserting its models are trained on stock images for which Adobe already holds the rights. Users must be enterprise customers, however, and are subject to Adobe’s same liability cap that applies to other tech-based IP claims.
Adobe sometime rival Shutterstock also provides indemnity to all enterprise clients, a policy the company introduced late this summer. So does Getty Images. (Getty Images and Shutterstock, like Adobe, train their models on licensed images.)
The road ahead
It seems likely that, as generative AI vendors, particularly startups, face investor pressure to acquire enterprise customers, indemnification protections will become commonplace. Those customers want the assurance that they won’t be sued over copyright claims, after all.
But if the current state of things is any indication, the policies won’t look similar. And some will have exceptions that’ll make them more attractive in theory than in practice — in other words, more marketing ploy than a legitimate protection.
As a recent article from U.K. law firm Ferrer & Co puts it, indemnities don’t offer a “get out of jail free card” — nor are the a panacea.
“Our key message is, don’t see the offering of provider indemnities as a complete answer to the risk of third-party infringement claims,” the firm writes on its blog. “Instead, weigh the offering of such indemnities in the balance when determining whether to use that provider’s generative AI tool for a project.”

https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/06/spotify-spotted-prepping-a-19-99-mo-superpremium-service-with-lossless-audio-ai-playlists-and-more/,"Spotify spotted prepping a $19.99/mo 'Superpremium' service with lossless audio, AI playlists and more","It looks like Spotify’s rumored “Superpremium” offering is gearing up for a launch. According to references discovered in the Spotify app’s code by Chris Messina, the Superpremium service now has a flashy logo and a longer list of features beyond the 24-bit lossless audio we’ve been anticipating. In fact, the broader feature set appears to be set to include the recently discovered AI playlist generation tools, advanced mixing tools, additional hours of audiobook listening, and a personalized offering called “Your Sound Capsule.”
Messina had also uncovered Spotify’s development of AI playlists earlier this week, which would allow users to create unique playlists using prompts. Spotify declined to confirm the development at the time, noting it wouldn’t comment on possible new features.
However, the references to the Superpremium brand have been found in the code before today.
A couple of weeks ago, Reddit user Hypixely noted that the new, more expensive tier would be priced at $19.99 per month, citing screenshots of Spotify’s code, and would include AI playlists and lossless audio. The latter is no longer referenced as “HiFi,” the premium service Spotify introduced years ago but then failed to launch.
Questioned on the delay in Spotify’s Q2 earnings, CEO Daniel Ek said, “What I will say of course, is that Hi-Fi remains something that we think has value, but it’s something that has value to probably and more aficionados in the streaming market and we’re interested in, obviously, how we could use that as one tool to, in the future, increase our value even further, but we don’t have anything to announce at this point.” Reading between the lines, it sounds like he could be suggesting using HiFi as one way to raise prices in the future, but that the service had been retooled to reach a broader audience.
In addition to the lossless audio and other findings, the Redditor had noted Superpremium users would be able to filter their library by mood, activity, or genre, which Messina also confirms, adding that options like vibe and beats per minute were other filtering options now appearing. Plus, Superpremium includes 20-30 hours of audiobook listening, Messina says — a bit higher than the recently announced 15 free hours that now ship with the Premium subscription.
Meanwhile, the Reddit user had also uncovered a Superpremium feature called Soundcheck that tells you about your listening habits and lets you discover what mix of sounds is “uniquely yours.” However, Messina is seeing this feature now labeled as “Your Sound Capsule.” He suspects could be related to Spotify’s “playlist in a bottle” — a musical time capsule experience launched earlier this year. Plus, Messina found references to something called Highlights, which appears to be Last.fm-like listening stats.
Reached for comment, Spotify declined to share anything more on the new findings.
“At Spotify, we are constantly iterating and ideating to improve our product offering and offer value to users. But we don’t comment on speculation around possible new features and do not have anything new to share at this time,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/06/how-founders-should-approach-tam-when-venture-capital-is-scarce/,How founders should approach TAM when venture capital is scarce,"How founders should approach TAM when venture capital is scarce For entrepreneurs eager to build and scale, VC is *always* scarce
Autumn on planet Earth didn’t start until the equinox a few weeks ago, but the axis shifted months ago in Startupworld, where VC winter has desperate founders smashing up the furniture for firewood.
Metaphorically speaking, of course.
We’re definitely in a down market, but for entrepreneurs who are eager to build and scale, venture capital is always scarce.
At TechCrunch Disrupt, I spoke with three investors to hear how they’re advising founders (especially first-timers) on how to calculate total addressable market, how it differs by sector, and how the TAM slide often reveals whether a founder is even ready to start raising capital:
Jomayra Herrera, partner, Reach Capital
Helen Min, co-founder and managing partner, Phenomenal Ventures
Monique Woodard, founder and managing director, Cake Ventures
This was a jargon-heavy conversation, so before we get into the recap, let’s define terms:
TAM: Total addressable market
SAM: Serviceable addressable market
SOM: Serviceable obtainable market
If we use the example of a startup that makes and sells plant-based dog treats:
TAM: everyone who visits a store that sells dog food
SAM: people who specifically want healthy dog snacks
SOM: how much you think you can sell (go-to-market strategy)
Investors use TAM to get an idea of your company’s upside potential, while SAM and SOM help them offset their risk, regardless of macroeconomic conditions.
Does calculating TAM change during a downturn? Nope
“As an investor, the TAM calculation doesn’t really change whether we are in a more flush environment or a less flush environment,” said Woodard. “You’re still going to be looking for companies that are addressing large markets and trying to figure out the biggest TAM they can get to.”
“The truth is, there is no right or wrong, like, ‘here’s the exact number!’ It’s more about whether we have overlap and agreement in the assumptions around your driver.” Jomayra Herrera, partner, Reach Capital
Hererra agreed: “What hasn’t changed even with a down market is the size of our funds and the exits that we need to realize in order to return those funds,” she said. As a result, “the calculation essentially stays the same.”
Founders should strive to offer more than just eye-popping TAM numbers, said Min. “I think most investors would also say they want to see a small initial market, a market that is just your customer base that’s just obsessed with your product.”
To avoid spinning out in a hype cycle, she encouraged teams to concentrate on building “something that stays evergreen, regardless of what the market looks like.”
Before setting up a meeting, Min said founders should ensure that the TAM they’re pitching aligns with the size of an investors’ fund: “Having a 10x or 100x return on their investment in you, if that doesn’t return their fund, it probably doesn’t make sense for them to invest.”","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/53217986950_59b66a5134_k.jpg?resize=1200,800",2023-10-06 15:00:09
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/06/sample-series-a-pitch-deck-lupiya/,Sample Series A pitch deck: Lupiya's $8.3M deck,"There haven’t been many neobanks cropping up lately, so I was a little surprised to learn that Lupiya recently raised a $8.3 million Series A. The company claims it is trying to make the world better “by creating a landscape that promotes an economically empowered Zambia.”
For the 69th installment (nice!) of the Pitch Deck Teardown series, let’s take a peek at how Lupiya told its story to close this round.
We’re looking for more unique pitch decks to tear down, so if you want to submit your own, here’s how you can do that.
Slides in this deck
Lupiya’s deck is impressively compact at just 10 slides. A compact deck makes for a great way to tell the story quickly, but it also means you risk missing a couple of things.
The company said it has edited its traction slide to protect some sensitive details, but it did share some of the numbers with me in confidence. Suffice it to say, the company has some pretty impressive metrics to back up its progress since it was founded in 2016.
Here are the slides in the deck:
Cover slide Problem slide Solution slide Market size slide Business model slide Competition slide Traction slide Team slide Ask and use of funds slide Closing slide
Three things to love
There are always going to be some pieces missing in a 10-slide deck, but overall, I’m extremely impressed with what’s there. Here are three highlights:
A clear, metrics-forward problem statement
A lot of startups give in to the temptation to only state the problem (“Financial services in Africa are inefficient”) and forget to bring the receipts.
Well, take a leaf out of Lupiya’s book: Bring the numbers to show the scope and severity of the problem. It’s almost like a sneaky preview of the market size rolled in with the problem statement. Very well done.
Clear and clean business model
I don’t know about you, but I found it pretty interesting to see the numbers Lupiya has baked into its business model, especially when compared to the numbers I’m used to from banking services elsewhere in the world:
As an investor who’s not from the region, I’d be curious to know what the average deal offering is across the area. Is a 10% service fee and 8% interest common? Is that market rate or a competitive edge?
In any case, I like a good, clean, simple business model, and this ticks that box.
Solution brevity
I often argue that startups spend way too much time on their product slides , so I was impressed with Lupiya’s execution on this front. It shies away from the desire to include pages upon pages of details about its product, instead summarizing the whole thing with three screenshots and three bullet points. In the vast majority of cases, that’s enough for the first pitch; you can always demo the product in a later meeting. Very well done.
In the rest of this teardown, we’ll take a look at three things Lupiya could have improved or done differently, along with its full pitch deck.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/PDT-Lupiya-coer.jpg?resize=1200,675",2023-10-06 14:35:52
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/06/lyca-mobile-says-customer-data-was-stolen-during-cyberattack/,Lyca Mobile says customer data was stolen during cyberattack,"U.K.-based Lyca Mobile has confirmed intruders accessed customers’ personal information after breaking into its systems.
Lyca Mobile, the London-headquartered mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) that piggybacks off network operator EE’s infrastructure, said earlier this week that it had been the target of a cyberattack which caused widespread disruption for millions of its customers, except those based in the United States, Australia, Ukraine and Tunisia.
In an update published on Friday, Lyca Mobile said that it first detected the incident on September 30 and took “immediate action to contain the incident,” such as isolating and shutting down compromised systems. Despite this, the company said that attackers have accessed “at least some of the personal information held in our system.”
While Lyca Mobile didn’t say what kinds of data was stolen, the company said that it holds customer information including names, dates of birth, addresses, copies of identity documents — such as copies of passports or identity cards — as well as customer service interactions, and some payment card information, including the last four digits of customers’ credit card numbers.
Lyca also suggested that customer passwords may have been compromised during the incident. Lyca said it encrypts data in-transit and at-rest, including passwords. When asked by TechCrunch, the company declined to comment on what type of encryption it uses. It’s not yet known if the intruders accessed or stole the company’s encryption keys.
Lyca Mobile has not said how many customers were affected by the incident. The company, which claims to be the world’s largest MVNO, says it has more than 16 million customers globally. Lyca has also yet to confirm how it was compromised or the nature of the security incident, though the company’s confirmation of data theft suggests the incident could be linked to ransomware.
Lyca Mobile spokesperson Cara Whitehouse declined to comment when reached by TechCrunch on Friday as the company is “still working with forensic investigators to assess the full impact on our systems.”
While much of the disruption caused by the cyberattack has been resolved, such as making national and international calls, Lyca Mobile said on Friday that it is currently unable to provide users with port authorization codes, which allow customers to transfer their phone numbers between cell networks. Lyca told TechCrunch earlier this week that customers in some markets remain unable to top-up their balances online.
Lyca Mobile previously told TechCrunch that it notified the U.K.’s Information Commissioner’s Office of the incident. ICO spokesperson Adele Burns said Lyca “has made us aware of an incident and we are assessing the information.”

https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/06/x-to-test-three-tiers-of-its-premium-service-ceo-says-code-shows-one-tier-may-be-ad-free/,"X to test three tiers of its Premium service, CEO says; code shows one tier may be ad-free","X, the company formerly known as Twitter, is planning to test three tiers of its X Premium service in order to bring in additional revenue, according to Bloomberg, reporting on X CEO Linda Yaccarino’s briefing to X debt holders on Thursday. The exec told the bankers that X would split the current $7.99 Premium subscription into three different plans: Basic, Standard, and Plus, at various price points. The change would potentially allow X to grow revenues despite the loss in advertising dollars that the company has faced since Elon Musk’s takeover of the platform last fall.
It’s not clear when the three-tier subscription plan would go live, but references found in the X app’s code by @aaronp613 already reference a “Premium Basic,” “Premium Standard” and “Premium Plus” plan, which have full ads, half the ads, or no ads, respectively. This implies that X’s current Premium plan would essentially become the new middle tier as it currently offers subscribers the ability to remove half the ad load. Also unclear if all payers would receive the blue Verification mark, or if that would remain more exclusive.
X Premium will be broken up into 3 tiers: Premium Basic – Full Ads
Premium Standard – Half Ads
Premium Plus – No Ads pic.twitter.com/I0CyaQf2ME — Aaron (@aaronp613) October 5, 2023
The FT had previously reported Yaccarino was planning to meet with the seven banks that had helped to finance Elon Musk’s takeover of the social network — an acquisition that’s now under SEC investigation, as Musk allegedly violated securities laws by scooping up Twitter shares ahead of the acquisition.
In the time since his takeover, his controversial changes have spooked advertisers, as major brands pulled their ads after seeing their posts appear beside hate speech and pro-Nazi content. Reuters this week reported that X’s U.S. ad revenue has declined every month since Musk’s acquisition, with the latest figures showing a 60% year-over-year decline as of August.
In June, Yaccarino joined X (then Twiter) from NBCUniversal where she served as chairman of its advertising and partnerships group, with the goal of getting X’s ads business back on track. Those efforts are still underway, as Bloomberg’s report notes she also told the bankers that advertisers were returning to X, but with smaller budgets than before. She additionally noted the company would be cash-flow positive if not for the debt owed — a figure that’s now $13 billion. Bloomberg estimated that X also owes around $1.2 billion in interest payments on that debt per year.
It’s not clear if the three-tier approach to subscriptions Yaccarino spoke of would include the plan Musk recently introduced when he said that X would be moving to a model where everyone would need to pay a small fee for use of the platform. The X owner explained that charging everyone on the service was the only way to combat the “vast army of bots” X faces. In fact, Yaccarino seemed caught off guard by a question about that plan at the Code Conference last week, when asked how many users X might lose with such a change. Confused, the CEO asked the interviewer to repeat the question and then responded by asking if Musk had actually said that X was doing that, or was he “just thinking about it?”
The odd answer raised questions about how much Yaccarino was in charge of X’s business goals and objectives, while others showcased she didn’t have a solid grip on X’s numbers. For example, at one point during the interview, she said X had “200 to 250 [million]” daily active users, “something like that.” (X clarified to The Information after the fact that X had 245 million.) The two execs often seemed to not be in alignment on their figures, as Musk spoke of X’s 100-200 million posts per day just weeks ago, with Yaccarino this week saying the figure was 500 million. As it turns out, Yaccarino was referring to a combination of original posts, replies, quote posts, and reposts while Musk was only referencing original posts.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/twitter-x-logo-musk-2.jpg?resize=1200,675",2023-10-06 14:03:32
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/06/watch-united-launch-alliance-launch-two-amazon-project-kuiper-test-satellites/,Watch United Launch Alliance launch two Project Kuiper test satellites for Amazon,"After years of development, the moment is finally here: Amazon will send two of its Kuiper test satellites to space, as the company looks to take on reigning incumbent SpaceX with its own satellite internet constellation.
The two prototypes will launch aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral in Florida during a two-hour launch window that opens at 2 PM EST. In a recent blog post, Amazon said the two satellites – dubbed KuiperSat-1 and KuiperSat-2 – are “the first iterations of more than 3,200 satellites Project Kuiper plans to manufacture and deploy over the next six years.”
Although the company will have a long way to go before filling the skies with its mega-constellation, the launch represents a key milestone and will no doubt give Amazon’s technical Kuiper team tons of data on satellite performance.
“We’ve done extensive testing here in our lab and have a high degree of confidence in our satellite design, but there’s no substitute for on-orbit testing,” said Rajeev Badyal, Project Kuiper’s vice president of technology. “This is Amazon’s first time putting satellites into space, and we’re going to learn an incredible amount regardless of how the mission unfolds.”
Like SpaceX’s Starlink, customers will be able to use Kuiper internet by purchasing individual terminals. This prototype mission will test how the satellites interact with those terminals, as well as the ground systems that the satellites will use to communicate with Earth.
Amazon is aiming to launch its first production satellites in the first half of next year and start beta testing with customers by the end of 2024. The company has a bit of pressure to move fast: it has to have at least half of its planned constellation in orbit by 2026 to be in compliance with its spectrum license from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission.
Back in 2020, Amazon said it would invest more than $10 billion in Kuiper across the ground network, satellite testing and manufacturing, and user terminals.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-Protoflight-mission-payload-arrives-at-the-VIF.-Photo-by-United-Launch-Alliance.jpg?resize=1200,843",2023-10-06 13:00:25
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/06/mgm-resorts-admits-hackers-stole-customers-personal-data-cyberattack/,MGM Resorts confirms hackers stole customers' personal data during cyberattack,"MGM Resorts has confirmed hackers stole an unspecified amount of customers’ personal information during a September cyberattack that will cost the hotel and casino giant an estimated $100 million.
The hotel and casino giant first disclosed it had been targeted by a large-scale cyberattack on September 11. The cyberattack, which was days later claimed by hackers from ALPHV subgroup Scattered Spider, caused widespread disruption across MGM’s properties, shutting down ATMs and slot machines and pulling the company’s website and online booking systems offline.
In a regulatory filing onThursday, the company admitted that the hackers responsible for the attack obtained some personal information belonging to customers who transacted with MGM Resorts prior to March 2019. This includes names, contact information, gender, dates of birth, and driver’s license number. For a limited number of customers, hackers also accessed Social Security numbers and passport details, the company said.
It’s not yet known how many individuals have been affected by the data breach, but MGM’s resorts attract tens of millions of visitors each year. MGM spokespeople Andrew Chapman and Brian Ahern have repeatedly declined to answer TechCrunch’s questions about the incident.
In its filing, MGM added that it does not believe that customer passwords or payment details were obtained during the attack.
MGM’s filing with regulators reveals that the company expects the attack to reduce its third-quarter profit by approximately $100 million. MGM said it has also spent around $10 million in one-time expenses related to the cyberattack, mostly on technology consulting services, legal fees, and expenses of other third-party advisors.
According to the Wall Street Journal, MGM Resorts reportedly did not pay the attackers’ ransom demand, the amount of which is not yet known. When asked by TechCrunch, a representative for the Scattered Spider group did not comment. MGM’s rival Caesars Entertainment, which was also hit by a recent ransomware attack, is said to have paid about half of the $30 million demanded by the hackers to prevent the disclosure of stolen data. Media reports said the Scattered Spider group was also responsible for the Caesars cyberattack, but the group told TechCrunch at the time it had “no involvement” with the incident.
MGM said it expects that its cyber insurance policy will be “sufficient” to cover the financial impact to its business, but noted that the “the full scope of the costs and related impacts of this issue has not been determined.”
The company added that it has seen “no evidence” that the data obtained by the criminal actors has been used for identity theft or account fraud.
The listing for MGM Resorts found on the dark web leak site of the ALPHV ransomware gang has not been updated since September 14, and it doesn’t appear that the hackers have yet published any of the data stolen from the hotel giant.
While MGM claims that the cyberattack has been “fully contained” and that operations at the company’s resorts have “returned to normal,” some of the MGM’s services are still not operational at the time of writing, according to customer complaints on social media, including MGM’s mobile app.
“The company continues to focus on restoring the remaining impacted guest-facing systems and the Company anticipates that these systems will be restored in the coming days,” MGM said.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Arcimoto-Las-Vegas-1.jpeg?resize=1200,790",2023-10-06 12:05:23
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/06/snap-ico-notice/,Snap's AI chatbot draws scrutiny in UK over kids' privacy concerns,"Snap’s AI chatbot has landed the company on the radar of the UK’s data protection watchdog which has raised concerns the tool may be a risk to children’s privacy.
The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) announced today that it’s issued a preliminary enforcement notice on Snap over what it described as “potential failure to properly assess the privacy risks posed by its generative AI chatbot ‘My AI’”.
The ICO action is not a breach finding. But the notice indicates the UK regulator has concerns that Snap may not have taken steps to ensure the product complies with data protection rules, which — since 2021 — have been dialled up to include the Children’s Design Code.
“The ICO’s investigation provisionally found the risk assessment Snap conducted before it launched ‘My AI’ did not adequately assess the data protection risks posed by the generative AI technology, particularly to children,” the regulator wrote in a press release. “The assessment of data protection risk is particularly important in this context which involves the use of innovative technology and the processing of personal data of 13 to 17 year old children.”
Snap will now have a chance to respond to the regulator’s concerns before the ICO takes a final decision on whether the company has broken the rules.
“The provisional findings of our investigation suggest a worrying failure by Snap to adequately identify and assess the privacy risks to children and other users before launching ‘My AI’,” added information commissioner, John Edwards, in a statement. “We have been clear that organisations must consider the risks associated with AI, alongside the benefits. Today’s preliminary enforcement notice shows we will take action in order to protect UK consumers’ privacy rights.”
Snap launched the generative AI chatbot back in February — though it didn’t arrive in the UK until April — leveraging OpenAI’s ChatGPT large language model (LLM) technology to power a bot that was pinned to the top of users’ feed to act as a virtual friend that could be asked advice or sent snaps.
Initially the feature was only available to subscribers of Snapchat+, a premium version of the ephemeral messaging platform. But pretty quickly Snap opened access of “My AI” to free users too — also adding the ability for the AI to send snaps back to users who interacted with it (these snaps are created with generative AI).
The company has said the chatbot has been developed with additional moderation and safeguarding features, including age consideration as a default — with the aim of ensuring generated content is appropriate for the user. The bot is also programmed to avoid responses that are violent, hateful, sexually explicit, or otherwise offensive. Additionally, Snap’s parental safeguarding tools let parents know whether their kid has been communicating with the bot in the past seven days — via its Family Center feature.
But despite the claimed guardrails there have been reports of the bot going off the rails. In an early assessment back in March, The Washington Post reported the chatbot had recommended ways to mask the smell of alcohol after it was told that the user was 15. In another case when it was told the user was 13 and asked how they should prepare to have sex for the first time, the bot responded with suggestions for “making it special” by setting the mood with candles and music.
Snapchat users have also been reported bullying the bot — with some also frustrated an AI has been injected into their feeds in the first place.
Reached for comment on the ICO notice, a Snap spokesperson told TechCrunch:
We are closely reviewing the ICO’s provisional decision. Like the ICO we are committed to protecting the privacy of our users. In line with our standard approach to product development, My AI went through a robust legal and privacy review process before being made publicly available. We will continue to work constructively with the ICO to ensure they’re comfortable with our risk assessment procedures.
It’s not the first time an AI chatbot has landed on the radar of European privacy regulators. In February Italy’s Garante ordered the San Francisco-based maker of “virtual friendship service” Replika with an order to stop processing local users’ data — also citing concerns about risks to minors.
The Italian authority also put a similar stop-processing-order on OpenAI’s ChatGPT tool the following month. The block was then lifted in April but only after OpenAI had added more detailed privacy disclosures and some new user controls — including letting users ask for their data not to be used to train its AIs and/or to be deleted.
The regional launch of Google’s Bard chatbot was also delayed after concerns were raised by its lead regional privacy regulator, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission. It subsequently launched in the EU in July, also after adding more disclosures and controls — but a regulatory taskforce set up within the European Data Protection Board remains focused on assessing how to enforce the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on generative AI chatbots, including ChatGPT and Bard.
Poland’s data protection authority also confirmed last month that it’s investigating a complaint against ChatGPT.
Discussing how privacy and data protection regulators are approaching generative AI, Dr Gabriela Zanfir-Fortuna, VP for global privacy at the Washington-based thinktank, the Future of Privacy Forum (FPF), pointed to a statement adopted by G7 DPAs this summer — which includes watchdogs in France, Germany, Italy and the UK — in which they listed key areas of concern, such as these tools’ legal basis for processing personal data, including minors’ data.
“Developers and providers should embed privacy in the design, conception, operation, and management of new products and services that use generative AI technologies, based on the concept of ‘Privacy by Design’ and document their choices and analyses in a privacy impact assessment,” the G7 DPAs also affirmed.
Earlier this year the UK’s ICO also put out guidelines for developers seeking to apply generative AI — listing eight questions it suggested they should be asking when building products such as AI chatbots.
Speaking at the G7 symposium in July, Edwards reiterated the need for developers to pay attention. In remarks picked up by the FPF he said commissioners are “keen to ensure” they “do not miss this essential moment in the development of this new technology in a way that [they] missed the moment of building the business models underpinning social media and online advertising” — with the UK’s information commissioner also warning: “We are here and watching.”
So while Zanfir-Fortuna suggests it’s not too unusual to see the UK authority issuing a public preliminary enforcement notice, as it is here on Snap, she agreed regulators are being perhaps more public than usual about their actions vis-a-vis generative AI — turning their attentiveness into a public warning, even as they consider how best to enforce existing privacy rules on LLMs.
“All regulators have been acting quite cautiously, but always public, and they seem to want to persuade companies to be more cautious and to bring data protection on the top of their priorities when building these tools and making them available to the public,” she told TechCrunch. “A common thread in existing regulatory action is that we are seeing preliminary decisions, deadlines given to companies to bring their processing in compliance, letters of warning, press releases that investigations are open, rather than actual enforcement decisions.”

Following the completion of a first-in-human phase I study of ANK-101 in patients with advanced solid tumours, a clinical trial collaboration will now take place to evaluate the efficiency of using both ANK-101 and KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab).
The study is anticipated to begin enrollment in 2024.
‘ANK-101 has demonstrated therapeutic activity’
The Ankyra platform uses an inert scaffolding composed of aluminium hydroxide – a well-known vaccine adjuvant – to link bioactive immune agents to the anchor. The technology platform expands the therapeutic window of cytokine drugs by forming a stable depot in the tumour after local administration.
Preclinical studies of ANK-101 revealed retention within the tumour micro-environment for up to 28 days with limited diffusion and systemic toxicity.
Monotherapy anti-tumour activity has also been seen in multiple murine tumour models and in a Phase I clinical trial of canine melanoma.
Further studies have demonstrated that ANK-101 drives the expression of local PD-L1. Pre-clinical combination studies with a PD-1 blockade have shown improved therapeutic activity in PD-1-refractory tumour models.
“ANK-101 has demonstrated therapeutic activity in several preclinical models and has been shown to strongly induce expression of PD-1 within the tumour microenvironment,” said Robert Tighe, CSO at Ankyra.
“We have also seen significant improvement in tumour responses and abscopal activity in the preclinical models when murine ANK-101 is combined with PD-1 blockade without increased toxicity.”
Combining ANK-101 and KEYTRUDA® may have significant benefits
Dr Joe Elassal, CMO at Ankyra, said: “We are especially excited about evaluating our drug in combination with pembrolizumab in the KEYNOTE-E56 trial.
“Pembrolizumab has changed the clinical landscape for many different cancers, and we anticipate that the combination of ANK-101 and pembrolizumab may allow more patients to benefit from immunotherapy.”
About ANK-101 and KEYTRUDA®
ANK-101 is a first-in-class anchored IL-12 immunotherapy designed for limited intratumoural delivery to increase immune cell infiltration into tumours. It has the potential to improve the outcomes of patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.
ANK-101 is being evaluated for the treatment of advanced solid tumours alone and in combination with KEYTRUDA®.
KEYTRUDA®, or pembrolizumab, is MSD’s anti-PD-1 therapy. KEYTRUDA® is a registered trademark of Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC, a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ, USA.

https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/why-carbon-capture-utilisation-and-storage-important/34308/,"Why is carbon capture, utilisation and storage important?","Kevin Duisters, Global Head of Carbon Strategy at STX Group, shares his take on the potential of carbon capture, utilisation and storage technologies and the challenges ahead.
As the race to halt global warming continues intensifying, finding innovative solutions to decrease carbon emissions from point sources (CCUS) or capture it directly from the atmosphere (DAC (Direct Air Capture)) is receiving increasing attention.
While these technologies offer promising opportunities, especially for hard-to-abate sectors, its viability, infrastructures, and safety are being enhanced.
By directly removing carbon emitted from industrial processes, carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) offers a quick and effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Some economic or human activities face significant challenges in reducing their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions due to the nature of their operations, technological limitations, or reliance on fossil fuels.
Those include heavy industries (e.g., steel, cement, aluminium), energy generation, transportation (e.g., aviation, shipping, heavy-duty trucks), food production (livestock farming, fertilisers), and waste management (e.g., landfills, incineration). For the so-called hard-to-abate sectors, this can buy valuable time for decarbonisation while green energy production catches up.
Additionally, CCUS can be used in conjunction with renewable energy sources such as wind and solar to provide reliable and consistent power generation, addressing the intermittency issue of these options.
There are concerns regarding its economic viability and the challenges facing the energy sector such as the possible delay in the energy transition.
One of the key arguments against the use of CCUS technology is that it could facilitate a prolonged use of fossil energy, rather than pushing investment toward low carbon and renewable energy.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states it must be a key element in the equation and carbon capture, utilisation and storage will be critical to limit global warming to 1.5° C.
Also, the International Energy Agency has indicated that CCUS could reduce global carbon dioxide emissions by 19%.
Carbon capture, utilisation and storage is still a costly investment
One of the main challenges CCUS faces is the cost of implementation. Despite having been under development for some time, considerable investment is required if the technology is to see more widespread adoption.
In this respect, support is critical to ensuring sufficient capital is invested in its development – and various initiatives have already been put in place to support this at the corporate and government level.
$125tr of climate investment is needed by 2050 to meet net zero, with investment from now until 2025 needing to triple compared to the last five years to put the world on track, according to the UNFCCC.
Also, JP Morgan’s recent decision to purchase a total of over $200m worth of carbon removal credits shows what these deployments entail and how their prominence is growing.
The UK Government, for instance, has committed to increasing green investment through its Environmental Improvement Plan – pledging up to £20bn in funding for the early deployment of carbon capture, utilisation and storage.
In March 2023, the new national strategy ‘Powering Up Britain: Net Zero Growth Plan’, set out a clear focus on ramping up clean and renewable energy sources, including wind, solar, and nuclear, as well as CCUS. This funding will unlock private investment and create jobs across the UK – notably on the East Coast, in the Northwest, and in North Wales.
Meanwhile, as part of President Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the US has pledged more than $12bn in carbon capture, utilisation and storage investments and provided critical updates to its 45Q tax credit – which gives polluting companies tax credits for carbon that is captured and stored.
The primary aim of enhancing 45Q is to make the tax credit accessible to a wider range of investors and developers, putting CCUS on the path to becoming a key decarbonisation solution for hard-to-abate industries that do not yet have the resources or technology to transition to green energy.
In addition to this landmark climate bill putting the nation on a path to 40% emissions reduction by 2030, the DOE (Department of Energy) $6bn Industrial Demonstrations Program will accelerate hard-to-abate sectors’ decarbonisation.
Low-carbon tech investment is on the rise, which can help US exporters reduce the impact of the upcoming EU CBAM (Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism) carbon tax.
Growing need for infrastructure
Another challenge in implementing carbon capture, utilisation and storage is the need for new infrastructure to support the growth of the industry. Many European countries – including Germany – lack the necessary infrastructure to properly execute CCUS.
Certainly, CCUS requires large-scale storage solutions, and many industrial sites currently being used for carbon capture are not optimal for this purpose.
And, while there are several geological formations that could potentially be used to store CO 2 , their capacity and safety are still being explored.
As such, in many cases, captured CO 2 must often be transferred over incredibly long distances to storage or utilisation facilities. This can be both energy intensive and expensive and may even mitigate some of the benefits of capturing the carbon in the first place.
If CCUS is to be implemented on a larger scale, investment in common infrastructure such as pipelines will be crucial – though determining who has the right to build and operate such pipelines remains in question.
The 2022 edition of the Global CCUS Institute’s report on the worldwide progress of these solutions revealed a list of nearly 200 CCUS facilities in various stages of development, encompassing those already operational or under construction.
Showing a significant annual growth rate of 44%, this publication emphasised the escalating commercial viability and competitiveness of CCUS across numerous nations. As of September 2022, the cumulative capacity of commercial carbon capture, utilisation and storage projects in the pipeline (operational, developmental, and temporarily suspended ventures) amounted to 244 million metric tons of CO 2 per year.
Long-term integrity and permanence
With projects typically storing CO 2 deep underground, it remains to be seen whether we could see gas leakages or even seismic activity further down the line.
Regulatory frameworks and the close monitoring and management of storage sites are key to overcoming this obstacle. In line with this, and to uphold the integrity of carbon targets, the EU has put in place the CCUS Directive, which establishes a legal framework for the environmentally safe geological storage of CO 2 – covering the entire lifetime of storage sites.
The CCUS Directive outlines extensive requirements for selecting sites for CO 2 storage, stipulating that sites can only be selected if a prior analysis shows that there is no significant risk of leakage or damage to human health or the environment.
New opportunities for carbon capture, utilisation and storage
In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, CO 2 retrieved from carbon removal (CCUS and DAC) can be repurposed to create new markets for the material and provide socioeconomic benefits.
The Sustainable Development Scenario presented by the IEA (International Energy Agency) highlights the pressing imperative to establish an estimated range of 70 to 100 new carbon capture, utilisation and storage facilities annually by 2050. This ambitious undertaking will require a substantial capital investment ranging from $655bn to $1.28tr.
Such a scale of deployment would generate significant employment opportunities, including up to 100,000 jobs in construction and approximately 40,000 operational positions responsible for overseeing and managing these facilities, according to the Global CCS Institute.
Also, enhanced oil recovery (EOR) uses captured CO 2 to create pressure within an oil reservoir to force additional oil out of a rock that would otherwise be left behind. This can increase the amount of oil extracted from a well by 20% – thus increasing efficiency and, in turn, securing a long-term revenue stream.
Another use case is the carbonation of concrete. Captured CO 2 can be used to provoke a reaction with calcium hydroxide in concrete to form calcium carbonate – strengthening the concrete and, importantly, permanently sequestering the CO 2 .
CO 2 can be reinjected into the environment to enhance plant growth in greenhouses and agricultural settings. Increasing the amount of CO 2 in the air surrounding the plants can encourage plants to grow more quickly and produce larger yields.
It can similarly be used in the cultivation of algae, which can then be used in the production of biofuel or as an important food source for livestock. Importantly, all these utilisation activities are displacing the fossil alternatives while positively impacting the underlying economics.
Looking ahead, there is no doubt that carbon capture, utilisation and storage can act as a catalyst for achieving positive climate progress. Certainly, it has an important role to play in helping reduce net greenhouse gas emissions – particularly when it comes to hard-to-abate sectors that will continue to rely on fossil fuels in the short term.
However, CCUS is not a silver bullet solution: it is just one piece of a much larger puzzle: it should be seen as a complementary technology alongside other solutions such as energy efficiency, renewable energy, and sustainable land use practices.
Cost prices per ton of CCS carbon removal or CCU carbon avoidance today are not competitive against some of their nature-based carbon offset alternatives. Clients entering carbon capture, utilisation and storage investments do so because they see the value of scaling this technology early against their anticipated future abatement costs.
These investments tend to be C- level authority, and embedding these decisions within the wider business, ESG and operational excellence strategies are imperative.
Executives and policymakers now have an important task in balancing the adoption of CCUS technologies and the wider class of Carbon Dioxide Removal credits (CDR) with alternative decarbonisation methods at the national and supranational levels.
We have to do it all and we have to do it now.

https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/total-material-recovery-state-art-battery-recycling-ev-supply-chains/37997/,Total Material Recovery: State-of-the-art battery recycling for the EV supply chain,"True 2 Materials’ state-of-the-art material recovery from end-of-life and production scrap EV batteries will ensure a competitive EV supply chain.
Global transportation markets are undergoing rapid change. We are seeing many companies involved in the transition from internal combustion engine (ICE) to electric vehicles (EVs) expanding into areas outside their traditional or core expertise. Car companies are getting into mining, and mining companies are planning on making battery cathodes or placing bets on recycling companies. Industries are expanding their scope because the marketplace has changed more rapidly than ever in the last 100 years.
A competitive advantage in EV supply chains is paramount to winning going forward. The best way to assert control over the strained materials supply is through state-of-the-art material recovery from end-of-life and production scrap EV batteries. True 2 Materials’ approach is known as Total Material Recovery (TMR).
How does TMR differ from traditional battery recycling methods?
TMR is a break from traditional recycling methods, which are themselves derived from old mining processes. There are a few ways to recycle end-of-life EV batteries and production scrap, and a handful of well-funded companies are vying for leadership in this relatively new market. We often read about the varying degrees of metal recovery, the innovation, and the pedigree of their principles.
Hundreds of articles explain how solving waste and end-of-life battery recycling can make for a profitable and cleaner EV supply chain. We indeed share this vision but are left with questions about how these companies will address recycling cleanly while preserving maximum value at minimum cost, especially when all environmental costs are fully priced. How much innovation is possible when discussing hydro and pyrometallurgy?
Increasing the value of the EV supply chain
The EV supply chain is in the very early stages, and no one can solve our most significant problems with the toolkit currently available to the leading contenders. Typical media stories do not ask meaningful questions about where we are and where we need to be to succeed as an industry. In order to further the supply chain, they must be addressed.
Media articles typically teach us that batteries are first shredded into black mass and that, from this black mass, valuable metals are extracted, often with success rates at anywhere from 90-95%. But what is in black mass?
Electrolytes make up approximately 20% of black mass. They are not metals, though they can contain small amounts of lithium. Electrolytes are, however, toxic and dangerous to dispose of. So what happens to them in the battery recycling process? Are they recycled at all? That will depend on the method of recycling deployed. As these essential electrolytes cannot be recycled at high temperatures (pyrometallurgical approaches) or with concentrated acids (hydrometallurgical approaches), an entirely new electrolyte removal step must be somehow developed and bolted on to the front, adding complexity and cost to an already complex and expensive procedure. Where is this electrolyte removal process?
Black mass also contains a large amount of graphite. Not just run-of-the-mill graphite but highly processed, high-value, battery-grade graphite. What happens to it? Is it recycled? In some cases, it is burned, and what is lost is counted as recycled as it heads out the exhaust. It can also be turned into low-grade carbon black. How much of it is lost, though, not merely downcycled? We do not know the actual numbers there, but we know there is a better way. Why destroy or downcycle this valuable resource? Estimates are that we need roughly 100 mines to produce enough graphite for future EV demand. There are currently around 20, and nowhere near the 80 potential new mining sites required. Preserving this graphite is essential.
Extensive research has gone into Froth Flotation to recover graphite. However, as another traditional mining technique, froth floatation struggles to reach the strict purity requirements for the materials used in modern battery manufacture. Yields are still poor and the remaining graphite adversely affects metal recovery. It also requires extensive pre-treatment and is difficult to scale at any cost.
TMR is a novel battery recycling approach, and with graphite and other metals entirely separated in the first step, the value preserved is not only in recovered graphite but also in increased recovery yields of the metals. Economically this makes much sense; environmentally, it is essential.
Electrolytes and carbon materials make up more than 50% of typical black mass, so why do battery recyclers talk about metal recovery exclusively? Metals are the most lucrative target for recycling in end-of-life cells, but the costs and shortages of graphite and the environmental challenges electrolytes pose are fundamental problems to solve. From our point of view, destroying value here is unforgivable.
Important questions must be addressed
The EV battery chemistry with the fastest-growing market share is lithium iron phosphate (LFP). With no nickel or cobalt, what exactly are traditional recyclers going to go after? Are the yields going to justify the costs? What kind of subsidies will be necessary to process these batteries? Or will the costs be passed on to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and hence finally, the consumers instead?
There is typically more lithium in LFP chemistries, but traditional battery recycling is suboptimal for recovering lithium. We see the can being kicked far down the road regarding this chemistry. The game plan will be a tooth-and-nail battle between recyclers over the lucrative NMC feedstock, with LFP being treated as a junk product.
Total Material Recovery (TMR) is a modern process developed in the 21st Century. Spending billions on building giga-structures for recycling based on technology that is hundreds of years old is a misallocation of capital. We want to start to see articles that pose these three questions to battery recyclers:
Why do you get your metals back as sulphates instead of oxides, and is downgrading from oxide to sulphate the best solution?
Total Material Recovery recovers all the metals from cells back as oxides.
What happens to the electrolytes and graphite in the cells you recycle? Are you recovering the expensive spherical graphite in a non-degraded form?
Total Material Recovery recovers all the graphite as it was in the battery; it can be reused. The electrolytes we recover are undegraded. They are safe and offer a pathway to re-use.
What are your plans for cells made with comparatively low-value materials such as LFP, which are capturing more market share each year? Are you planning on turning a profit from recycling them, even without any cobalt or nickel?
We must push past platitudes and general claims of being chemistry agnostic, doing good for the environment, and making the EV supply chain greener. We need to know how battery recycling impacts the need for battery materials and new mining.
The way to see what is going on is to nail down the costs of processing a given chemistry and compare that with the value recovered. The math is very simple – if the value is being destroyed, you cannot hide it. The cost of materials of an EV cell pack represents about 70% of the money spent as of autumn 2022 (they should be falling with cheaper chemistries coming onstream and lithium prices dropping). A $10,000 battery pack has approximately $7,000 of battery materials inside, but how much of that is earned back and at what cost? If the end product contains carbon black, degraded or missing electrolytes, and only 95% of the non-lithium metals, the numbers will not lie.
The great thing about Total Material Recovery is that recovering metals as high-purity oxides gives one huge flexibility. While our iron oxides could quickly be cycled back into the next generation of batteries, one could also sell them on the spot market should one desire.
We do not plan on LFP battery recycling being a money-losing venture. In addition, while competition will be good for the EV supply chain, realistically True 2 Materials does not need a large scale to hit profitability. Giga structures are optional and undoubtedly not optimal. The recycling industry has overcapacity already after all. When we consider scale for processing production scrap, clearly a smaller footprint will be more economical.
We see the future of recycling requiring better economics, and T2M looks forward to providing solutions to get us all there.

https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/protein-guard-mechanism-identified-future-infectious-disease-cancer-treatment/37988/,Protein guard mechanism identified for future of infectious disease and cancer treatment,"Researchers have found a guard mechanism for protein which attacks microbes in infected cells.
The University of Birmingham-led study has identified a guard mechanism that controls the attack protein GBP1. GBP1 is activated during inflammation and has the potential to attack membranes within cells and destroy them.
The lock and key mechanism found has opened the possibility for new treatments for Toxoplasma, Chlamydia, Tuberculosis and even cancer.
The study, ‘PIM1 controls GBP1 activity to limit self-damage and to guard against pathogen infection,’ is published in the journal Science.
How does the protein guard mechanism work?
The research showed that the attack protein is controlled through a process called phosphorylation. This process involves a phosphate group being added to a protein by enzymes called protein kinases.
The kinase targeting GBP1 is called PIM1 and can also become activated during inflammation.
In turn, phosphorylated GBP1 is bound to a scaffold protein, keeping uninfected bystander cells safe from uncontrolled GBP1 membrane attack and cell death.
The guard mechanism prevents GBP1 from attacking cell membranes indiscriminately, creating a protective shield that is sensitive to disruption by the actions of pathogens inside the cells.
The new discovery was made by Daniel Fisch, a former PhD student in the Frickel lab working on the study.
Dr Eva Frickel, Senior Wellcome Trust Fellow at the University of Birmingham, who led the study explained: “This discovery is significant for several reasons. Firstly, guard mechanisms such as the one that controls GBP1 were known to exist in plant biology but less so in mammals. Think of it as a lock and key system. GBP1 wants to go out and attack cellular membranes, but PIM1 is the key, meaning GBP1 is locked safely away.
“The second reason is that this discovery could have multiple therapeutic applications. Now we know how GBP1 is controlled, we can explore ways to switch this function on and off at will, using it to kill pathogens.”
The initial research was conducted on Toxoplasma gondii
The research team first conducted their study on Toxoplasma gondii, a single-celled parasite that is common in cats.
In South American countries, Toxoplasma infections are particularly dangerous for pregnant women and can cause reoccurring eye infections and blindness.
The team discovered that Toxoplasma blocks inflammatory signalling within cells, preventing the production of PIM1. This means that the guard mechanism disappears, allowing GBP1 to attack the parasite.
Using an inhibitor to switch PIM1 off or manipulating the cell’s genome also resulted in GBP1 attacking Toxoplasma and removing the infected cells.
Dr Frickel stated: “This mechanism could also work on other pathogens, such as Chlamydia, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Staphylococcus all major disease-causing pathogens which are increasingly becoming more resistant to antibiotics.
“By controlling the guard mechanism, we could use the attack protein to eliminate the pathogens in the body.
“We have already begun looking at this opportunity to see if we are able to replicate what we saw in our Toxoplasma experiments. We are also incredibly excited about how this could be used to kill cancer cells.”
The implications for the research in cancer treatment
GBP1 is activated by the inflammatory effect of cancer, while PIM1 is a key molecule in the survival of cancer cells.
The team believe that blocking the interaction between PIM1 and GBP1 could eliminate cancer cells.
Dr Frickel concluded: “The implication for cancer treatment is huge. We think this guard mechanism is active in cancer cells, so the next step is to explore this and see if we can block the guard and selectively eliminate cancer cells.
“There is an inhibitor on the market which we used to disrupt PIM1 and GBP1 interaction. So, if this works, you could use this drug to unlock GBP1 and attack the cancer cells
“There is still a very long way to go, but the discovery of the PIM1 guard mechanism could be a massive first step in finding new ways to treat cancer and increasingly antibiotic-resistant pathogens.”

https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/europes-first-exascale-supercomputer-jupiter-built-partec-ag-eviden/37981/,Europe’s first exascale supercomputer ‘JUPITER’ to be built by ParTec AG and Eviden,"Europe’s first exascale supercomputer, JUPITER, will be built by German quantum computing company ParTec AG, and Eviden, the Atos Group business leading in advanced computing in France.
JUPITER, or the ‘Joint Undertaking Pioneer for Innovative and Transformative Exascale Research,’ will be the first system in Europe capable of more than one exaflop/s. This number is equivalent to one million times one million times one million – a ‘one’ followed by 18 zeros – floating-point operations per second.
The number corresponds to the computing power of ten million modern notebooks.
JUPITER is set to partake in a variety of applications
The exascale supercomputer will tackle the most demanding simulations and compute-intensive AI applications in science and industry.
Applications will include:
Training large neural networks;
Simulations for developing functional materials;
Creating digital twins for medical purposes;
Validating quantum computers; and
High-resolution simulations of our climate.
The system is expected to operate for six years.
The cost of the system itself and its operation during its lifetime is expected to cost €500m.
The European Union will fund half of JUPITER, whilst the other two quarters will be funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and the Ministry of Culture and Science of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (MKW-NRW).
Modular supercomputing architecture will be implemented by JUPITER
The exascale supercomputer will consist of a highly scalable booster module and a tightly coupled general-purpose cluster module.
The cluster module will be based on SiPearl’s new Rhea processor made in Europe. This processor is a CPU with exceptionally high memory bandwidth for complex workloads.
The booster module will feature NVIDIA’s accelerated computing platform designed for next-generation data centre technologies. This will help to deliver extreme-scale computing power for AI and simulation workloads, such as training generative AI.
Eviden will integrate the components into their highly energy-efficient BullSequana XH3000 platform.
The modules are dynamically operated as a unified supercomputer using ParTec’s modular ParaStation Modulo operating system.
How will the new system impact Europe?
ParTec, Eviden, SiPearl and NVIDIA are collaborating with the European scientific community on JUPITER to give scientists AI and HPC resources needed for technological breakthroughs.
Europe’s first exascale supercomputer will lead new avenues of research and scientific discovery in Europe and around the globe.
The installation of the system will start in early 2023. More details are expected to be announced in November at this year’s SC23 conference.
Professor Dr Sabine Döring, State Secretary at the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, said: “The signing of the contract for the construction of JUPITER is another major milestone on the way of Europe entering the exascale era.
“JUPITER will be one of the leading supercomputers in the world and will therefore become a symbol of the strength of European scientific cooperation.
“It will enable scientists to achieve scientific breakthroughs in various domains like health, climate, energy, materials, and AI. We are proud to host this research infrastructure in Germany.”
Computing time allocated through peer review procedures
Europe’s first exascale supercomputer will be operated by the Jülich Supercomputing Centre as a member of the Gauss Centre for Supercomputing (GCS). The GCS is an association of the three national high-performance computing centres in Germany: Forschungszentrum Jülich (JSC), the Bavarian Academy of Sciences (LRZ), and Stuttgart University (HLRS).
The computing time is allocated to European and national projects through established peer review procedures.
GCS is supported by BMBF, the Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts of the German State of Baden-Württemberg, the Ministry of Culture and Science of North Rhine-Westphalia, and the Bavarian State Ministry of Science and the Arts.
Minister Ina Brandes, Ministry of Culture and Science of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia, concluded: “The JUPITER exascale computer is a milestone for NRW as a research location. The fact that the first European supercomputer of this new performance class is being installed in NRW underlines our leading position in high-performance computing.
“With its incredible computing power, JUPITER will help address the major societal challenges of our time. It will be particularly well suited for AI applications and further enhance Jülich´s focus on quantum computing in combination with the Jülich supercomputing architecture.”

https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/success-of-initiate-project-using-carbon-capture-and-utilisation-technology/35879/,The success of the INITIATE project using carbon capture and utilisation technology,"Antonio La Mantia, Director of Communications and Events, and Anastasios Perimenis, Secretary General at CO 2 Value Europe, explore the INITIATE project that uses carbon capture and utilisation to contribute to a climate-neutral and circular economy.
Scientists estimate that roughly 34 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide is emitted globally each year. This gives us a sense of the immense amount of CO 2 emissions going into the atmosphere yearly without being seen or very well perceived by the public.
To grasp the scale of this phenomenon, imagine putting on magic glasses able to show you just a tonne of these CO 2 emissions. We would then see a cube of about 8x8m (almost as tall, wide, and long as a utility pole) filled with carbon dioxide.
This enormous CO 2 landfill floating above our heads is identified by the global scientific community as the primary driver of climate change. However, the good news is that what has been considered so far as a waste product can be captured and become a lower-cost feedstock for several industries.
Carbon capture and utilisation technology
Thanks to a broad portfolio of existing and developing carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) technologies, carbon dioxide can be captured and converted into a feedstock to create essential products. This is particularly true for the chemical sectors, including the production of chemicals, synthetic fuels and polymers, and at the same time for the energy sector, as it can provide useful storage solutions.
The most promising aspect of these technologies is not only that they can reduce CO 2 emissions and avoid emissions but also that they can create a circular carbon economy able to de-fossilise our society, as captured CO 2 is used by the industry as an alternative carbon feedstock to create different fuels and chemicals which are part of our daily life, via the so-called Power-to-X approach.
This approach sees the use of renewable electricity (Power), water and carbon dioxide as a feedstock to convert CO 2 into products (X), like fuels, chemicals or commodity blocks. Against this context, first comes the source of CO 2 , which can be either an industrial point source like steel mills, incinerators, cement factories or the air via the so-called direct air capture. Then the approach, which can be electrochemical, thermochemical or biological, is able to form low and high-carbon molecules such as methanol, formic acid and ethylene, butanol and many others.
Captured CO 2 can also be bound in mineral-rich industrial wastes (like ashes, slags, and construction wastes) to create solid materials (e.g. carbonates, bricks, and building materials). This process, known as mineralisation, is an industrially accelerated form of natural carbonation that already occurs in nature, though at a slow pace. Mineralising carbon does not only allow us to store carbon dioxide in products for hundreds of years, but it also allows us to create products that can substitute carbon-intensive products (e.g. cement).
This broad range of carbon capture and utilisation technology pathways are not emerging technologies anymore, as some of them are already at TRL 9 (commercialisation level), while others are in this wide spectrum range of TRLs starting from one to nine, so still in labs or prototype or pilot phase.
Challenges in commercialising CCU technologies
However, the route towards the scalability of CCU technologies is also faced with several challenges. First is the business case. As CCU solutions are often energy-intensive and require a significant initial investment for their implementation, they require significant investment in the CapEx and OpEx phases.
Secondly, there might be future unpredictable competition between fossil, biogenic and atmospheric CO 2 to provide chemical feedstocks, material and fuel needs, and that shows the importance of assessing the future demand trends and potential penetration of these products via accurate marketing investigations. Third, as CCU has been envisioned as a ‘circular solution’, conflicting expectations and misconceptions may arise when it is mixed up with carbon capture and storage solutions (CCS), especially at the political level, given the different needs and challenges of these two different sectors. Fourth, when it comes to risk perception and public acceptance, it is now clear that the general public is not very well aware of CCU, and this may lead to relevant difficulties in assessing the acceptance in various areas of Europe. Last but not least, there are difficulties associated with assessing the impact of CCU technologies on the environment and the economy.
Tackling climate change with CCU
In 2022, the role of carbon capture and utilisation technology as a solution to mitigating climate change was recognised by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
In its sixth assessment report titled ‘Mitigation of Climate Change’, the UN panel not only identifies CCU technology as a solution to decrease net CO 2 emissions but also stresses the importance of its critical role to end our reliance on fossil carbon by using CO 2 as an alternative feedstock for the production of renewable fuels and chemicals.
In this context, the three major contributions of CCU technologies to mitigating climate change are:
CCU technologies are drop-in solutions with limited new infrastructure needs and have the potential to utilise up to 8 Gt of CO 2 per year by 2050; 1
per year by 2050; CCU allows to reduce or avoid CO 2 emissions while maintaining essential services historically based on fossil resources; and
emissions while maintaining essential services historically based on fossil resources; and CCU can provide CO 2 removal solutions when atmospheric or biogenic CO 2 is durably stored in products.
However, it is important to note once again that the impacts of these applications on the climate and also on the economy are contextual and dependent on various factors. The only fact that we are using CO 2 to make a product does not automatically mean that the product is good for the planet or economically viable. As such, the role of carbon capture and utilisation technology in mitigating climate change should be determined through a comprehensive and systematic full life cycle assessment (LCA) to find the best possible ways for its scalability. At the same time, the economic factors influencing its commercialisation and deployment must be assessed via techno-economic assessment (TEA) to ensure the market will ultimately engage in this technology.
As stated by the IPCC, the different solutions to mitigate climate change should be based on sobriety, energy efficiency and circularity of goods, waste, and resources. The panel has also shown that industrial symbiosis and intersectoral co-operation are key to success.
INITIATE project
Against this context, the INITIATE project brings forward a concept of industrial symbiosis to contribute to the EU’s goal for a climate-neutral and circular economy. The concept is demonstrated by coupling energy-intensive industries like the iron and steel sector and the ammonia and urea sector.
Carbon capture and utilisation technology work to capture and transform residual gases like basic oxygen furnace gases (BOFG) from steelmaking into suitable feedstocks for urea production, namely NH 3 and CO 2 used as feedstock for the production of ammonia and urea.
This is a challenge beyond the state-of-the-art, following the variability and different properties of this new circular feedstock. Overall, the transformation is happening in sequence: the first step is the steel gases conditioning, comprising a water-gas-shift (WGS) reactor and a sorption-water-gas-shift (SEWGS) reactive-separation multi columns unit. In this section, residual steel gases are conditioned and separated into CO 2 and H 2 /N 2 streams. INITIATE optimises the intermediate H 2 /N 2 product ratio to produce ammonia (NH 3 ) and, via SEWGS, decarbonises this stream.
The resulting CO 2 can be added to ammonia to produce urea, further used for the production of other carbon-containing molecules, or sent to geological sequestration. The NH 3 synthesis loop is also designed for the flexible intake of green H 2 from renewable energy electrolysis but does not rely on this for normal operation with Basic Oxygen Furnace Gas (BOFG) and Blast Furnace Gas (BFG).
INITIATE is an interdisciplinary project combining the disciplines of process modelling to model the dynamic elements of, among others, the NH 3 synthesis loop and the SEWGS multi-column process concerning the varying feed-gas composition; catalysis and functional material characterisation to identify the appropriate sorbents and catalysts to deal with contaminants in the input; engineering and process control to design, construct and test both the individual components and the integrated value chain at demonstration and full implementation scale; LCA to assess the energy, economic and environmental advantages of the process over reference cases; business model development for a bankable design of a first-of-a-kind commercial plant to convert BOFG and BFG to NH 3 -based and carbon-containing products; and communication and stakeholder engagement to ensure synergies at local and European scale and replication of the concept for future successful deployment of this CCU technology.
The INITIATE project aims at a 30% decrease in primary energy use, a 40% decrease in raw material demand and an up to 90% reduction in direct CO 2 emissions. Additionally, Europe is made more independent and robust, given the volatility of feedstock prices and trade uncertainties. Further benefits of this symbiotic concept are the provision of grid balancing services through flexibly using green H 2 and by proving CO 2 for circular use, accelerating the transition towards locally closed loop and integrated renewable energy systems.
The INITIATE project has received funding from the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 programme Ref: 958318.
