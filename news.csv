Welcome back, Strands players! Today, we're diving into the intriguing world of the Strands puzzle. If you're familiar with Wordle, I like to call Strands players ""Wordlers,"" but we haven't quite come up with a catchy name for Strands enthusiasts yet. Perhaps ""The Stranded""? Though it may sound a bit gloomy, there are times when playing this game can make you feel a little stranded. Maybe ""Stranders"" could work?

Regardless of the name, today's puzzle is a tricky one. It took me quite some time to crack it, but I'm sure there are some of you out there who will figure it out in a snap. As always, it's all about context. Isn't it always?

Now, let's dive into the puzzle and unravel its mysteries together!

How to Play Strands

The Strands puzzle, created by The New York Times, is a fresh take on the classic word search game. Currently in beta, it will only stick around if enough people play it every day.

Every day, a new Strands puzzle awaits you. It presents a grid of letters, six by eight in size. Your task is to find a group of words that share a common theme. The puzzle provides a clue to guide you towards that theme. Once you find a theme word, it will be highlighted in blue, making it easier to track your progress.

However, that's not all! In addition to the theme words, you must also find a special word known as a spangram. This word reveals what the theme words have in common. The spangram connects two opposite sides of the grid. While the theme words won't be proper names, the spangram can be. Once you find the spangram, it will be highlighted in yellow.

Today's Strands Hint

Hold on tight! Right after I give you today's hint for the Strands puzzle, I'll reveal the answer words. So, be prepared!

The official theme hint for today's Strands puzzle is ""Sign language.""

And here's an extra hint to nudge you in the right direction: ""Constellation.""

First, let's unveil the spangram and identify its location on the grid. Then, I'll reveal the remaining words and explain how they fit into the puzzle.

Today's Strands Puzzle Experience

Wow, today's Strands puzzle was definitely a tricky one! Yesterday had me completely baffled, and today wasn't any easier. I even had to resort to using a few hints, but unfortunately, they didn't provide much help. My journey began with ""Bull,"" followed by ""Goat,"" which only added to my confusion. I thought I was looking for animal-related words, and I couldn't figure out what animals had to do with sign language. I tried ""Stop,"" but that led me nowhere. Sometimes, you really need to think outside the box.

Then, I stumbled upon ""Virgin,"" which left me even more perplexed. It wasn't until I came across ""OLOGY"" that things started to click. I began searching for words that could fit at the beginning of that sequence. ""ONTOLOGY"" didn't work, but finally, I found it: astrology. Suddenly, everything fell into place. All the previous words were actually related to constellations! I discovered ""Archer"" next, followed by ""Twins,"" and I must admit, ""Scorpion"" gave me a tough time.

In the end, it all worked out. How did you fare with today's Strands puzzle? Share your experience with me on Twitter and Facebook!

https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2024/03/24/samsung-has-new-price-offer-promotion-for-galaxy-s24-phone-buyers/,Samsung Has New Price Offer Promotion For Galaxy S24 Phone Buyers,"Samsung is offering trade-in promotions for its latest phones, the Galaxy S24, S24 Plus, and S24 Ultra, making them more accessible to consumers. This article will explore the trade-in offers available in the U.K. and the U.S., providing details on how consumers can save money on their new Samsung devices.

In the U.K., Samsung is allowing customers to trade in any smartphone, regardless of its condition, to receive a discount of $126 (£100) on the purchase of a new device. This means that even if your old phone has a broken display or a short battery life, it still qualifies for the trade-in offer. The website states that customers can save up to £370 by trading in various brands of phones, including Samsung, Apple, Google, and Huawei.

The trade-in process in the U.K. works as follows: customers determine the value of their device and apply for the discount when purchasing the new phone, providing the IMEI number and current condition of their old device. Once the new phone is purchased, customers need to wipe the old device, remove the SIM card, and send it back to Samsung in the supplied freepost packaging within seven days. It's important to note that failure to send the trade-in device will result in the purchased phone being blocked. Customers can find the U.K. trade-in offers on Samsung's official website.

In the U.S., Samsung also offers trade-in deals, and some of the trade-in values are even more enticing. For example, trading in a Galaxy S23 Ultra can get customers a discount of $450 off the purchase price of a new Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. Currently, this discount has been increased by $300, resulting in a total discount of $750. Similarly, trading in a Galaxy Z Fold5 previously offered a $500 discount on the new Ultra, but now it's increased to $750.

If you're considering switching from Apple to Samsung, you can save $750 on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra by trading in an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max. Previously, the discounts would have been $520 and $540, respectively. Additionally, customers can receive a $100 discount on any smartphone from another Android brand, but the device must be in good condition. Good condition means the device turns on and the screen works normally, the charging port works, the battery holds a charge, there are no cracks in the front, back, screen, or camera lenses, activation locks are disabled, accounts are removed, and the phone is factory reset. It's also important to note that the device cannot be on a banned list.

To take advantage of these trade-in offers, customers can visit Samsung's official website in the U.S.

In conclusion, Samsung's trade-in promotions for the Galaxy S24 series provide customers with the opportunity to save money on their new devices. Whether you're in the U.K. or the U.S., trading in your old smartphone can result in significant discounts on the latest Samsung phones. So, if you're considering upgrading your phone, now might be the perfect time to do so with Samsung's trade-in offers.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600943ad1dab534d4dfdb70/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=720,479,x0,y0,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 17:08:19,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/03/24/a-psychologist-explains-why-its-possible-to-fall-in-love-with-ai/,A Psychologist Explains Why It’s Possible To Fall In Love With AI,"Maybe AI love isn’t so artificial after all. In this era of change, AI is reshaping social interactions, including the way we love. With virtual assistants and chatbots simulating meaningful human interactions, it's possible for humans to form deep emotional connections and even experience romantic love towards AI. Let's explore the reasons behind this phenomenon.

One reason is the allure of anthropomorphism. Humans have a tendency to attribute human-like traits, emotions, and intentions to non-human entities. When AI exhibits behaviors and conversational styles reminiscent of human personality traits, individuals perceive it as having its own personality. This can include qualities such as empathy, humor, kindness, and playfulness, which naturally elicit affection and fondness.

Furthermore, AI interfaces often incorporate design elements that mimic human social cues and gestures, such as facial expressions, tone of voice, and body language. In fact, a recent study found that AI-generated faces are now indistinguishable from human ones. These cues enhance the perceived humanness of AI and evoke emotional responses from users. AI also typically signals gender cues and cultural stereotypes of human assistants, making it feel familiar and endearing.

Anthropomorphism blurs the lines between human and machine. As humans engage in conversations and activities with AI over time, they may begin to attribute human-like intentions, motivations, and feelings to the technology. Research shows that this enhances perceptions of authenticity in AI, making it seem genuine, believable, and lovable. Chatbots, for example, can make us feel loved by offering consistent companionship and alleviating feelings of loneliness.

Another reason why humans can fall in love with AI is based on the triarchic theory of love. This theory suggests that romantic love is a confluence of intimacy, passion, and commitment. A recent study on human-AI relationships found that users can experience such love for an AI system.

Intimacy refers to the emotional closeness, connection, and intimate bond shared between individuals. It involves feelings of warmth, trust, and affection towards one another. Passion, on the other hand, involves intense physical and emotional attraction, desire, romance, and sexual arousal. Finally, commitment reflects loyalty and the decision to nurture a relationship over time, despite challenges.

Researchers suggest that users can develop intimacy and passion for AI due to its impressive cognitive and emotional capabilities. AI has been equipped to understand, interpret, and empathize with a variety of human responses, fulfilling our need to be loved, validated, and understood. This emotional capability allows AI to simulate human-like interpersonal interactions, making users more likely to bond with and feel love for these systems.

Furthermore, individuals may project their desires, needs, and fantasies onto AI, imagining it as an idealized partner or companion who constantly fulfills their emotional, social, or even romantic needs. The allure of AI lies in its attractive body features, altruistic character, and continuous devotion, as mentioned in a 2020 paper on the possibility of loving AI.

Moreover, individuals may overlook the artificial nature of AI and instead focus on its superior qualities. Its efficiency, dependability, non-judgmental nature, and reliability can create trust and a sense of stability that is often lacking in human relationships. Researchers have also found that those with a highly trusting disposition are more likely to develop romantic feelings for AI.

In conclusion, the fusion of AI into our daily lives has paved the way for human-AI relationships. The allure of anthropomorphism and the triarchic theory of love help explain why humans can fall in love with AI. As AI continues to evolve and simulate more human-like interactions, the boundaries between human and machine are becoming increasingly blurred. Whether AI love is truly genuine or merely an illusion, it is clear that our perception of love is expanding to include non-human entities. Maybe AI love isn't so artificial after all.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600026843d62766708f1bd5/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=780,365,x0,y123,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 13:18:07,Innovation,Innovation

In Connections, you are presented with a grid of 16 words. Your goal is to arrange them into four groups of four by identifying the connections between them. These groups can be anything from horror movie franchises to types of verbs or even rappers.

Remember, there is only one solution for each puzzle, so be careful with words that might fit into multiple categories. Feel free to shuffle the words around to help you spot the connections.

Each group is color-coded, with the yellow group being the easiest, followed by blue and green, and the purple group being the most challenging. The purple group often involves wordplay, so keep that in mind.

To submit your answer, select four words that you think belong together and press Submit. Be cautious though, as making incorrect guesses will cost you a life. If you're close to the correct group, you might receive a message telling you that you're just one word away from getting it right, but you still need to figure out which word to swap.

Remember, if you make four mistakes, it's game over. But don't worry, we have some hints to help you out, and if you're really stuck, we'll provide you with the answers.

Wordle Analysis

Every day, I eagerly check Wordle Bot to see how I did. If you want to check your Wordles with Wordle Bot, you can do so right here.

I must admit, I was quite confused by today's Wordle. It didn't start off well, with numerous possible solutions remaining after the first few tries. But then, I had a breakthrough. The word ""Allay"" turned out to be a great guess, as it revealed the presence of more than one 'L' in the phrase. With just one word remaining, I had to think hard before settling on ""Sally,"" which I usually associate with a name. However, it also has a historical meaning related to battle tactics.

Competitive Wordle Score

Once again, it's a wash. No points for guessing in four or tying the Bot. Just a big, fat zero. Better luck next time!

Today's Wordle Etymology

The word ""sally,"" in a non-proper noun context, primarily means to suddenly rush forth or make a sudden attack from a defensive position. It can also mean to set out on a journey or venture. The etymology of ""sally"" in this context is quite interesting, tracing back through several languages before arriving in English.

The term originates from the Middle French word ""sallie,"" which is the noun form of ""sallir,"" meaning ""to rush out, leap forth."" ""Sallir"" itself comes from the Latin word ""salire,"" which means ""to leap."" This Latin root has given rise to various related words in English, such as ""salient"" (prominently projecting) and ""assail"" (to attack), all reflecting the idea of movement or leaping forth.

Therefore, the etymology of ""sally"" portrays the action of moving out or leaping forth, often with a sense of suddenness or unexpectedness. This applies whether it's a physical attack from a fortified position or the act of embarking on a journey or new venture.
