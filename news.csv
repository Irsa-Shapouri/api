https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-apple-breakups-agenda-global-regulators-target-tech-2024-03-24/,"Google, Apple breakups on the agenda as global regulators target tech","Big Tech companies like Apple and Google are currently facing a major challenge as antitrust regulators in the United States and Europe are cracking down on their alleged anti-competitive practices. This crackdown could potentially lead to break-up orders for these companies, which would be unprecedented in the industry. The possibility of break-up orders has sparked concerns among other regulators around the world, leading to an increase in the number of antitrust probes being conducted in various countries.

The case against Apple and Google revolves around the accusation that these companies have created impenetrable ecosystems around their products, making it difficult for customers to switch to rival services. This has led to the term ""walled gardens"" being used to describe their practices. The US Department of Justice has warned Apple that a break-up order is not off the table as a potential remedy to restore competition. Apple has vowed to fight the lawsuit, but it is expected to take years for a decision to be reached.

In Europe, there are also mounting threats against Big Tech companies. Apple, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet are likely to be investigated for potential violations of the Digital Markets Act (DMA). These violations could result in hefty fines and even break-up orders for repeated breaches. The European Union's antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager, has already accused Google of anti-competitive practices in its adtech business and has suggested that Google may have to divest its sell-side tools to avoid conflicts of interest and promote fair competition.

While it is not guaranteed that regulators will issue break-up orders, they are considering various options and actions that could be taken against these companies. Legal experts believe that the case against Apple may be more difficult compared to previous cases, such as the one against Microsoft in 1998. Breaking up Apple's highly integrated system would be challenging, unlike Google, where a break-up order could focus on divesting acquisitions that have strengthened its services.

Instead of break-up orders, regulators may opt for other remedies, such as imposing behavioral obligations on Apple or requiring Google to open up hardware functionality. The goal is to ensure fair competition and prevent anti-competitive practices without resorting to extreme measures. Apple generates most of its revenue from selling hardware, followed by its Services business. Structural remedies that aim to promote competition and innovation in the market are being considered.

Overall, Big Tech companies are facing significant scrutiny from regulators around the world. Break-up orders remain a possibility, but it is unclear whether regulators will ultimately choose this path. The outcome of these investigations and lawsuits will have far-reaching implications for the tech industry and the future of competition in the digital market.",https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PRF3PCUPHNMIRKLHQK7EGGMCNM.jpg?auth=239a71c48c8f574b566b95165f95da7964fc982cd6d222dcfc167ab3eff09e51&width=1920&height=1005&smart=true,2024-03-24 01:04:50,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) may seem like different companies, but they share similarities in their growth trajectories. Both companies stumbled upon their core businesses by accident. AWS discovered that it could sell its internal services to others, while Nvidia realized that its gaming GPU was ideal for processing AI workloads. This led to explosive revenue growth for both companies, with Nvidia's revenue reaching $22.1 billion in Q4 2024, primarily driven by its data center business. Although AWS didn't experience the same growth spurt, it has consistently been a major revenue driver for Amazon. However, as Microsoft and Google entered the market, the cloud industry became more competitive, and it is expected that other chip makers will also gain market share in the future.

Both Nvidia and AWS were in the right place at the right time. As web apps and mobile technology emerged, the cloud became a valuable resource for enterprises, allowing them to move workloads and build applications without running their own data centers. Similarly, the rise of AI and large language models coincided with the increased use of GPUs for processing these workloads.

While AWS has become a highly successful and profitable business, its growth has started to slow down. In contrast, Nvidia's growth is accelerating. However, it remains to be seen whether Nvidia can sustain this growth and become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS. If the GPU market tightens, Nvidia has other businesses, but they are smaller and growing more slowly than the data center business.

In terms of financial outlook, Nvidia's revenue growth has been astronomical in recent quarters, and it is expected to continue. The company anticipates $24 billion worth of revenue in its current quarter, with a growth rate of around 234% compared to the year-ago period. While Nvidia's growth rate is expected to decline, it is still impressive, and analysts predict significant growth for the company in the coming years. However, there are concerns about future growth declines as competition increases.

Despite potential competition from AMD, Intel, and other chipmakers, Nvidia is expected to maintain its dominance in the market, especially at the chip level. IDC data shows Nvidia firmly in control, while AMD is gaining ground at the board level, according to Jon Peddie Research. Analysts believe that AI will continue to be a lucrative market for Nvidia in the next few years, but the company will face stiffer competition. Nevertheless, Nvidia currently holds a significant market share and can afford to cede some to competitors.

In conclusion, Nvidia and AWS have experienced remarkable growth in their respective markets. While AWS has become a highly profitable business, Nvidia's growth trajectory is even more impressive. The future holds both opportunities and challenges for both companies as they navigate an increasingly competitive landscape. However, with its strong position in the market and the continued growth of AI, Nvidia appears to be primed for long-term success.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/billkoenig/2024/03/25/uaw-chiefs-second-act-shawn-fain-stays-in-the-public-eye/,UAW Chief’s Second Act: Shawn Fain Stays In The Public Eye,"Shawn Fain, the president of the United Auto Workers (UAW) union, made headlines in 2023 when he led a strike against major automakers like General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis. The Detroit-based union achieved significant gains through these strikes, but Fain is not stopping there. He has set his sights on new goals and is determined to make a difference.

One of Fain's recent achievements is securing commitments from President Joseph Biden to support the unionization of Volkswagen AG's factory complex in Tennessee. This is a significant step forward for the UAW, as previous attempts to unionize the Tennessee VW complex were unsuccessful. Fain and the UAW are hopeful that this time around, their efforts will yield better results.

In addition to his efforts in unionizing, Fain has also been advocating for a shorter work week without any reduction in pay. In a joint opinion piece with Sen. Bernie Sanders published in The Washington Post, Fain argues that American workers are now over 400% more productive than they were in the 1940s. Despite this increase in productivity, many Americans are working longer hours for lower wages. Fain and Sanders highlight the fact that 28.5 million Americans now work over 60 hours a week, and more than half of full-time employees work more than 40 hours a week. They point out that Americans work more hours than people in most other wealthy nations, and believe that a four-day work week could help address this issue.

Fain's ambitions extend beyond traditional union talks with automakers. In the past, UAW leaders like Walter Reuther, Leonard Woodcock, and Douglas Fraser have been vocal about a wide range of social issues, including civil rights. However, in recent decades, UAW officials have been more cautious when it comes to commenting on social issues. The union has faced financial difficulties and scandals, which may have contributed to this change in approach. Fain, however, is proving to be a leader with a broader vision.

It is unclear where Fain's ambitions will lead him and the UAW. His efforts to unionize the Tennessee VW complex and advocate for a four-day work week are significant steps forward, but only time will tell how successful these endeavors will be. One thing is certain – Fain is not afraid to aim high and fight for the rights and well-being of American workers. As the president of the UAW, he is making his mark and showing that he is a force to be reckoned with in the labor movement.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600bf00c2acfb8ee845a3b1/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 07:30:00,Innovation,Innovation

The court made this decision as it awaits a police report on the potential impact the ban would have on users. The initial order was issued by Judge Santiago Pedraz, who was investigating claims by media companies that Telegram was allowing users to upload content without permission. The suspension of Telegram's services was scheduled to take effect on Monday, but Pedraz decided to halt the enforcement of the order and instead asked for a police report on Telegram's characteristics and the potential impact of a suspension on its users.

During the investigation, Pedraz requested information on the identities of users suspected of sharing protected content illegally. The court had asked the authorities in the Virgin Islands, where Telegram is registered as a business, to provide this information, but they failed to comply. The Spanish consumers' association, FACUA, expressed its satisfaction with the court's decision to reconsider the ban and hoped that the police report would lead to the revocation of the order.

According to the competition watchdog CNMC, Telegram is the fourth most popular messaging service in Spain, with nearly 19% of Spaniards surveyed using it. This temporary suspension of the ban will come as a relief to the many users of Telegram in the country.

In conclusion, the High Court in Spain has suspended its order to block Telegram's services while waiting for a police report on the potential impact of a ban. This decision comes after media companies accused Telegram of allowing users to upload content without permission.

https://venturebeat.com/ai/companies-are-about-to-waste-billions-on-ai-heres-how-not-to-become-one-of-them/,Companies are about to waste billions on AI - here's how not to become one of them,"Join Gen AI enterprise leaders in Boston on March 27 for an exclusive networking event focused on data integrity. Request an invite here.

In the world of venture capital, it's all about the money. But when it comes to new technologies like AI, caution often takes a backseat to the excitement of the hype cycle. VCs are under pressure to invest their capital and fear missing out on the next big thing. This same dynamic plays out within companies, where anything associated with AI becomes a buzzword that can secure funding.

However, this enthusiasm for AI can lead to billions of dollars being wasted over the next decade. While search, social, and mobile technologies have had a lasting impact, others like virtual reality and crypto have fallen short of expectations. The current AI frenzy may lead to a few success stories, but it's also likely to result in a lot of missed opportunities.

Despite the risks, it's important to recognize that large language models (LLMs) are truly game-changing. Just look at the rapid growth of ChatGPT and its 100 million users. Almost every enterprise company is exploring LLMs and AI, but the question is how to make smart investments and ensure a return on that investment.

To make informed decisions about AI projects, there are three key factors to consider:

1. Understand the total cost over time: Before saying yes to an AI project, evaluate the resources required to sustain it. The work of a data science team often involves significant engineering, DevOps, QA, product, and SysOps support. Projects that lack ongoing investment rarely succeed in the long run. It may be difficult to say no to an AI initiative, but it's crucial to prioritize and fully fund the projects with real potential.

Another aspect of cost is the increasing marginal cost associated with AI. Training, running, and maintaining large models can be expensive. Overusing AI without generating sufficient downstream value can erode profit margins. Additionally, retracting or limiting promised functionality can lead to customer dissatisfaction and damage a company's reputation as a leader in AI.

2. Ask why you are uniquely positioned: The tech industry can be divided into monopolies and commodities. When considering an AI initiative, ask yourself why your company is the right choice for the task. If the project is likely to commoditize over time, with scale and cost being the only sustainable advantages, it may not be a wise investment. Instead, focus on areas where you have a defensive moat, such as preferential access to data, proprietary insights, or applications with strong network effects.

3. Make strategic bets: Sometimes, the best AI projects are the ones that enhance your existing business. Rather than trying to reinvent the wheel, focus on improving what you already offer. This approach aligns with the BASF commercial slogan: ""We don't make the things you buy, we make the things you buy better."" By leveraging AI to enhance your core products or services, you can gain momentum and stay ahead of the competition.

In conclusion, the AI revolution is both exciting and risky. While large language models have the potential to transform industries, it's important to approach AI investments with a clear understanding of cost, uniqueness, and strategic alignment. By making informed decisions and avoiding the hype, companies can maximize the value of their AI investments and avoid wasting billions of dollars.",https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/An_AI_sitting_in_a_corner_curled_up_looking_sa-transformed.jpeg?w=1200&strip=all,2024-03-24 18:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.reuters.com/business/google-says-will-defend-its-dma-compliance-coming-months-2024-03-25/,Google says will defend its DMA compliance in coming months,"Google has announced that it will continue to defend its compliance with the Digital Markets Act as EU antitrust regulators launch an investigation into potential violations of EU tech rules. Oliver Bethell, Google's competition director, stated that the company has already made significant changes to its services in Europe to adhere to the regulations. Despite the investigation, Google remains committed to defending its approach in the following months.

The European Union's Digital Markets Act aims to regulate large tech companies and prevent anti-competitive practices. It focuses on enhancing competition, fostering innovation, and ensuring a level playing field for all market participants. This investigation into Google's compliance is a significant step toward enforcing these regulations. 

Google's strong stance on defending its approach is not surprising, considering the potential impact of any regulatory actions. As one of the world's largest technology companies, Google's operations and market dominance are closely scrutinized. The outcome of this investigation will have far-reaching implications not only for Google but also for the wider tech industry.

In recent years, Google has faced several antitrust investigations and legal challenges globally. The company has been accused of prioritizing its own services in search results, thereby disadvantaging competitors. The Digital Markets Act is designed to address such concerns and ensure fair competition in the digital market.

Google's competition director, Oliver Bethell, emphasized the changes that the company has already made to comply with the Digital Markets Act. These changes are aimed at ensuring transparency and fairness in Google's operations, particularly in relation to search results and advertising. By implementing these modifications, Google hopes to demonstrate its commitment to complying with the regulations and fostering a competitive market landscape.

It is worth noting that complying with these regulations is not just a legal requirement for Google; it also presents an opportunity for the company to strengthen its reputation and regain public trust. In recent years, tech giants like Google have faced criticism regarding their market dominance and alleged anti-competitive practices. By actively engaging with regulatory bodies and making necessary changes, Google can position itself as a responsible and accountable player in the digital market.

The investigation into Google's compliance with the Digital Markets Act will likely involve a thorough examination of the company's business practices, algorithms, and market behavior. EU antitrust regulators will assess whether Google's actions comply with the principles of fair competition and whether it has taken appropriate measures to address any anti-competitive behavior.

As the investigation unfolds, it will be interesting to see how Google responds to the allegations and what steps it takes to defend its approach. The outcome of this investigation will not only impact Google's operations in Europe but also set a precedent for other tech companies operating within the European Union.

In conclusion, Google's commitment to defending its compliance with the Digital Markets Act reflects the company's determination to adhere to regulatory requirements and maintain its position in the digital market. The investigation by EU antitrust regulators will shed light on Google's business practices and the extent to which it complies with the principles of fair competition. As the investigation progresses, it will be crucial for Google to demonstrate transparency, accountability, and a genuine commitment to fostering a competitive market environment.",https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BS57LGJDPNIHVFCUF6UGJKEWS4.jpg?auth=b1f2a139a946ca2fa58efa03cdca4f6a8144370f9e2a12203ecfadb750c57805&width=1920&height=1005&smart=true,2024-03-25 10:26:53,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/03/25/handling-mobile-app-project-transfers-from-previous-provider/,Handling Mobile App Project Transfers From Previous Provider,"""After us, the deluge""—this is something no product owner, CEO, or founder wants to hear when transferring a project to a new software provider. Many companies choose to outsource their software development projects, but only a small percentage of them are completely satisfied with the results. The rest either compromise on their initial vision or face the consequences of their choice of partner. However, what is even more concerning is the increasing trend of customers seeking development services for project rescue purposes. It is crucial to emphasize the importance of maintaining the project's integrity, even when considering a long-term collaboration with a new team.

During the transitional period, it is important to plan and coordinate with all project stakeholders. However, it is equally vital to understand the short-term objectives and what you hope to achieve. The success of a project handover can be measured by four main criteria: quick knowledge exchange between teams, efficient onboarding for the new vendor, fast project launch and development by the new team, and the possibility of continuous project work. All actions taken during the transition should align with these objectives to ensure a smooth handover.

There are some challenges and risks that should be anticipated when switching suppliers. One common risk is the poor quality of service after terminating the contract. In some cases, the vendor may lose motivation to deliver the same level of quality once they know they are being replaced. To minimize this risk, it is important to clarify expectations and set clear timelines on paper. Additionally, thorough testing of the app should be conducted to ensure its quality.

Another challenge is being caught between two fires. It is common for projects to transition from the previous vendor to the client and then to a new team, rather than a direct collaboration between the two vendors. To simplify communication during this transition, it is recommended to select a single appropriate channel and create a knowledge base in the project management system. Recording meetings and dividing the process into iterations can also help streamline the transition.

Confidentiality and ownership issues are also important considerations during a project handover. Non-disclosure agreements should be in place at the beginning of any collaboration. While it may be impossible to completely detach the development expertise gained from one project, it is possible to ensure that the project artifacts, such as documentation, design kit, and code, are securely stored. It is also important to have control over the credentials and ensure they cannot be changed without authorization.

In the outsourcing market, there are numerous services available at different levels of expertise and price segments. However, it is crucial to have a clear understanding of what you are looking for, your goals, and how much you are willing to invest. To successfully rescue a project, your new partner will require your time and attention. As the product owner, you hold the responsibility for the success of the project.

In conclusion, a successful project handover requires careful planning, clear objectives, and effective communication. By addressing potential challenges and risks, and ensuring the preservation of project integrity, you can ensure a smooth transition between software providers. With the right approach and collaboration, you can rescue a project and achieve your desired outcomes.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6259abc2d6a5c64a7c847158/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 07:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/25/map-of-nope-meme-why-youre-in-or-out-for-the-total-solar-eclipse/,‘Map Of Nope’ Meme: Why You’re In Or Out For The Total Solar Eclipse,"The upcoming total solar eclipse on April 8 is a rare celestial event that has captured the attention of many. However, not everyone understands the true significance of this phenomenon or knows where they should be to experience it. This is where the ""Map of Nope"" comes in. Created by eclipse cartographer Michael Zeiler on GreatAmericanEclipse.com, this map has become a popular tool for understanding the importance of being within the narrow path of totality.

The ""Map of Nope"" addresses a common problem: the lack of knowledge about total solar eclipses and the confusion between partial and total eclipses. Many well-intentioned individuals promote events and destinations that will not actually experience the total eclipse, leading people astray. This is partly due to event organizers wanting to capitalize on the eclipse's popularity, but it is also a result of ignorance about the distinction between a 99% partial eclipse and totality. As a result, those who truly want to witness the total solar eclipse are being misled.

To truly experience a total solar eclipse, precision is key. The word ""total"" means complete and absolute, and there is a stark difference between being within the path of totality and witnessing a partial eclipse. Dr. Rick Fienberg, Project Manager of the AAS Solar Eclipse Taskforce, aptly compares totality to pregnancy, stating that you can't be 99.9% pregnant—you either experience totality or you don't.

Cities like San Antonio, Fort Smith, Cincinnati, Columbus, Canton, and Youngstown will only experience a tragically near-yet-so-far 99% partial solar eclipse. Most residents in these areas may not even realize the difference. Only those within the path of totality will witness the sun being completely obscured by the moon for up to four and a half minutes. It will become dark, the temperature will drop, and people will have the opportunity to remove their solar eclipse glasses and see the sun's beautiful corona surrounding the moon with their naked eyes. It is an awe-inspiring sight that will leave a lasting impression. Outside the path of totality, even just a mile beyond the edge, people will only see a partial eclipse through solar eclipse glasses. It will not get dark, it will not get cold, and they will not see the sun's corona.

For those who are unable to travel and find themselves miles away from the path of totality, there is no need to worry. They can simply grab a pair of solar eclipse glasses and step outside to witness the partial eclipse. After all, they likely did not plan on traveling a long distance to experience the total solar eclipse, so they can still appreciate the partial eclipse.

However, for those who are just outside the path of totality, it is crucial to understand how close they are to something truly extraordinary. They need to move slightly north or south into the path to fully experience the eclipse. This is where the ""Map of Nope"" becomes invaluable. It provides a clear visual representation of the path of totality, helping people understand their proximity to this extraordinary event.

In conclusion, the ""Map of Nope"" is an essential tool for anyone planning to witness the total solar eclipse on April 8. It highlights the importance of being within the path of totality and dispels any misconceptions about partial eclipses. By using this map, individuals can plan their trip accordingly and ensure they have the opportunity to witness one of nature's most awe-inspiring spectacles. So, check out the ""Map of Nope"" and prepare for an unforgettable experience on April 8.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fc14ad8ed51dfc71501105/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1875,1054,x0,y162,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 07:00:00,Innovation,Innovation

He emphasizes the importance of a robust data strategy in harnessing the power of generative AI (GenAI). According to Santhanam, GenAI has the potential to elevate global GDP by $7 trillion and enhance productivity within the next decade. However, many organizations fail to move beyond preliminary evaluations of GenAI's use cases. Santhanam believes that tackling the deeper challenges of data management is crucial to unlocking the comprehensive benefits of GenAI and gaining a competitive edge.

Organizational data ecosystems are complex and fragmented, with disparate datasets scattered across various repositories such as data lakes, warehouses, cloud storage, SaaS platforms, IoT devices, analytical models, and on-premises systems. Companies have access to a vast array of data in different formats, from neatly organized tables and JSON files to rich media like images, videos, and audio files, as well as complex geospatial and vector data. However, turning this data into usable value is a formidable task.

One of the main challenges organizations face is understanding the entirety of their data landscape and effectively connecting and leveraging their data. As the volume of data escalates, these challenges become increasingly daunting. An ineffective data utilization strategy can impede data-driven decision-making and hinder continuous innovation.

To harness the full potential of data for generating insights and fostering innovation, organizations must establish a data foundation that simplifies data interaction throughout its lifecycle. This foundation should include a comprehensive set of tools, resources, and methodologies to cover all aspects of data management, from ingestion and storage to retrieval and analysis. It should also incorporate AI and machine learning technologies, such as large language models (LLMs), to derive valuable data-centric insights for end users.

An effective data foundation should encompass:
- A comprehensive set of tools that can handle the scale and variety of data, including generative AI
- The ability to integrate data stored and analyzed in different tools and systems to gain a better understanding of the business and make accurate predictions
- Governance of all data to securely provide access when and where users need it
- Built-in intelligence to accelerate and automate data management tasks for quick and easy access to data-driven insights

Data readiness is essential for the efficacy of a data strategy. Fundamental procedures such as data cleansing, validation, transformation, and storage are critical to preparing data for effective use.

While foundational models are widely accessible, organizations can gain a competitive edge by leveraging their proprietary datasets to develop impactful GenAI applications. The strategic use of exclusive data fuels innovation and generates real business results.

There are several ways organizations can leverage data in their generative AI applications. These methods range from easier to more complex implementation:
- Retrieval augmented generation (RAG): This method involves using private, sector-specific data to provide context and steer pre-trained models. For example, a sophisticated customer service chatbot could be created to handle diverse inquiries with precision, providing in-depth responses on product details, order statuses, shipping guidelines, and more.
- Finetuning a pre-trained model: This entails additional training of pre-trained models using industry-specific data. In the healthcare sector, for instance, refining a GenAI model with medical literature, anonymized patient records, and other relevant data could enhance its comprehension of medical language and procedures. This enhancement could lead to AI tools capable of aiding in disease diagnosis, treatment recommendation, or creating patient educational materials.
- Building and training your own large language models (LLMs) with vast amounts of data.

In conclusion, a robust data strategy is essential for harnessing the power of generative AI. Organizations must overcome the challenges of data management and establish a comprehensive data foundation to unlock the comprehensive benefits of GenAI. By leveraging their proprietary datasets and employing various data utilization methods, organizations can fuel innovation, generate real business results, and gain a competitive edge in the era of generative AI.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/648332de72aba3d31e2c5c61/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 07:30:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/apple-sued-microsofts-ai-ambitions-and-nvidia-surprises/,"Apple sued, Microsoft's AI ambitions and Nvidia's surprises","Welcome to the Week in Review! This week, we have some major news on Apple's antitrust lawsuit and Microsoft's AI ambitions. So, let's dive right in.

The U.S. has joined international regulators in accusing Apple of using monopolistic tactics to lock in iPhone users. In response, Apple claims that the actions taken by the Department of Justice (DOJ) could ruin what its users enjoy about its phones and ecosystem. While the DOJ's lawsuit draws a comparison between Apple and Microsoft in the 1990s, there are distinct differences between the two companies and their efforts to retain customers. However, experts predict that the lawsuit will not yield significant results in the short-term, estimating that it could take three to five years to reach a resolution.

Now, let's move on to other updates from the tech world. Microsoft made headlines this week by acquiring Inflection AI's co-founders. Mustafa Suleyman will now lead the consumer-facing unit Microsoft AI, while Karén Simonyan takes on the role of EVP and CEO of the same group. Inflection AI had previously raised $1.3 billion, with Microsoft being one of its major investors.

Nvidia's GTC event also made waves this week. While the company is known for its advancements in ray tracing technology, CEO Jensen Huang surprised attendees with a prediction that artificial general intelligence (AGI) is only five years away. Additionally, Nvidia announced a new AI platform for humanoid robots called GR00T.

In other news, Google and Apple are reportedly in talks to potentially deploy Google's AI model to power upcoming iOS updates. The nature of this collaboration remains uncertain, leaving us wondering whether it is a temporary measure until Apple's own AI efforts catch up, a long-term partnership, or an ongoing negotiation that may never materialize.

Moving on to hacking and privacy concerns, the Biden administration is forming an international coalition to combat commercial spyware. Interestingly, some investors participating in this coalition were previously involved in the very business they are now fighting against.

In the gaming world, a hack disrupted a $5 million Apex Legends tournament. The hackers claimed they did it ""for fun"" and to draw attention to the exploit used. Meanwhile, Glassdoor users have reported that their real names are being added to their profiles without their consent. The only solution provided to them is to delete their accounts entirely, prompting users to double-check their anonymity on the platform.

Now, let's shift our focus to funding and IPOs. Reddit had a strong start to its IPO, with its stock jumping 48% on its first day of trading. Astera Labs, a company specializing in connectivity hardware for cloud computing data centers, also experienced a successful IPO, with its stock closing 72% higher on day one. On a different note, The Browser Company, the startup behind the Arc browser, raised $50 million at a valuation of $550 million. While the company has launched numerous features and AI updates, its path to monetization remains unclear.

Lastly, in our bonus round, we explore why AI often struggles with spelling, despite its immense potential. We also cover Fisker's production pause due to financial difficulties. If the company fails to secure additional funding, it may have to cease operations. Finally, we discuss the importance of reviewing AI systems, even though they are inherently challenging to assess.

That wraps up this edition of Week in Review. Stay tuned for more exciting tech updates in the weeks to come.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/apple-antitrust-doj-splash.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-23 20:15:37,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/gostudent-tutoring-profitability/,"GoStudent, the online learning platform, says it's now profitable","GoStudent, the online tutoring marketplace based in Vienna, Austria, has achieved profitability alongside its valuation of $3.2 billion. The company, which boasts 11 million families and 23,000 tutors on its platform, has become one of the few Austrian startups to gain international recognition. Despite facing challenges during the market crash and subsequent decline in customer demand, GoStudent has successfully turned its fortunes around.

CEO Felix Ohswald, who co-founded the company in 2016 with COO Gregor Müller, emphasized that GoStudent is not just EBITDA profitable but also has positive operating cash flow across its global footprint. The company experienced tremendous growth from 2019 to 2022, reaching over €100 million in revenue. However, it also faced a cash burn of over €150 million in 2022 alone.

In response to the market downturn, GoStudent implemented significant cost-cutting measures and underwent multiple rounds of layoffs. These difficult decisions allowed the company to reduce its burn rate by 70% in 2023. Ohswald acknowledged that these restructuring periods were challenging but necessary for the company's survival. GoStudent learned valuable lessons about scaling, prioritizing key aspects, and being more cautious in its expansion plans.

GoStudent's success can be attributed to the surge in demand for online learning during the Covid-19 pandemic. The company transformed from being a convincing solution for online tutoring to becoming the go-to platform for students seeking educational support. Despite its popularity, GoStudent had to address its cash burn issue and make strategic adjustments. This included cutting back on expenses such as extravagant parties, acquisitions, and expansion into unestablished or highly competitive markets.

The company shifted its focus to Europe and adopted an organic growth strategy outside of German-speaking countries. Former chief growth officer Laura Warnier was replaced by chief marketing officer Dan Zbijowski, signaling a shift from top-line growth to bottom-line growth. GoStudent's ultimate goal remains to build the leading global school and help every student unlock their potential through personalized tutoring.

Although GoStudent primarily offers tutoring services, its acquisition of StudienKreis in 2022 indicates its evolving nature. StudienKreis, founded in 1974, has 1,000 physical learning centers, mostly in Germany. GoStudent plans to leverage these centers to enhance its hybrid learning approach. CEO Ohswald believes that the future of education lies in a hybrid model, combining technology with personalized tutoring to ensure each student receives the right support regardless of their location.

GoStudent's tutors primarily consist of university students, making it easier for them to establish connections with their pupils while providing academic assistance. The company aims to strike a balance between scaling at lower costs and maintaining a personalized approach to meet the demands of its customers.

GoStudent's journey to profitability has been marked by challenges and strategic adjustments. However, its ability to adapt and refocus its efforts has allowed it to thrive in the competitive online tutoring market. With a renewed focus on Europe and a commitment to hybrid learning, GoStudent is poised to continue its growth while unlocking the potential of students worldwide.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Founders-of-GoStudent-Gregor-Muller-I-Felix-Ohswald-2.jpg?w=1024,2024-03-25 11:00:36,Innovation,Innovation
