Samsung has made some interesting additions to the specifications of this foldable flip phone that will undoubtedly benefit both consumers and the company itself.

Let's start with the main details. The Galaxy Z Flip 6 will offer a choice between 8 GB or 12 GB of RAM, as well as a choice between 256 GB or 512 GB of storage. These options are in line with what we've come to expect from high-end smartphones in 2024. However, what really caught our attention is the choice of chipset for the device. Samsung has decided to go with a combination of Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 and its own Exynos 2400.

In the past, all Galaxy Z Flip 5 models came with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset, while the Galaxy S23 family of 2023 exclusively used Snapdragon. It was only a matter of time before Samsung took a similar approach with its leading flip phone, the Galaxy Z Flip 6. By mixing chips from both Qualcomm and its own Exynos, Samsung is able to leverage the strengths of each platform.

It's worth noting that these two chipsets are not identical in terms of performance. The Snapdragon platform is widely regarded as offering more power compared to Samsung's Exynos. While this performance gap is measurable in head-to-head comparisons on the Galaxy S24 handsets, the Exynos family excels in power efficiency and offers better battery life.

Unfortunately, consumers won't have the option to choose their preferred chipset. Instead, each sales region will receive either Exynos or Snapdragon, but not both. This may disappoint some who have a preference for one chipset over the other. However, with the specifications of the two chipsets being closer than in previous years, there is an advantage for Samsung in using its own Exynos 2400. Since it's their own chip, it will help reduce the overall cost of manufacturing the Galaxy Z Flip 6. In a market where foldable phones are becoming increasingly competitive, price is a major factor that consumers consider when comparing these devices to similar offerings from other brands like Oppo.

It's important to note that if someone is looking for the most powerful phone available, they may lean towards larger candy bar-styled phones, such as the Galaxy S24 Ultra. However, for those who value both functionality and form, foldable phones are the modern choice. And in this case, the slight performance loss due to the Exynos chipset is more than compensated by the more competitive pricing of the Galaxy Z Flip 6.

In conclusion, the upcoming Galaxy Z Flip 6 is set to make waves in the smartphone market. With its impressive specifications, including a choice between different RAM and storage options, as well as a combination of Snapdragon and Exynos chipsets, Samsung is catering to both power-hungry users and those looking for a more affordable option. The Z Flip 6 is certainly a device to keep an eye on as it hits the shelves in the coming months.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/03/25/ai-and-money-movement-human-guardrails-are-a-must/,AI And Money Movement: Human Guardrails Are A Must,"Dimitri Dadiomov, the co-founder and CEO of Modern Treasury, highlights the importance of thoughtful implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in payment operations. While AI has the potential to revolutionize various industries, payment operations require meticulous accuracy and human management to maintain a company's reputation. To achieve this, payment operations software should be used alongside AI to provide guardrails and ensure the benefits of efficiency can be realized.

A research conducted by consulting firm Edgar, Dunn & Company reveals that payment professionals worldwide anticipate an increase in the use of AI and machine learning. The primary use cases for AI in payment operations include fraud detection and improving customer service. AI is particularly well-suited to address challenges in payment operations that involve repetitive workflows, such as data translation, transaction reconciliation, and processing large amounts of data for human review.

Moreover, AI can play a significant role in areas of payment operations where the risk of errors is low. For instance, AI can effectively handle customer inquiries about the status of payments. It can also expedite notifications and investigations, enhancing customer service. Additionally, AI can assist in determining the most suitable payment rail for each transaction, considering factors such as risk, speed, and cost. By analyzing the context of a payment, AI can make informed decisions about the best payment rail to utilize.

Furthermore, AI has the potential to optimize the allocation of funds. For example, if a company needs to have $1 million in cash at all times but is willing to invest the remaining funds in high-interest accounts, an AI-powered application can identify and manage those accounts while ensuring that the required amount is readily available.

However, it is crucial to acknowledge that AI should be supported by human oversight, particularly in reconciliation processes. Accuracy is paramount when it comes to financial transactions. While payment reconciliation software may be highly accurate, exceptions may arise in certain cases, such as payments with different names or misspellings. AI can assist in suggesting the appropriate allocation of payments, but human intervention is necessary to review and reconcile the transactions. This collaboration between AI and human expertise ensures 100% reconciliation while enhancing productivity.

When considering the implementation of AI in payment operations, several questions should be considered. Firstly, it is essential to assess the risk versus reward of allowing AI to make decisions. While notifications and research tasks present minimal risks, the stakes are higher when it comes to making payments or reconciling them. A wrong payment can be difficult to recover, emphasizing the need for caution.

Secondly, safeguards must be in place to regulate AI tools, just as restrictions are imposed on human workers involved in money movement. Access to different capabilities should be carefully controlled, and rigorous protocols should apply to AI-powered applications.

Furthermore, the pursuit of perfection is paramount in payment operations. A generative AI tool may make minor mistakes, which can be rectified. However, when it comes to payments, accuracy in both the amount and timing is crucial. Companies that fail to deliver on this expectation must work hard to regain the trust of their customers.

Lastly, the deployment of AI should ultimately free workers from mundane tasks and routine operations. Automation of these tasks is essential for businesses to stay competitive in a technology-driven economy. Therefore, it is crucial to consider whether AI implementation will truly alleviate workers from these responsibilities.

In summary, while AI possesses the potential to revolutionize payment operations, its integration must be approached thoughtfully and with human management. AI can greatly improve efficiency and accuracy in payment operations, particularly in areas such as fraud detection, customer service, notifications, investigations, and decision-making. However, the implementation of AI must be accompanied by safeguards, careful control, and human oversight to ensure the accuracy and reliability that payment operations demand.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fdc40b985d05a8654469f7/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 08:15:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/03/25/a-psychologist-shares-2-ways-to-stop-jumping-to-conclusions/,A Psychologist Shares 2 Ways To Stop Jumping To Conclusions,"How to Avoid Snap Judgements: A Guide to Mindful Decision-Making

In the heat of the moment, it's easy to make snap judgements without sufficient evidence. This tendency, known as the ""jumping to conclusions"" bias, can lead to misunderstandings, poor decision-making, and strained relationships. But fear not, because there are effective methods to help you avoid falling into this trap. In this article, we'll explore two research-backed strategies that can help you make more informed and accurate judgments.

1. Practice Mindful Decision-Making

Patience is key when it comes to avoiding snap judgements. Mindfulness, which involves being present in the moment and non-judgmentally observing your thoughts and feelings, can foster the patience needed for mindful decision-making.

A 2019 study published in the journal Frontiers of Psychology emphasized the importance of mindfulness in conjunction with critical thinking. The researchers found that without mindfulness, critical thinking can unintentionally lead to psychological distress and cognitive distortions.

To practice mindful decision-making, start by setting a clear intention for the outcome you desire. Take a moment to reflect on how your decision or response aligns with your long-term goals, values, and the person you want to be. This self-reflection will help you respond mindfully instead of automatically reacting to a situation.

2. Challenge Your Thoughts

Jumping to conclusions can be a quick way to navigate uncertain situations. However, it often leads to inaccurate judgments and poor interpersonal outcomes. To break free from this pattern, it's important to identify unhelpful thought patterns and challenge their validity.

A study published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences found that practicing positive thinking can decrease the tendency to jump to conclusions. By consistently engaging in positive thinking, you can replace negative thought patterns with more positive ones. This not only enhances your decision-making skills but also improves your overall well-being.

The next time you find yourself assuming the worst in a situation, try seeking alternate explanations. For example, when someone cuts you off while driving, it's easy to assume they're rude and a nuisance to society. However, consider other possibilities such as them being late for an important event or rushing to the hospital due to a family emergency. While it doesn't excuse their behavior, it can help you balance your frustration with understanding.

Similarly, if your partner is late to meet you and their phone is off, it's natural to assume the worst. However, consider other possibilities such as them being stuck at work or in traffic with a dead phone, or even having lost their phone. By considering all possibilities and separating facts from opinions, you can reach more reasonable conclusions.

One effective exercise used in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is keeping a ""thought journal."" In this journal, you write about daily events along with your exact thoughts, feelings, and reactions. This allows you to reflect on your thoughts and identify any cognitive distortions.

If you catch yourself making unwarranted assumptions, take a moment to pause and write down the triggering situation. For example, if you gave a presentation and received no feedback, you might immediately think, ""I probably did a terrible job and everyone was nice enough not to say anything."" However, by asking yourself if you have sufficient evidence to support your assumptions and if there might be a more helpful explanation, you can challenge your initial thoughts. You might then think, ""Maybe there was no time afterwards for people to provide feedback. I may have done perfectly well, and someone will let me know if there are any areas for improvement.""

This exercise helps you spot instances of mind reading, ruminating, or fortune telling and encourages you to gradually change your thinking patterns. With practice, you can foster a healthier, more balanced, and compassionate inner narrative.

In conclusion, avoiding snap judgements is crucial for making informed and accurate decisions. By practicing mindful decision-making and challenging your thoughts, you can break free from the habit of jumping to conclusions. Remember, patience and self-reflection are key. So the next time you find yourself ready to make a snap judgement, take a moment to gather more information and consider alternative explanations. Your relationships, decision-making skills, and overall well-being will thank you.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fd85452557c6af2b31a467/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2978,1395,x0,y106,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 08:30:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/dma-first-formal-probes/,"Apple, Google and Meta face first formal investigations under EU's DMA","The European Union (EU) has recently announced a series of investigations on major tech companies, which are collectively referred to as gatekeepers under the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Alphabet/Google, Apple, and Meta (formerly known as Facebook) are the first companies to face formal non-compliance investigations under the EU's revamped competition rules.

The investigations will focus on specific areas where the companies may be breaching the rulebook. For Alphabet/Google, the EU will examine its rules on steering in Google Play and its approach to self-preferencing in search results. Apple's rules on steering in the App Store and the design of choice screens for alternatives to its Safari web browser are also under scrutiny. Additionally, Meta's ""pay or consent"" model will be investigated by the EU Commission.

These three companies were designated as gatekeepers under the pan-EU regulation last fall. The investigations aim to determine whether they have violated the rulebook, as suspected by the Commission. Violations of the DMA can result in fines of up to 10% of global annual turnover, and repeat offenses can lead to fines of up to 20%.

The EU will have up to 12 months to conclude the investigations, with a preliminary report expected within six months.

This enforcement action by the EU comes at a time when antitrust scrutiny on these three US tech giants is also increasing in their home country.

Since Alphabet, Apple, and Meta unveiled their plans to comply with the DMA, there has been criticism that their proposals do not align with the new EU law.

For example, Google has been accused of trying to bypass the ban on self-preferencing by introducing new rich features in search results that unfairly compete with rivals. Apple's use of notifications to warn users of risks outside its ecosystem has been criticized by developers as ""scare screens."" Meta's ""pay or be tracked"" tactic has also faced condemnation from privacy and consumer rights groups.

The Commission has initiated proceedings to assess whether Alphabet and Apple have breached the DMA's obligations concerning app stores. The DMA requires gatekeepers to allow app developers to ""steer"" consumers to offers outside their app stores free of charge. The Commission expressed concerns that the measures implemented by Alphabet and Apple may not fully comply as they impose various restrictions and limitations, such as constraints on developers' ability to communicate and promote offers.

Regarding Google's self-preferencing, the EU investigation will focus on Google's vertical search services, such as Google Shopping, Flights, and Hotels. The impact of these actions on similar rival services will be examined to ensure fair and non-discriminatory treatment, as required by the DMA.

The EU will also investigate Apple's compliance with user choice obligations on iOS, including the ability to easily uninstall apps, change default settings, and prompt users with choice screens for alternative default services like browsers and search engines on their iPhones. The Commission has concerns that Apple's measures, including the design of the web browser choice screen, may prevent users from exercising their choice of services within the Apple ecosystem, contravening the DMA.

As for Meta, the proceedings will assess whether its ""pay or consent"" model for EU users complies with the DMA. This model requires gatekeepers to obtain user consent when combining or cross-using their personal data across different core platform services. The Commission is concerned that Meta's binary choice may not provide a real alternative if users do not consent, thus failing to prevent the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers.

Margrethe Vestager, the Commission EVP in charge of competition policy, stated that the suggested solutions put forward by the three companies may not fully comply with the DMA. The Commission aims to investigate their compliance to ensure open and contestable digital markets in Europe.

The Digital Markets Act became applicable on March 7, and discussions with gatekeepers have been ongoing for months to aid their adaptation. While some changes are already visible in the market, the Commission remains skeptical about the adequacy of the solutions proposed by Alphabet, Apple, and Meta.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1031626648.jpg?resize=1200,799",2024-03-25 12:10:10,Innovation,Innovation
