PSCs have gained attention in the field of photovoltaic technologies due to their unique properties and low cost. However, their commercialization has been hindered by low power conversion efficiency and poor long-term stability.

To address these issues, the researchers introduced a novel multifunctional additive called potassium (4-tert-butoxycarbonylpiperazin-1-yl) methyl trifluoroborate (PTFBK) into the perovskite precursor solution. This additive effectively passivated defects and improved carrier extraction in perovskite films. Additionally, it enhanced the crystallization ability of perovskite, resulting in high-quality films with larger grain size.

The introduction of PTFBK had a synergistic effect, leading to the development of highly efficient rigid and flexible PSCs with power conversion efficiencies of 24.99% and 23.48%, respectively. The unencapsulated PTFBK-modified device also exhibited excellent thermal, humidity, and light stability under various conditions. It retained 85% of its initial efficiency after 5,000 bending cycles, demonstrating remarkable bending stability.

This research opens up new possibilities for the future development and commercialization of perovskite solar cells and related technologies. The study was published in the journal Angewandte Chemie International Edition.
