https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-vulnerability-virtual-reality.html,Vulnerability in virtual reality systems identified,"Virtual reality systems have become increasingly popular, offering users the opportunity to immerse themselves in a virtual world. However, a team of computer scientists at the University of Chicago has recently uncovered a potential vulnerability in these systems that could have serious implications. They have identified a way for hackers to insert what they refer to as an ""inception layer"" between a user's VR Home Screen and their VR User/Server.

In their paper, which has been published on the arXiv preprint server, the researchers outline how this vulnerability could be exploited. They describe a scenario in which hackers could add an app to a user's VR headset that tricks them into revealing sensitive information. By adding an inception layer, the hackers create a simulated VR app that runs inside the attacker's layer, making the user believe they are interacting with a legitimate VR app launched from the VR home screen.

The concept behind this app is inspired by the movie ""Inception,"" where a character played by Leonardo DiCaprio has an altered layer of reality downloaded into his brain. Similarly, the researchers propose that an inception layer could be used to record information entered by the user, such as a passcode for a virtual ATM. It could also intercept and modify information, such as altering cash amounts designated for a purchase and redirecting the difference to the hacker's bank account.

Moreover, the inception layer could introduce fake elements into the VR world, such as characters representing friends or family. This deceptive tactic could be used to gain the user's trust or access to confidential information. Essentially, the app could monitor or manipulate the user's gestures, voice activity, browsing behavior, and social or business interactions within the virtual environment.

To demonstrate the feasibility of this vulnerability, the researchers conducted an experiment involving 28 volunteers. These participants played a game using a demonstration VR headset, and the researchers then downloaded the app onto their devices to simulate a hacking scenario. Surprisingly, only 10 of the volunteers noticed a slight flickering during the download and activation process, and only one of them questioned whether something malicious was happening.

Upon discovering these findings, the research team promptly notified Meta, the company behind the Meta Quest VR system used in the experiment. Meta has responded by expressing its intention to investigate this potential vulnerability and address it if confirmed. The researchers emphasize that similar vulnerabilities are likely to exist in other VR systems and apps that attempt to insert themselves between users and their VR devices.

This discovery highlights the importance of addressing security concerns in virtual reality systems. As these systems become more integrated into our daily lives, it is crucial to ensure that users are protected from potential attacks. By raising awareness of this vulnerability, the research team hopes to inspire further research and development in this area to enhance the security of VR systems.

In conclusion, while virtual reality offers exciting possibilities, it is essential to remain vigilant against potential threats. The concept of an inception layer, as demonstrated by the University of Chicago researchers, reveals a significant vulnerability that could be exploited by hackers. By understanding and addressing these vulnerabilities, we can continue to enjoy the benefits of virtual reality while safeguarding our personal information and privacy.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/vulnerability-in-virtu.jpg,2024-03-25 10:20:02,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/can-you-hear-me-now-ai-coustics-to-fight-noisy-audio-with-generative-ai/,Can you hear me now? AI-coustics to fight noisy audio with generative AI,"Can you hear me now? AI-coustics to fight noisy audio with generative AI

Noisy recordings of interviews and speeches can be incredibly frustrating for audio engineers. However, a German startup called AI-coustics aims to solve this problem with its unique approach that utilizes generative AI to enhance the clarity of voices in videos.

Today, AI-coustics came out of stealth mode with €1.9 million in funding. According to Fabian Seipel, the co-founder and CEO of AI-coustics, their technology goes beyond standard noise suppression and can work with any device and speaker.

Seipel, who is an audio engineer, co-founded AI-coustics with Corvin Jaedicke, a machine learning lecturer at the Technical University of Berlin. They both experienced poor audio quality in online courses and tutorials during their studies at TU Berlin, which motivated them to work on improving speech quality and intelligibility.

""Our core mission is to make every digital interaction, whether it's a conference call, consumer device, or casual social media video, as clear as a broadcast from a professional studio,"" Seipel explained in an interview with TechCrunch.

The market for AI-powered noise-suppressing and voice-enhancing software is already quite robust. AI-coustics faces competition from companies like Insoundz, which uses generative AI to enhance streamed and pre-recorded speech clips, and Veed.io, a video editing suite with tools to remove background noise from clips.

However, AI-coustics claims to have a unique approach to developing the AI mechanisms that perform the noise reduction work. They train their model on speech samples recorded in their own Berlin studio. People are paid to record samples, which are then added to a dataset to train AI-coustics' noise-reducing model.

Seipel stated, ""We developed a unique approach to simulate audio artifacts and problems — e.g. noise, reverberation, compression, band-limited microphones, distortion, clipping and so on — during the training process.""

While AI-coustics' compensation scheme for creators may raise concerns, their focus on diversity in speech samples aims to combat bias. Seipel explained that size and diversity are crucial in eliminating bias and ensuring the technology works for all languages, speaker identities, ages, accents, and genders.

To test the effectiveness of AI-coustics' platform, I uploaded three video clips - an interview with an 18th-century farmer, a car driving demo, and an Israel-Palestine conflict protest. The processed clips had significantly less background noise, thus delivering on AI-coustics' promise of boosting clarity.

Seipel envisions AI-coustics' technology being used for real-time speech enhancement as well as recorded speech. It could potentially be embedded in devices like soundbars, smartphones, and headphones to automatically improve voice clarity. Currently, AI-coustics offers a web app and API for post-processing audio and video recordings, as well as an SDK for integrating their platform into existing workflows, apps, and hardware.

AI-coustics generates revenue through a combination of subscriptions, on-demand pricing, and licensing. They currently have five enterprise customers and 20,000 users, although not all of them are paying customers. Their roadmap includes expanding their team and improving the underlying speech-enhancing model.

Seipel mentioned, ""Prior to our initial investment, AI-coustics ran a fairly lean operation with a low burn rate in order to survive the difficulties of the VC investment market. AI-coustics now has a substantial network of investors and mentors in Germany and the U.K. for advice.""

AI-coustics' innovative approach to enhancing audio clarity through generative AI shows promise in addressing the challenges of poor audio quality in digital communications. By utilizing diverse speech samples and continuously improving their technology, AI-coustics aims to make every digital interaction as clear and intelligible as possible.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1009979808.jpg?resize=1200,801",2024-03-25 18:43:01,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.zdnet.com/article/saving-hours-of-work-with-ai-how-chatgpt-became-my-virtual-assistant-for-a-data-project/,Saving hours of work with AI: How ChatGPT became my virtual assistant for a data project,"Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been getting a lot of attention lately. We often read about the amazing capabilities of tools like ChatGPT. However, it's important to remember that these AI tools are just that - tools. They can be used to assist with projects, much like other productivity software.

Today, I want to share with you a project where ChatGPT saved me hours of work. While you may not have a similar project, I hope my thought process and prompts will inspire you to use ChatGPT for your own projects.

The project I was working on is what I like to call a ""stunt article."" These are fun projects that I know readers will be interested in. In this particular article, I wanted to explore how much computer gear I could buy from Temu for under $100. I managed to come in at $99.77.

To put the article together, I needed to find items on the Temu site to feature. For example, I discovered an iPad keyboard and mouse that cost about $6.

To stay within my $100 budget, I wanted to add all the Temu links to a spreadsheet, find the price for each item, and rearrange things until I reached my desired total budget.

However, the challenge was converting the Temu links into something useful. That's where ChatGPT came in.

Phase 1: Gathering the links

The first step was to gather all the links. I copied each link from Temu and pasted it into a Notion page. Notion allows you to create bookmark blocks that not only contain links but also product names. Here's a snapshot of the page:

[Insert Snapshot]

Phase 2: Identifying the data

Let's take a closer look at one of the data blocks. There are three key elements: the product name, the base URL, and some tracking data. We only need the product name and the URL. Here's an example:

[Insert Example]

Phase 3: Teaching ChatGPT to recognize the data

To teach ChatGPT to recognize and extract the relevant data, I fed it a prompt that instructed it to accept the data and await further instructions. Then, I copied the information from the Notion page and pasted it into ChatGPT.

The next step was crucial. I wanted ChatGPT to extract the titles and links while discarding the rest. I provided a prompt that explained this task to ChatGPT. This prompt allowed me to name the data and test whether ChatGPT understood the assignment.

ChatGPT successfully completed the assignment, although it stopped before finishing due to buffer limitations. I prompted it to continue, and it provided the remaining data.

Doing this process manually would have been time-consuming and tedious. With ChatGPT, it took less than a minute.

Phase 4: Cleaning up Temu's titles

Temu's product titles were overly complex for my project. I wanted to simplify them. For example, instead of ""10 Inch LCD Writing Tablet, Electronic Memo With Leather Protective Case, Electronic Drawing Board For Digital Handwriting Pad Doodle Board, Gifts For,"" I preferred ""LCD writing tablet with case.""

I assigned this task to ChatGPT as well, reminding it that it had already parsed and identified the data. I find that reminding ChatGPT about previous steps helps it incorporate the information more reliably.

By using ChatGPT, I was able to save hours of manual work and complete the project efficiently. The AI tool proved to be a valuable asset.

Remember, generative AI tools like ChatGPT are not magical solutions. They are tools that can assist us in our projects. With a little creativity and experimentation, you can leverage these tools to boost your productivity and achieve impressive results.

In conclusion, ChatGPT proved to be a useful workhorse for my project. Its ability to extract and manipulate data saved me valuable time and effort. I encourage you to explore the possibilities of using AI tools like ChatGPT in your own projects. Who knows, you might discover new ways to enhance your productivity and create engaging content.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/70d8814af33b190ff84b8faa5f9bafe13d3586e2/2024/03/25/7d1cb1ff-3bb7-4972-a6cd-33d04da76bc1/cover.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/boeing-ceo-to-leave-company-by-year-end-after-a-wave-of-safety-incidents/,Boeing CEO to leave company by year-end after a wave of safety incidents,"Boeing CEO David Calhoun is set to step down from his position by the end of 2024, following a series of safety incidents that have plagued the company. The decision comes in the wake of a cabin panel blowout on one of Boeing's planes, as well as several other significant safety issues. These incidents have raised concerns about the company's commitment to ensuring passenger safety and have prompted a reevaluation of its leadership.

Boeing, known for its innovation and technological advancements in aviation, operates an innovation acceleration program called Aerospace Xelerated. This program, formerly known as the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI), focuses on collaborating with startups in the aerospace industry. The departure of Calhoun raises questions about how this program will be impacted, and whether there will be any changes in its direction or management. TechCrunch has reached out to Aerospace Xelerated for comment on the matter.

In a statement released by the company, Calhoun expressed his intention to continue working on stabilizing and positioning Boeing for future success in the coming months. The company is currently facing one of its biggest safety crises, with a recent incident involving an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 jet. The emergency landing of this aircraft led to the grounding of 171 Max 9 jets for several weeks. This event has further exacerbated the safety concerns surrounding Boeing, following the crashes of two Max 8 jets in 2018 and 2019, which resulted in the tragic deaths of 346 individuals.

In addition to Calhoun's departure, Stan Deal, who currently leads Boeing's commercial airplanes business (BCA), will also be leaving the company. Stephanie Pope, the Chief Operating Officer of Boeing since January, has been appointed to lead BCA. Prior to her current role, Pope served as the President and CEO of Boeing Global Services, where she oversaw the company's aerospace services for commercial, government, and aviation industry clients worldwide.

This is a developing story, and more information will be provided as it becomes available. The departure of Calhoun and Deal, along with the appointment of Pope, marks a significant shift in leadership for Boeing. It remains to be seen how these changes will impact the company's operations and its commitment to safety moving forward. Boeing must prioritize regaining the trust of the public and the aviation industry by implementing robust safety measures and ensuring transparency in its operations.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1910140688.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-25 12:48:28,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/lesliekatz/2024/03/25/heres-proof-that-spiders-pretend-to-be-ants/,Here’s Fossilized Proof That Spiders Pretend To Be Ants,"In the world of nature, survival is a constant battle. Animals must find ways to avoid becoming prey, and some have developed incredible strategies to do so. Take spiders, for example. These little creatures have found a way to disguise themselves as ants in order to stay alive.

But why ants? Well, ants are known for their aggressive defense mechanisms. They have strong bites and stinging venom, and they can call in reinforcements from their nestmates. These traits make them less appealing to other predators. Spiders, on the other hand, have no chemical defenses and are typically solitary creatures. This makes them vulnerable to larger spiders, wasps, and birds. By mimicking ants, spiders are more likely to go unnoticed and avoid becoming a meal.

One scientist who has studied this fascinating phenomenon is George Poinar Jr., a paleobiologist and professor emeritus at Oregon State University. Poinar recently published a study describing a new species of ant-mimicking spider that was found trapped in fossilized resin. The spider was remarkably well-preserved, except for the tips of its legs. While ant-mimicking spiders are found all over the world, they have rarely been discovered in fossil form.

Sticky tree resin, when it hardens and fossilizes, becomes amber or copal. These materials often trap and preserve small organisms, giving us a glimpse into the past. Poinar is an expert in studying these fossilized specimens and has examined everything from insects to flowers to ancient fungus. The spider in his study was found in copal from Medellin, Colombia, which can be up to 3 million years old.

The ability of creatures to mimic other life forms is a common survival strategy in nature. Many animals change their colors or patterns to blend in with their surroundings. However, spiders face a unique challenge in mimicking ants. Ants have six legs and two long antennae, while spiders have eight legs and no antennae. To imitate ants, spiders must reposition their front legs to look like antennae. They also have to modify other parts of their body to closely resemble ants.

Scientists believe that this morphing ability is the result of spider mutation, adaptation, and natural selection. However, Poinar suggests that there may be more to it. He believes that spiders use reasoning and intelligence when mimicking ants, often modeling their body changes after specific ants in their environment. This challenges the long-held belief that all insect behavior is purely instinctual.

While ant-mimicking spiders may be masters of disguise, their abilities come at a cost. Other studies have shown that the changes required to mimic ants can impair spiders' own hunting abilities. It seems that these spiders have traded some of their hunting prowess for the chance to avoid becoming someone else's dinner.

In conclusion, the world of nature never ceases to amaze us with its ingenuity. Spiders that mimic ants are just one example of the incredible adaptations that animals have developed to survive. Thanks to researchers like George Poinar Jr., we are able to learn more about these fascinating creatures and the secrets they hold in their ancient pasts.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6601d75147f6aaf277e73ba1/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=527,297,x0,y132,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 15:28:10,Innovation,Innovation

Reinoso is a passionate advocate for educating and training students in computer science disciplines to prepare them for future careers. He has championed this initiative throughout his career, whether in venture capitalism, consulting, or his role as the D.C. deputy mayor for education. At Amazon, Reinoso has the opportunity to bring all of these experiences together to invest in innovations and nonprofit partnerships that will inspire and prepare young people for the careers of the future.

Integrating AI education into school curriculums comes with its challenges. While there is a strong desire among teachers to deliver AI content to students, they often lack the necessary tools and expertise. According to a recent survey conducted by Amazon and Access Partnership, 60% of educators believe that foundational AI skills should be taught from Grade 6 through university. However, nearly 70% of educators lack the resources to teach the subject.

AI is becoming an integral part of our daily lives, and it is crucial to address this education gap. One way to do so is by funding educator training. Amazon supports professional development for teachers to help school districts and educators implement sustainable K-12 STEM education initiatives and improve job readiness.

Another way to bridge the education gap is by increasing awareness of and access to AI tools and curriculum. There are plenty of free resources available, such as Amazon's AI Ready commitment, which aims to provide free AI skills training to two million people by 2025. Amazon has launched several initiatives, including Hour of Code Dance Party: AI Edition in collaboration with Code.org, which introduces K-12 students and teachers to coding and generative AI.

Additionally, Amazon is offering Generative AI Scholarships through Amazon Web Services (AWS) to more than 50,000 high school and university students globally. These scholarships provide access to a new generative AI course on Udacity for free.

As AI continues to evolve, responsible stewardship will be crucial to guide its application.

In conclusion, Amazon is at the forefront of AI innovation and is committed to bringing AI education to classrooms around the world. By addressing the AI education gap, funding educator training, and providing access to tools and curriculum, Amazon is empowering students and educators to embrace the potential of AI and prepare for the careers of the future. With responsible AI use as a core focus, Amazon is ensuring that AI is used ethically and responsibly.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/08bc5883c45c188259ecb098a51ea114dc119601/2024/03/25/38b15b64-4b2d-45b8-8147-39fda8737c67/amazon-future-engineer-career-discovery-day-20231024-bsd-students-1010.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 10:59:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/profluent-spurred-by-salesforce-research-and-backed-by-jeff-dean-uses-ai-to-discover-medicines/,"Profluent, spurred by Salesforce research and backed by Jeff Dean, uses AI to discover medicines","Last year, Salesforce launched a project called ProGen, which aimed to design proteins using generative AI. The goal of this research moonshot was to uncover medical treatments more efficiently than traditional methods. Although ProGen successfully created the 3D structures of artificial proteins, it didn't have much commercial impact. However, one of the researchers involved, Ali Madani, has now founded a company called Profluent to bring protein-generating technology to pharmaceutical companies.

Madani's mission with Profluent is to ""reverse the drug development paradigm"" by starting with patient and therapeutic needs and creating customized treatment solutions. The company aims to apply generative AI to gene editing, optimizing multiple attributes simultaneously to design personalized gene editors for each patient. This approach is particularly valuable for genetic diseases that cannot be treated with proteins directly from nature or through existing gene editing systems.

Profluent is not the first company to explore the use of generative AI in predicting proteins. Nvidia, Meta, and DeepMind have all made significant advancements in this area. Profluent, however, stands out by training its AI models on massive data sets with over 40 billion protein sequences. The startup plans to collaborate with external partners to develop ""genetic medicines"" that have the highest chances of approval.

Madani believes that Profluent's approach can revolutionize the drug development process by significantly reducing the time and capital required for treatment development. Currently, it takes an average of 10-15 years and costs several hundred million to billions of dollars to develop a new medicine. By intentionally designing solutions using generative AI, Profluent aims to move away from accidental discoveries and towards purposeful innovation in biology.

Profluent, based in Berkeley, has already secured significant funding from venture capital firms such as Spark Capital, Insight Partners, and Air Street Capital. Additionally, notable figures like Google's chief scientist Jeff Dean have supported the company.

https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-favorite-linux-text-editors-and-why-you-should-be-using-one/,My favorite Linux text editors (and why you should be using one),"Linux has a long history of text editors, with the infamous editor wars between emacs and vi being a prominent example. However, the role of text editors has evolved over time. While they were initially used primarily for configuring Linux and writing code, they now have a much broader range of applications. Text editors can be used for note-taking, journaling, and even writing novels. Personally, I have used text editors for short stories and flash fiction, although I have yet to write a full-length book using one.

Before I proceed, I want to clarify that this list does not include vi or Emacs. While both of these editors are undeniably powerful, I find them to be more of a hindrance than a help. They are not suitable for everyday use or for the average user, which is the focus of this article. However, if you find the editors listed here to be too simple or lacking in flexibility, you can always rely on vi or Emacs for coding, configuring, and administering purposes.

Now, let's dive into the list of text editors that are easier to use but still effective.

1. Nano
Nano has been my go-to text editor for decades. It may be basic, but it gets the job done. Nano includes all the essential features I need in an editor, without overwhelming me with unnecessary complexities. With nano, you can write simple flat text files without any formatting. It offers interactive search-and-replace, undo/redo functionality, syntax coloring, smooth scrolling, auto-indentation, go-to-line-and-column-number, feature toggles, file locking, and internationalization support.

It's important to note that Nano is a terminal application, meaning it lacks a graphical user interface. To open Nano, you simply open the terminal and issue the command ""nano filename"" (replace ""filename"" with the name of the file you want to edit or create). There are several options available, such as ""--backup"" (which creates a backup of the previous version of the file), ""--tabstospaces"" (which converts typed tabs to spaces), ""--locking"" (which locks the file while editing), ""--smooth"" (for smooth scrolling), and many more.

Nano is free and comes pre-installed with most Linux distributions.

2. Gedit
Gedit is the default text editor for the GNOME desktop environment. It is a basic yet effective graphical application. Gedit offers features like tabs, support for internationalized text (UTF-8), syntax highlighting, markdown support, configurable fonts and colors, print support, auto-save, auto backup creation, keyboard shortcuts, theming, and full-screen mode.

What sells me on Gedit is its simplicity. While I typically default to nano, I turn to Gedit when I need a graphical user interface. One of the main reasons I keep Gedit around is that opening the nano editor from a terminal window doesn't work as seamlessly when clicking on a text file link. Gedit also offers fullscreen mode, which allows me to edit text files without distractions.

Gedit is free and comes pre-installed with most GNOME-based desktop distributions.

3. COSMIC Text Editor
COSMIC Text Editor will be the default text editor for System76's COSMIC desktop once it's released. However, the COSMIC Text Editor is already showing great progress and promises to be the Gedit equivalent for COSMIC. COSMIC Text Editor will include features such as syntax highlighting, standard keyboard shortcuts, find functionality, spellcheck, project support, revert changes, document statistics, and even Git management support.

Although I rarely prefer dark themes, COSMIC Text Editor's dark theme seems fitting. Like Gedit, COSMIC Text Editor is simple to use and can handle basic tasks as well as more complex ones like coding. If you use Pop!_OS, you can get a taste of what COSMIC Text Editor will look and feel like by installing it from the Pop Shop.

COSMIC Text Editor will be free and officially available when the COSMIC Desktop OS is released.

4. Kate
Kate is to KDE Plasma what Gedit is to GNOME. The main difference is that Kate offers a few additional features, such as multi-cursor and multi-cursor selection. These features allow you to select and manipulate multiple strings of text simultaneously. Kate also offers project support, syntax highlighting, standard keyboard shortcuts, and plugins. With plugins, you can extend Kate's functionality to include features like SQL query support, GDB debugging, one-click project build, and more. Think of Kate as a supercharged version of Gedit that can also handle simple text file creation and editing.

Kate is a versatile text editor that caters to more advanced users who need additional features beyond the basics. It's free and available for use with KDE Plasma.

In conclusion, while vi and Emacs may still have their loyal followers, there are plenty of other text editors available for Linux users. Whether you prefer a simple terminal-based editor like Nano, a GUI editor like Gedit, a upcoming editor like COSMIC Text Editor, or a feature-rich editor like Kate, you have options to suit your needs. Find the one that works best for you, and happy editing!",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/feda4ca65eefc13df0e3505780d84330ecd3c713/2024/03/25/d964a97e-9c56-444a-9497-19bc7ca26a56/typingclosegettyimages-1341060766.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation

Canoo, which is aiming to move from prototypes to commercial production, purchased the assets, which will be shipped to its facility in Oklahoma. The acquisition does not include any of Arrival's intellectual property. Arrival, once valued at over $13 billion, filed for bankruptcy protection in the UK and announced plans to sell off assets and IP from its UK division. Canoo, on the other hand, has faced its own challenges in producing EVs and converting sales into deliveries. The company has resorted to stock splits and issuing more shares to stay afloat.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/canoo-walmart-arkansas.jpg?resize=1200,670",2024-03-25 22:15:20,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.reuters.com/technology/digital-world-shares-surges-it-completes-merger-with-trumps-truth-social-2024-03-25/,Digital World shares surge on merger with Trump's Truth Social,"Shares of Digital World Acquisition (DWAC.O) surged over 40% on Monday following the completion of its merger with the Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG). TMTG, backed by former U.S. President Donald Trump, owns the social media platform Truth Social. The merger was approved by Digital World shareholders on Friday, providing a financial boost to Trump as he faces legal battles and prepares for the 2024 U.S. presidential elections. Digital World shares rose to $51.80, recouping losses from the previous session, and are set to begin trading on Nasdaq on Tuesday with tickers ""DJT"" and ""DJTWW."" The merger brings a $300 million cash infusion to Truth Social, which had reported losses of $10.6 million in the first nine months of 2023 on revenue of $3.4 million. Trump's stake in the combined company is valued at approximately $3.3 billion.

In a separate legal development, a New York state appeals court granted Trump a temporary pause on his $454 million civil fraud judgment, allowing him to post a smaller $175 million bond within 10 days. This move prevents the seizure of his assets by state authorities. However, a New York Supreme Court judge has scheduled the trial for Trump's criminal charges, related to hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, to begin on April 15. This sets the stage for Trump to become the first former U.S. president to face criminal charges in a trial.

It's worth noting that the merger between Digital World Acquisition and Trump Media & Technology Group represents a significant development in the world of social media and politics. The creation of Truth Social, with Trump at the helm, has the potential to disrupt the current landscape and provide an alternative platform for conservative voices. With Trump's high-profile involvement and the financial injection from the merger, Truth Social will likely attract attention and scrutiny in the coming months.

The completion of this merger also marks a significant milestone for Digital World Acquisition. The company, originally formed as a blank check company, has successfully executed its strategy by merging with a high-profile partner. This not only validates Digital World's business model but also positions the company for future growth and success.

As shares of Digital World surged and Trump's stake in the combined company reached a substantial valuation, it is clear that investors are optimistic about the potential of this venture. The financial boost provided by the merger will undoubtedly strengthen Truth Social's operations and allow the platform to compete with established social media giants. With Trump's involvement, the platform is likely to attract a dedicated user base and generate significant attention in the political and media spheres.

However, it is important to note the legal challenges that Trump continues to face. While the temporary pause on the civil fraud judgment provides some relief, the scheduled trial for his criminal charges looms large. The outcome of this trial will have far-reaching implications, not only for Trump but also for the precedent it sets regarding the accountability of former U.S. presidents.

In conclusion, the completion of the merger between Digital World Acquisition and Trump Media & Technology Group has generated significant excitement and optimism in the markets. The creation of Truth Social, backed by former U.S. President Donald Trump, represents a potential disruption in the world of social media and politics. With a substantial financial infusion and Trump's high-profile involvement, Truth Social is poised to attract attention and compete with established platforms. However, it is important to acknowledge the legal challenges that Trump faces, as they will undoubtedly shape the future trajectory of his involvement in this venture.",https://www.reuters.com/pf/resources/images/reuters/reuters-default.webp?d=183,2024-03-25 17:00:08,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/london-regtech-gss-raises-47m-to-help-banks-screen-for-global-sanctions/,London regtech GSS raises $47M to help banks screen for global sanctions,"Global Screening Services (GSS), a London-based regulatory compliance platform, has successfully raised $47 million in funding. This comes at a time when economic sanctions are on the rise, with the United States imposing trade restrictions and asset blocking against countries such as Russia, China, and Iran.

GSS was founded by Tom Scampion, who previously served as the head of financial crime for Deloitte's EMEA arm. In 2020, he became a general partner at consulting firm AlixPartner, where GSS was initially incubated before becoming an independent entity in 2021. Last year, GSS secured a similar amount of funding from prominent investors, including Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), one of the largest banks in the world. The company has now revealed the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), along with Cynosure Group and AlixPartner, as additional backers in this latest funding round.

Financial institutions, particularly banks, often find themselves at the forefront of sanctions enforcement due to their role in global money flow. However, it can be challenging to determine the origin and destination of funds. In 2019, Standard Chartered faced fines of $1.1 billion from regulators in the UK and the US for inadequate money-laundering controls and sanctions breaches, including those against Iran. Similarly, BNP Paribas was fined a staggering $8.9 billion in 2014 for processing financial transactions involving sanctioned countries.

Given these challenges, investors have shown increasing support for regulatory compliance businesses in recent years. For example, Droit, based in New York, raised $23 million in funding last year, while London's SteelEye secured $21 million in financing.

GSS offers a sanctions-screening platform that helps banks and financial institutions comply with regulations. Users input transaction data into GSS's cloud-based platform, which then compares the data against a standardized set of sanctions lists from around the world. GSS also enhances these lists with additional data points, such as dates of birth, International Maritime Organization (IMO) numbers for ships, and data from the financial transfer systems of sanctioned countries. The platform also provides ""enhanced"" lists for screening, including companies that are partially owned by sanctioned entities.

With the latest funding round, GSS is transitioning from the development phase to becoming fully operational. The company is preparing to launch its services and onboard its first customers.

In conclusion, Global Screening Services has secured $47 million in funding to support its regulatory compliance platform. This comes at a crucial time when economic sanctions are increasing, and financial institutions face significant challenges in ensuring compliance. GSS's innovative screening platform aims to simplify the process and help banks and other institutions meet their obligations effectively. With the additional funding, GSS is poised to make a significant impact in the industry and establish itself as a key player in the regulatory compliance space.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1770041999-e1711386339681.jpg?resize=1200,677",2024-03-25 18:36:37,Innovation,Innovation

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-high-efficiency-based-copperiodide-clusters.html,A high efficiency LED based on copper-iodide clusters,"A team of researchers led by Prof. Yao Hongbin from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) has made a significant breakthrough in LED technology. They have developed a high efficiency, high brightness warm white light-emitting diode (LED) based on copper-iodide cluster hybrids. This achievement has been published in Nature Photonics, a prestigious scientific journal.

Solution-processed LED devices are widely recognized as the future of large-area solid-state lighting due to their simple manufacturing process and high operability. Currently, there are solution-processed LEDs based on lead-halide perovskites, organic semiconductor materials, and colloidal core-shell quantum dots (QDs) that have achieved remarkable electroluminescence performance.

However, a major challenge lies in the environmental impact and high production costs associated with these materials. Lead-halide perovskites and CdSe QDs contain heavy metals that raise serious environmental concerns. On the other hand, LED devices based on organic light-emitting molecules, InP QDs, and ZnSe QDs have complex synthesis processes, leading to high production costs. Therefore, the development of solution-processed LEDs based on low-cost, low-toxicity, easily scalable, and highly efficient emitters is crucial for the advancement of solid-state lighting.

To address this challenge, Prof. Yao and his team designed and prepared a copper-iodine-based hybrid cluster with a broad photoluminescence spectrum. They achieved this by introducing nitrogen-phosphine chelating ligands and phosphine-containing solubilizing ligands. As a result, they obtained copper-iodide hybrid clusters that exhibited both high luminescence efficiency and high solubility. These clusters demonstrated a solubility of over 200 mg/mL and good structural stability in N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF), a cross-solvent used in LED production.

The team fabricated luminescent thin films using spin-coating in DMF, which showed a low surface roughness of 0.22 nm and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of over 70%. These thin films could be used as a luminescent layer to produce low-cost warm-white LED devices through an orthogonal solvent route.

The resulting LED devices achieved impressive performance metrics. They achieved a maximum external quantum efficiency of 19.1%, a brightness of over 40,000 cd m-2, and an operational lifetime of more than 232 hours (T 50 @100 cd m-2). Furthermore, the team successfully constructed a large-area solution-processed LED device with a working area of 36 cm2 using blade-coating. This LED device emitted warm white light with a brightness close to 60,000 cd m-2, showcasing its potential for practical applications.

Additionally, the team explored the development of color-tunable LED devices by modifying different electron-donating groups on the nitrogen heterocycles of the nitrogen-phosphine chelating ligands. This allowed them to achieve a series of solution-processed LED devices with tunable colors.

The development of high efficiency and high brightness LED devices based on copper-iodide hybrid clusters marks a significant advancement in the field. The structural expandability and spectral tunability of these hybrid clusters make them promising candidates for fabricating low-cost high-performance LED panels and solid-state lighting solutions.

This groundbreaking research opens up new possibilities for the future of LED technology. The team's innovative approach and successful outcomes pave the way for the development of more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly LED devices. As we continue to explore alternative materials and manufacturing processes, we move closer to a more sustainable and brighter future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/ustc-designs-high-effi.jpg,2024-03-25 13:17:52,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.reuters.com/technology/why-is-eu-probing-big-tech-under-digital-markets-act-2024-03-25/,Why is the EU probing Big Tech under the Digital Markets Act?,"The European Union has launched investigations into Alphabet (Google's parent company), Apple, and Meta (formerly known as Facebook) for potentially violating a new law aimed at preventing Big Tech from having an unfair advantage over competitors. The investigations come after the companies were given six months to comply with the rules, which aim to promote competition and give users more choice.

One of the main areas of investigation is ""anti-steering"" behavior, particularly related to Alphabet and Apple's payment systems. When making in-app purchases on iPhones or Android devices, such as ordering food or upgrading to a premium version of an app, Apple or Alphabet usually takes a cut of the fee. To avoid these extra charges, app developers sometimes steer consumers towards making payments directly on their own websites. Apple has already faced accusations of anti-steering behavior and was recently fined $2 billion by the EU for blocking users of music streaming services from accessing discounts and promotions outside its own payment ecosystem.

The EU is also investigating whether Apple and Google have prevented consumers from accessing offers outside their control. This involves examining whether tech companies prioritize their own products or services over those of their rivals, giving themselves an unfair competitive advantage. For example, the EU is looking into whether Google prioritizes its own services, such as Google Hotels or Google Flights, when users search for relevant information, potentially limiting business for competitors like Booking.com or Skyscanner.

Another aspect of the investigation focuses on self-preferencing. In physical retail, supermarkets sometimes display cheaper own-brand alternatives alongside more expensive products. In the digital realm, tech companies have been accused of displaying their own products more prominently than those of their rivals, thus gaining an unfair advantage. The EU is investigating whether Amazon engages in this practice, although it has not launched a formal investigation yet.

Under the new law, Apple was required to make it easier for users to uninstall software and change default settings. The EU has expressed concern that Apple has not made this choice as straightforward as it should be and will investigate further. Additionally, the law mandates that platforms obtain explicit consent from users before combining their data across different platforms. Meta introduced a ""pay or be tracked"" policy, which charges users who do not consent to data collection and combination. However, the EU has questioned the validity of this binary choice and will investigate whether it provides a real alternative for users.

Google has made significant changes to its services in response to the new rules and has stated that it will defend its approach during the investigations. Apple, on the other hand, is confident that its plan complies with the law. Meta has stated that it is trying to comply with the law's guidance and that its subscription-based alternative to advertising is designed to meet regulatory obligations.

The investigations by the European Union have significant implications for Big Tech companies. If violations are found, fines of up to 10% of a company's global annual turnover could be imposed. The EU Commission aims to conclude the probes within a year. These investigations reflect ongoing efforts by regulators to ensure fair competition in the digital space and protect consumer interests.

In conclusion, the European Union has launched investigations into Alphabet, Apple, and Meta for potentially breaching new laws aimed at preventing unfair advantages for Big Tech companies. The investigations cover areas such as anti-steering behavior, self-preferencing, and compliance with user choice and data protection requirements. The outcome of these investigations could have far-reaching consequences for the companies involved and the digital landscape as a whole.",https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TIZPIWP45JKDXPO77BPXMUWREY.jpg?auth=48ef9c0d62f27c890130fa8289d48f014eef6658b96a572fcf2f528f5dbaa8e3&width=1920&height=1005&smart=true,2024-03-25 16:36:59,Innovation,Innovation
