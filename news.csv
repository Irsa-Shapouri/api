The deal, which marks Borderless' first acquisition since its establishment in 2018, will bring AI-infused quant trading expertise to Borderless Capital and expand its presence into Latin America. The financial details of the acquisition have not been disclosed.

CTF Capital has developed trading models and capabilities that incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) strategy engines. They have also implemented automated market making (AMM), a decentralized exchange that utilizes algorithms to trade digital assets, and maximal extractable value (MEV) strategies. MEV strategies enable block miners to profit from manipulating transaction orders in decentralized finance. In the fast-paced world of web3, where tokens and blockchains can experience rapid fluctuations, the ability to trade quickly and efficiently is crucial for investment firms with a focus on cryptocurrency.

Following the acquisition, Borderless Capital's assets under management (AUM) will exceed $500 million. Borderless currently manages six funds, including a $50 million cross-chain fund and Algorand Fund. All the existing funds managed by CTF Capital will be merged into Borderless' Multi-Strategy Fund V LP, which was launched last year with $100 million under management. This multi-strategy fund is an open-ended hedge fund that aims to generate risk-adjusted maximum returns for investors in both liquid and soon-to-be-liquid digital assets.

With the addition of CTF Capital's team, Borderless Capital will have a total of nearly 40 employees. The 11 staff members from CTF Capital, including two partners, will join Borderless Capital.

David Garcia, co-founder and managing partner at Borderless Capital, highlighted CTF Capital's technological capabilities, stating that their team has been developing a machine learning and AI-powered blockchain investment platform for over three years. They have also been exploring innovative on-chain opportunities such as participating in the MEV markets.

In addition to technological advantages, Borderless Capital expects to benefit from the acquisition's financial capacity. The deal will bring new limited partners (LPs) from Latin America, which will help Borderless establish a stronger presence in the region and create new opportunities. Garcia emphasized that Borderless already has significant exposure to Latin America through its portfolio companies and a large number of investors and clients from the region. By opening a local office in Argentina, Borderless will be able to provide better and more personalized service to its Latin American partners.

Some of Borderless Capital's portfolio companies include Securitize, a platform for digital tokenized securities; Wormhole, a blockchain infrastructure company; Blockdaemon, a blockchain infrastructure company and one of Borderless' early unicorns; and Helium Network, a decentralized physical infrastructure network that offers wireless connectivity for IoT and mobile devices.

The acquisition of CTF Capital represents a strategic move for Borderless Capital, allowing them to expand their capabilities and establish a stronger presence in Latin America. With the addition of AI-infused quant trading expertise, Borderless Capital is well-positioned to navigate the rapidly evolving world of web3 and provide enhanced investment opportunities for its clients.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GettyImages-1174590894.jpg?resize=1200,720",2024-03-26 12:49:15,Innovation,Innovation
