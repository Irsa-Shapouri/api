https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/mallard-bay-airbnb-for-guided-hunting-and-fishing/,Mallard Bay is the Airbnb for guided hunting and fishing,"Americans have a deep love for fishing and hunting, as evidenced by the $144.8 billion spent on these activities in 2022 alone. However, the industry has largely remained offline, with bookings and payments being done through traditional methods like phone calls and physical checks. Mallard Bay, a Houston-based startup, aims to change that by providing a platform for hunters and fishermen to book guided tours online, similar to how they would book a hotel. Additionally, Mallard Bay offers a back office solution called Guidetech for outfitters to manage their operations and access additional services like marketing.

Recently, Mallard Bay announced a successful $4.6 million Series A funding round led by Soul Venture Partners, with participation from existing investor Acadian Capital Ventures and other angel investors. The idea for the company came to co-founder and CEO Logan Meaux after a disappointing hunting trip with his dad. He realized that there was a need for a platform that could streamline the booking process for guided hunts and provide a better experience for both hunters and outfitters.

Initially, Mallard Bay planned to create a marketplace similar to Airbnb, but they soon realized that they needed to offer more to attract guides and outfitters. This led them to develop Guidetech, which provides outfitters with the tools they need to manage their business online. By combining their passion for the outdoors with their expertise in the software space, Mallard Bay was able to create a compelling solution that resonated with outfitters.

The platform's success can be attributed to its ability to attract influential figures like Toby Brohlin, a hunting influencer, who has generated over $1 million in bookings. Overall, Mallard Bay facilitated over $6 million in bookings in 2023 and is projected to reach $30 million to $35 million in 2024.

Despite the market potential and the company's traction, Meaux faced challenges in securing investors. Many investors didn't understand the hunting and fishing category or its potential. Mallard Bay also had to address concerns about ethical hunting practices and conservation. Meaux emphasized that hunting and fishing, when done ethically, actually contribute to conservation efforts by ensuring sustainable wildlife management and preventing overpopulation.

While hunting and fishing may not be commonly discussed in the startup and tech ecosystem, Mallard Bay's success highlights the untapped opportunities in niche markets. The company's impressive growth, with bookings increasing by 600% year over year since its launch in 2021, demonstrates the demand for a modernized and streamlined hunting and fishing experience.

This need for innovation extends beyond hunting and fishing to other outdoor activities. Americans spent over $394 billion on outdoor activities, including hiking, birdwatching, and more. However, many of these industries still rely on outdated technology or lack user-friendly platforms. For example, finding parking for popular hiking trails can be a challenge, requiring individuals to piece together information from various sources.

Mallard Bay's success serves as a reminder that niche markets have immense potential. By addressing the specific needs of outdoor enthusiasts and providing convenient and user-friendly solutions, startups can tap into a significant market. The key is to understand the target audience and create innovative platforms that enhance their outdoor experiences.

In conclusion, Mallard Bay's transformation of the hunting and fishing industry through its online booking platform and back office solution has garnered attention and investment. The company's success reflects the untapped potential in niche markets and the need for modernized solutions in outdoor activities. As the market continues to grow, it's crucial for startups to identify specific pain points and develop innovative platforms that cater to the needs of outdoor enthusiasts. Mallard Bay's story is a testament to the power of combining passion, domain expertise, and creative solutions to disrupt traditional industries.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/greysen-johnson-cZVzzFadTMc-unsplash.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-23 16:00:34,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/apple-sued-microsofts-ai-ambitions-and-nvidia-surprises/,"Apple sued, Microsoft's AI ambitions and Nvidia's surprises","Welcome to the latest edition of our Week in Review! This week, we have some significant updates on the Apple antitrust lawsuit and Microsoft's AI advancements. Let's jump right in.

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has joined international regulators in accusing Apple of using monopolistic tactics to lock in iPhone users. In response, Apple argues that the DOJ's actions could jeopardize the very aspects that its users love about its phones and ecosystem.

While the lawsuit draws a comparison between Apple and Microsoft in the 1990s, it's important to note that there are distinct differences between the two companies and their approaches to retaining customers. However, experts believe that the lawsuit will not yield immediate results, as it may take three to five years to reach a resolution.

Moving on to other news, Microsoft recently acquired the co-founders of the prominent AI startup, Inflection AI. This deal positions Mustafa Suleyman as the lead of Microsoft AI's consumer-facing unit and Kar√©n Simonyan as the EVP and CEO of the same group. Inflection AI had previously raised $1.3 billion, with Microsoft being its largest investor.

At Nvidia's GTC event, CEO Jensen Huang made some surprising announcements. Notably, he predicted that artificial general intelligence would be achievable within the next five years. Additionally, Nvidia unveiled a new AI platform called GR00T, designed for humanoid robots.

In a rather unexpected development, Google and Apple are reportedly in talks that could potentially lead to Google's AI model being deployed to power upcoming iOS updates. Whether this collaboration will be a temporary solution until Apple's own AI efforts catch up, a long-term partnership, or never comes to fruition remains to be seen.

Now, let's shift our focus to hacking and privacy concerns. The Biden administration is spearheading an international coalition to combat commercial spyware. Interestingly, some investors who are now part of this coalition were previously involved in the very business they are now fighting against.

In the gaming world, a recent hack caused an Apex Legends tournament to come to a halt. The hackers claimed that they did it for fun and to bring attention to the exploit used. This incident serves as a reminder of the importance of cybersecurity in the gaming community.

Glassdoor, the popular job review platform, is facing issues with user privacy. Some users have reported that their real names are being added to their profiles without consent. Unfortunately, the only solution provided to them is to delete their accounts entirely. It's crucial to double-check the anonymity of your profiles to avoid any unwanted disclosures.

Moving on to funding and IPO news, Reddit's IPO had a strong start. The stock price jumped 48% on its first day, closing at $46 after the market closed on Friday. This success showcases the growing popularity and potential of the platform.

Astera Labs, a company specializing in connectivity hardware for cloud computing data centers, saw a 72% increase in its stock price on its first day. With revenue growing by 45% to $115.8 million last year, Astera Labs is capitalizing on the AI boom.

In other funding news, The Browser Company raised $50 million at a valuation of $550 million. The startup, behind the Arc browser, has a unique approach to replacing PCs with browsers. Despite some controversy surrounding its strategy, the company continues to develop new features and AI updates.

To conclude, we have a bonus round for you. AI, while promising, still struggles with spelling. If you've ever come across an AI-generated image with terrible spelling, you're not alone. We delve into the reasons behind this phenomenon and the challenges AI faces in mastering spelling.

Additionally, Fisker, an EV manufacturer, has temporarily paused production due to financial constraints. Without additional capital, the company's operations may come to a halt.

Lastly, we explore the difficulties of reviewing AI systems like ChatGPT or Gemini. While it may be impossible to conduct a comprehensive review, it is still crucial to subject these systems to rigorous testing and evaluation.

That wraps up this edition of Week in Review. Stay tuned for more updates on the latest news and developments in the tech world.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/apple-antitrust-doj-splash.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-23 20:15:37,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/why-its-impossible-to-review-ais-and-why-techcrunch-is-doing-it-anyway/,"Why it's impossible to review AIs, and why TechCrunch is doing it anyway","Every week, new AI models are released, making it nearly impossible to comprehensively evaluate them. This poses a challenge when trying to review systems like ChatGPT or Gemini. However, it is important to attempt evaluations, and we continuously adapt our approach to do so.

The problem lies in the fact that AI models are numerous, broad, and opaque. The pace at which they are released is incredibly fast, making it difficult for anyone other than dedicated organizations to assess their merits and shortcomings. At TechCrunch, we receive news of new or updated models on a daily basis. While we take note of their characteristics, it is overwhelming to keep up with the influx of information, especially considering the complexities of release levels, access requirements, platforms, and code bases. It's like trying to tackle an insurmountable task.

Fortunately, our readers are primarily interested in top-line models and significant releases. Models like Vicuna-13B, although interesting to researchers and developers, are not commonly used for everyday purposes like ChatGPT or Gemini. Therefore, we can exclude these research models from consideration. However, even after eliminating many models, there are still more than anyone can handle.

The reason for this overwhelming number of models is that they are not simple software or hardware that can be easily tested and scored. Instead, they are platforms with multiple individual models and services integrated into them. For example, when you ask Gemini for directions to a good Thai restaurant nearby, it doesn't just rely on its training set to find the answer. Instead, it queries various other Google services and sub-models, creating the illusion of a single entity responding to your question. The chat interface is just a new way of interacting with a vast array of constantly changing services, both AI-powered and non-AI.

The Gemini, ChatGPT, or Claude we review today may not be the same version you use tomorrow or even at the same time. And because these companies are often secretive or dishonest, we don't have complete information about when and how changes are made. A review of Gemini Pro criticizing its performance on a specific task may become obsolete if Google silently updates a sub-model or implements secret tuning instructions that improve its performance on that task.

Now, imagine this complexity multiplied by thousands of tasks. These AI systems are capable of performing a wide range of tasks, even ones their creators did not anticipate or claim. Testing them exhaustively is fundamentally impossible because even millions of users using the systems every day do not cover the full extent of their capabilities or limitations. Developers constantly discover new functions and undesirable edge cases as these platforms are pushed to their limits.

Furthermore, these companies keep their internal training methods and databases as trade secrets. Transparency and external audits are crucial for mission-critical processes. For instance, we still don't have definitive answers on whether OpenAI used pirated books to train ChatGPT or why Google's image model produced a biased result. While these companies may offer evasive non-apology statements, they are unlikely to provide complete transparency.

However, this does not mean that AI models cannot be evaluated at all. Evaluations are possible but not straightforward. Think of an AI model as a baseball player. While they may have various skills like cooking, singing, or coding, what really matters is whether they can hit, field, and run. These are the essential skills in the game and can be easily quantified.

Similarly, AI models can do many things, but a significant portion of their capabilities are either parlor tricks or edge cases. Only a handful of tasks are the ones that millions of people are likely to use regularly. It is these tasks that we focus on, conducting evaluations to assess their performance. To do this, we have a team of experts who delve into the functions and capabilities of these models, testing their performance on real-world scenarios.

In conclusion, evaluating AI models is a challenging task due to the sheer number, complexity, and opacity of these systems. However, it is important to attempt evaluations to provide a real-world counterweight to industry hype. While comprehensive evaluations may be impossible, we focus on assessing the performance of models on tasks that are relevant and commonly used by people. By doing so, we aim to provide our readers with valuable insights and a qualitative analysis of these systems.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ai-robot-phrenology-v4.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-23 13:01:15,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/25/google-upgrade-samsung-s24-s23-pixel-towards-apple-iphone-15-pro-max/,Google Suddenly Reveals Surprise Android Update That Beats iPhone,"Android and iPhone are constantly competing to offer the best features to their users. Recently, Google has been making efforts to make Android more like iPhone. They have been working on enhancing Android security, adding WhatsApp calls to the phone dialer, and even including Apple passes in their wallet. However, with their latest update, Google not only matches an existing iPhone feature but goes even further, surpassing Apple in their own game.

In a previous report, I discussed Google's plan to introduce an emergency satellite service as a new feature. This feature will finally bring Android up to speed with the satellite SOS functionality that Apple has had for a few years. What's more, Google's offering seems to include a ready-made Garmin rescue service, which is a significant step forward for the safety and security of Android users.

One issue with Apple's emergency SOS feature is that it's only designed for emergencies. It puts an SOS tag on the screen when users are out of coverage, but it's a feature that most people never use unless they are climbing mountains or sailing oceans. However, with the latest Android 15 developer preview, Google is bridging the gap. They are opening the door for users to expand their cellular accounts to include a satellite add-on, allowing core messaging apps to use that satellite network. This means no more cellular black spots dropping users into a connectivity black hole.

According to Mishaal Rahman, Android 15 DP2 adds UI elements to ensure a consistent user experience for devices that support satellite connectivity. The update also expands platform support for satellite connectivity by introducing a new API that apps can use to detect when a device is connected to a satellite. Additionally, Android 15 allows SMS/MMS/RCS apps to use satellite connectivity for sending and receiving messages.

This last bit of information is the real news. Some networks already have plans to add low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite connectivity as an account option. Initially, we thought Google's update would include a ""Satellite SOS"" feature for Pixel phones. However, it seems that Android's satellite connectivity will go beyond emergency services. The potential is enormous, especially after Elon Musk announced that SpaceX achieved download speeds of 17mbps to an unmodified Galaxy S21 Ultra. This means that smartphones could make/receive calls and messages by connecting directly to a satellite, even without a cellular network nearby. Starlink has been testing such a service, and it may become available in the coming months.

While we wait for direct-to-phone satellite connectivity to become more normal and usable, the integration of satellite messaging is a great start. Android 15 is expected to include this feature, and it seems that Google is leading the way, with Apple likely to follow suit. This news comes shortly after reports that Gemini, a new AI technology, might be coming to iPhone. It has been an interesting week, with the gap between Android and iPhone closing even further.

Update: Exciting news about Google's plans for satellite messaging came just after reports that Gemini might be coming to Apple's iPhone. This development not only closes the gap between Android and iPhone but also enhances Google's role within the iPhone ecosystem.

This news is significant for several reasons. Firstly, it further demonstrates how Android is moving faster than iPhone. Gemini's deployment on Android handsets is progressing while Apple users are still waiting for clarity on what to expect in the next OS update. This highlights the ongoing competition between the two operating systems.

In conclusion, Google's latest update for Android, which includes satellite connectivity and messaging integration, is a game-changer. It not only matches Apple's existing features but also surpasses them. With Android 15 on the horizon, Android users can look forward to expanded connectivity options and improved messaging capabilities. As Android and iPhone continue to evolve, it will be interesting to see how Apple responds to these advancements.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65d79ec3dadcd6b682668331/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 00:06:15,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-deep-geothermal-renewable-powerhouse.html,Dig deep: US bets on geothermal to become renewable powerhouse,"Geothermal energy, a renewable energy source that harnesses heat from beneath the Earth's surface, is gaining attention as a potential backbone of the green transition. While it currently represents a small fraction of US energy production, both businesses and the Biden administration see the potential for technological advancements to propel geothermal energy forward.

Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm believes that geothermal energy has the potential to become a clean, reliable, and scalable power source for industries and households alike. In fact, her department estimates that geothermal energy could surpass hydroelectric and solar power in the US by 2050. However, in 2022, geothermal energy made up only 1.6% of US energy consumption.

To increase geothermal production, the US government has invested over $200 million since 2018 in an experimental site in Utah. This site focuses on Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), a technology that involves drilling exceptionally deep wells and injecting water into naturally hot rocks. Unlike traditional geothermal energy, EGS does not require a nearby hot spring or underground reservoir. This approach reduces the upfront risk associated with drilling and finding nothing, which has been a deterrent for some investors in the past.

Another advantage of geothermal energy is that the US government is allowing companies to convert permits for oil or gas exploration into geothermal licenses. This streamlined process reduces paperwork and delays. Additionally, geothermal drilling uses fewer chemical additives compared to classic fracking, making it more appealing to environmentalists. Unlike solar or wind power, geothermal energy provides a steady flow of energy regardless of weather conditions or time of day.

In terms of cost, the US government estimates that geothermal energy will become more affordable, dropping from the current range of $70 to $100 per megawatt hour to $45 by 2035. The use of existing drilling technology makes geothermal development quicker and cheaper.

While the US has been at the forefront of geothermal technology, other countries, such as France, also have experimental EGS sites. However, there is a potential risk of inducing seismic activity with geothermal drilling, similar to fracking. The US Energy Department requires all funded projects to follow a mitigation protocol to address induced seismicity and is actively funding research on the issue. So far, no community has reported feeling seismic activity near a DOE-funded project.

The growing interest in geothermal energy has led to the emergence of several start-ups in the US and Canada, which have raised significant investments. One notable example is Fervo Energy, which recently connected its Nevada site to the electric grid in collaboration with Google. As demand for geothermal energy grows, major companies like Google, Microsoft, and Nucor have also expressed interest in purchasing geothermal energy.

Despite the potential of geothermal energy, the sector is still in its early stages. The first successful commercial facility will play a crucial role in attracting further investment and driving industry growth. With proper planning and development, geothermal energy has the potential to become a significant player in the transition to a greener future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/a-worker-operates-a-dr.jpg,2024-03-25 04:59:03,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/24/samsung-s24-ultra-s23-free-update-warning-for-galaxy-android-users/,Samsung Issues Critical Update For Millions Of Galaxy Users,"Samsung Galaxy users, listen up! There's a critical update that you need to be aware of and install as soon as it becomes available. Trust me, you won't want to miss out on this one. Samsung has issued a warning that affects millions of users, so it's crucial to take action.

The March security rollout from Samsung is in full swing, starting with premium devices and now extending to more budget models. Just recently, carrier-unlocked S21 FE devices in the US joined the club. And over the past couple of weeks, various versions of S24s, S23s, and S22s received the update before older and budget-friendly variants followed suit. It's essential to ensure that your device downloads and installs the new software as soon as it's available for your specific network and model.

If you're unsure whether your device will receive the monthly update, you can check here to confirm.

Now, let's dive into the details of this update. Among the numerous fixes for Android and Samsung, there are a couple of high-risk vulnerabilities that have been patched. These vulnerabilities could potentially allow malware to take control of some or all of your device. So, it's crucial to stay on top of these updates to protect your device and data.

But the availability of the March update isn't the most significant news of the week. Samsung has finally decided to join Google's seamless update roadshow after years of avoiding it. Instead of going through the typical download, install, and reboot cycle for each update, Samsung's new system downloads and installs updates in the background to a secondary partition on the device. The device then reboots from that partition during the next restart, making it the primary partition, while the other partition awaits the next update. This process significantly reduces the downtime when your device can't be used normally, with most of it happening behind the scenes.

According to Google, this new system, known as A/B system updates or seamless updates, ensures that a functional booting system remains on the disk during an OTA (over-the-air) update. This reduces the chances of ending up with an inactive device after an update, which, in turn, leads to fewer device replacements and reflashes at repair and warranty centers.

You can identify if a seamless update is being installed by looking for two progress bars‚Äîone for the download/install and the other for verification. While the Galaxy A55 has been the guinea pig for Samsung's initial seamless update rollout, we can expect it to be implemented on many more devices in the coming months. We're all eagerly waiting to see which devices will be next in line.

However, it's uncertain whether this system will be extended to all Samsung models. Historically, Samsung updates have been known for their complexity, requiring users to consult checklists to determine what, when, and for how long an update is available.

So, what prompted Samsung to finally adopt the seamless update system? It's possible that they were pushed into it rather than willingly deciding to make the change. A comment from the Android Open Source Project hinted that the legacy alternative to seamless updates would be removed after running parallel to them for eight years. Considering that seamless updates have been available since 2016, Samsung's resistance has become legendary. On one hand, this has been a thorn in the side of the Android project, but on the other hand, Samsung's contribution to Android is undeniable. There have likely been numerous discussions behind the scenes regarding this update approach, but we're still in the dark about what the broader plan will be moving forward.

While this new system might shorten the update process to just a minute or two during which your device is temporarily unusable, it won't simplify the overall update process for Samsung/Android combination each month. Updates will still need to be deployed across the patchwork quilt of devices.

Nevertheless, this new system eliminates the need for user action. Since A/B updates occur in the background, they are no longer user-initiated. To avoid disrupting users, Google recommends scheduling updates during idle maintenance mode, such as overnight and while connected to Wi-Fi.

It's important to note that we're still a long way from Apple's streamlined update process. However, as iPhone and Android continue to grow more similar, perhaps we'll inch a little closer to that level of simplicity. Only time will tell.

In the meantime, make sure to stay vigilant and keep an eye out for the critical update for your Samsung Galaxy device. Don't delay in installing it once it becomes available. Your device's security and performance depend on it. Stay safe and enjoy the new features and improvements that come with each update.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65b9d23fb7b46f6467a28780/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2366,1280,x313,y135,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 22:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
