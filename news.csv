These services provide enterprise developers with access to Adobe's AI-powered features from its Creative Cloud tools, such as Photoshop, to streamline content creation or develop new solutions.

In addition to Firefly Services, Adobe has also introduced Custom Models, which allows businesses to customize Firefly models based on their own assets. This feature is already integrated into Adobe's new GenStudio.

Firefly Services is described by Adobe as a ""comprehensive set of generative AI and creative APIs that automate workflows."" It includes APIs for tasks such as removing backgrounds, cropping images intelligently, and automatically leveling the horizon in photos. Additionally, it provides access to core AI-driven features from Photoshop, such as Generative Fill and Expand. Firefly Services also offers tools for editing text layers, tagging content, and applying presets from Lightroom, among other features.

David Wadhwani, President of Digital Media Business at Adobe, emphasized the importance of customization capabilities and control in defining automation processes for brands. He stated, ""As consumer expectations around generative AI-driven personalization continue to rise, Firefly Services and Custom Models are first-of-its-kind offerings that unlock the possibility for brands to have powerful customization capabilities and more control in defining their automation processes.""

While these new tools aim to help brands accelerate their content creation workflows, many enterprises have concerns about brand safety when it comes to using generative AI. However, Adobe positions Firefly as a brand-safe alternative to other models, addressing these concerns and providing a solution that brands can confidently use in production.

Billy Seabrook, Global Chief Design Officer at IBM Consulting, highlighted the impact of Adobe's applications in the creative process. He explained, ""Adobe applications have been instrumental in our creative process, and now with Firefly, we can rapidly generate imagery and templates in a range of styles and sizes to align with brand standards and enable more people to participate in the creative process.""

With Firefly Services and Custom Models, Adobe aims to meet the growing demand for generative AI-driven personalization while ensuring brand safety and enabling brands to have greater control over their automation processes. These offerings provide powerful customization capabilities and automation tools that can transform content creation for enterprises.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-173424962.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-26 17:08:59,Innovation,Innovation
