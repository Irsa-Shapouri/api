https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/03/25/understanding-the-implications-of-the-sec-incident-disclosure-rules/,Understanding The Implications Of The SEC Incident Disclosure Rules,"In December 2023, the SEC implemented new rules regarding cybersecurity risk management and incident disclosure for publicly traded companies. These rules require companies to disclose any material cybersecurity incidents they experience within four business days via Form 8-K. Additionally, public companies must annually submit Form 10-K, which includes information about their processes for assessing, identifying, and managing cybersecurity threats. These rules aim to promote transparency and accountability in cyber risk management.

The SEC's focus is on whether companies are taking action to prevent or detect cyber incidents and mitigate their negative effects. They do not require companies to provide specific details about their cybersecurity strategies, as this information could be proprietary and potentially useful to malicious actors. Instead, the SEC asks companies to address issues such as their approach to assessing cyber risk, lessons learned from past incidents, and the expertise and experience of executives and board members in cybersecurity.

While the SEC states that the purpose of these rules is to inform investors rather than influence companies' cybersecurity practices, it is expected that the reporting requirements will lead to increased attention and informal measurement of cybersecurity across industries. Simply stating ""none"" in response to the cyber preparation questions may technically comply with the regulations, but it is unlikely to be well-received by investors, business partners, and customers.

As publicly available 10-K information becomes comparable, expectations for due diligence in corporate cybersecurity are likely to increase. While the level of cybersecurity measures may differ between small consumer product companies and major multinational corporations, the fundamentals remain the same for all. Companies should collaborate and practice their response to cyber incidents, developing a playbook that includes worst-case scenarios and more frequent but still significant incidents specific to their industry. Conducting tabletop discussions and testing the playbook can help senior executives and board members focus on the issue and make necessary improvements based on lessons learned.

In the event of a material cyber incident, it is crucial to involve both public and private sector partners in the response. Federal organizations like the SEC can provide guidance and expertise, while agencies like the FBI and CISA can offer assistance in assessing security posture and suggesting improvements. It is advisable to establish contact with these partners before a breach occurs, as their advice can help strengthen an organization's cyber resilience.

Private sector partners, such as digital forensics experts and specialized legal counsel, should also be considered for support during cyber incidents. Additionally, key suppliers, business partners, and customers should be included in incident response plans, as they may be affected by the incident and can provide valuable insights and assistance.

Overall, the new SEC rules aim to bring greater transparency and accountability to corporate cybersecurity efforts. By following best practices, collaborating with partners, and continuously improving cyber incident response plans, companies can enhance their cyber resilience and maintain the trust and confidence of stakeholders.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fdc7969c762b0830a28aba/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 09:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/03/25/unlocking-opportunities-strategies-for-private-tech-ceos-amid-economic-shifts/,Strategies For Private Tech CEOs Amid Economic Shifts,"As we enter 2024, CEOs and other leaders are faced with a rapidly changing business landscape characterized by economic shifts, uncertainty, and evolving market demands. While large public companies often dominate the headlines, private technology companies encounter their own unique challenges that require strategic acumen and a proactive approach from their leaders.

Private tech CEOs find themselves at a crossroads, navigating a landscape that demands finesse. While annual recurring revenue (ARR) and overall revenue growth have always been important, the focus has shifted towards building sustainable and profitable businesses, rather than pursuing growth at any cost. This shift is especially prominent in the tech industry.

The term of the times is ""efficient growth,"" which requires CEOs to address questions that focus on growing the top line while ensuring a sustainable bottom line. Executives, boards, and investors are seeking a delicate balance between strategic investment and prudent expense management, all while safeguarding the long-term health of their companies.

Another trend in the enterprise space is the preference for ""best of suite"" products over ""best of breed"" solutions. Cost-conscious buyers are increasingly gravitating towards comprehensive suites, leaving smaller private companies specializing in niche areas at a disadvantage. However, companies with unique products and solutions can differentiate themselves or partner with other niche players to offer bundled solutions for specific business problems.

Despite these challenges, opportunities are emerging for private companies that can strike the right balance between operational efficiency and revenue growth. Companies that can fortify their future through calculated investments in technology and talent acquisition will be well-positioned for the next growth cycle.

In 2024, CEOs need a clear strategy and the determination to stick to that strategy in order to navigate the complexities of the business landscape. It is crucial to remain focused on achievable and impactful priorities that align with the company's long-term objectives. Avoid getting distracted by small additional features or opportunities that may not have a significant impact on the business's success.

Establishing key metrics and milestones is essential for measuring success in 2024. By combining robust metrics such as ARR and net promoter score (NPS) with year-specific objectives and key results (OKRs), CEOs can align company goals with the metrics that drive success. This strategic approach ensures a comprehensive evaluation of the business's progress towards its overarching objectives.

Consistent communication is vital for success in 2024. CEOs must communicate the company's themes and objectives consistently and across all channels. From annual kickoffs to regular all-hands and small group meetings, as well as utilizing communication platforms like Slack, organizations can foster a shared understanding of the company's direction through clear, open, and consistent communication. Private companies have an advantage in this area, as they can often communicate long-term visions and short-term action plans in more specific detail without the scrutiny of external stakeholders.

Lastly, private company executives should take advantage of this time to listen and learn from the insights and experiences of others. Collaboration and knowledge-sharing can provide valuable insights that can help guide decision-making and drive success in the ever-evolving business landscape of 2024.

In conclusion, private tech CEOs must navigate a business landscape that demands finesse and strategic acumen. By focusing on achievable and impactful priorities, establishing key metrics, ensuring consistent communication, and leveraging insights from others, CEOs can position their companies for success in 2024 and beyond. It is through these proactive approaches that private companies can thrive in the face of economic shifts, uncertainty, and evolving market demands.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fdc4e335f0a794f4865496/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 08:30:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-deep-geothermal-renewable-powerhouse.html,Dig deep: US bets on geothermal to become renewable powerhouse,"Geothermal energy, despite its small contribution to the overall US energy production, is gaining attention as a potential key player in the green transition. The US government, along with various businesses and President Joe Biden's administration, is investing in technological advancements to make geothermal energy a reliable and scalable power source.

Jennifer Granholm, the Energy Secretary, highlighted the potential of geothermal energy at the CERAWeek conference in Houston. She stated that if we harness the heat beneath our feet, it can provide clean and dependable energy for industries and households alike. The Department of Energy predicts that geothermal energy could surpass hydroelectric and solar power in the US by 2050.

Currently, geothermal energy accounts for only 1.6 percent of US energy consumption in 2022. To increase production, the US government has invested over $200 million in an experimental site in Utah. This site focuses on Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), a technology that involves drilling deep wells and injecting water into hot rocks to generate geothermal energy. Unlike traditional geothermal methods, EGS does not rely on nearby hot springs or underground reservoirs.

Francesco d'Avack, an analyst with S&P Global Commodity Insights, stated that geothermal energy has the potential to be harnessed anywhere. It also reduces upfront risks associated with drilling, making it more attractive to investors. The US government is facilitating the transition to geothermal energy by allowing companies to convert permits for oil or gas exploration into geothermal licenses, reducing paperwork and delays.

Geothermal drilling offers several advantages over other energy sources. It requires fewer chemical additives compared to classic fracking, and it does not release hydrocarbons into the environment. Additionally, geothermal energy provides a consistent flow of power regardless of weather conditions or time of day.

Cost is another factor favoring geothermal energy. The US government estimates that the cost per megawatt hour (MWh) will decrease from the current range of $70 to $100 to $45 by 2035. The use of existing drilling technology makes geothermal energy development faster and more cost-effective. This innovative approach has positioned the US as a pioneer in geothermal technology.

While there are already EGS sites in other countries, such as France, they are considered experimental. One potential risk associated with geothermal drilling projects is the possibility of inducing seismic activity, similar to fracking. The US Energy Department requires all funded projects to follow a mitigation protocol to address induced seismicity and is funding research on the issue. So far, no community has reported feeling seismic activity near a DOE-funded project.

The growing interest in geothermal energy has attracted investment from various start-ups in the US and Canada. These companies have raised significant amounts of capital to further develop geothermal projects. Fervo Energy, for example, collaborated with Google to connect its Nevada site to the electric grid. While the site currently generates only 3.5 megawatts, it demonstrates the potential for geothermal energy to meet the needs of large consumers like Google, Microsoft, and Nucor, who have announced their intent to purchase geothermal energy.

Cindy Taff, CEO of Sage Geosystems, believes that the geothermal energy market is still open for new players. The industry needs its first successful commercial facility to pave the way for future growth. With the sector still in its early stages, the primary objective is to ensure responsible and sustainable development.

Geothermal energy holds great promise as a clean and reliable source of power. With ongoing advancements in technology and increasing investments, it has the potential to play a significant role in the transition to a greener future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/a-worker-operates-a-dr.jpg,2024-03-25 04:59:03,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/shirajeczmien/2024/03/25/why-a-us-tiktok-ban-is-a-terrible-idea-for-small-brands-and-creators/,Why A US TikTok Ban Is A Terrible Idea For Small Brands And Creators,"This month, the US Congress passed a significant bill that could potentially result in a nationwide ban of TikTok. The social media giant's parent company, ByteDance, would be forced to sell the app or face a complete shutdown. While this move would undoubtedly have an impact on various groups, it is the younger generation, Gen Z, that would be most affected. TikTok has become synonymous with this demographic, with 56% of Gen Z individuals considering it their top app. The average user between the ages of 12 and 27 spends nearly two hours on the platform daily. For this cohort, TikTok has become an all-encompassing app that offers entertainment, information, and even revenue opportunities.

However, the implications of a ban extend beyond reducing screen time for millions of young people. It has the potential to cause significant damage to the emerging creator economy and the thousands of small businesses that operate within it. The US government is well aware of TikTok's significance to Gen Z. Just last month, leaked plans revealed that political parties had allocated millions of dollars for micro-influencer campaigns, targeting the younger demographic with content tailored to niche audiences ahead of the upcoming November elections.

TikTok holds an unparalleled position for creators and businesses. Its powerful algorithm makes it easier to build a following compared to other social media platforms. The algorithm's success is built on four main pillars: user value, long-term user value, creator value, and platform value. Users have marveled at the algorithm's ability to understand their preferences better than they know themselves. TikTok quickly learns what users like and consistently serves up the most relevant and engaging content.

The app is confident in its algorithm's accuracy, primarily presenting content from creators that users don't follow. This approach has proven successful, as TikTok is the easiest platform for creators to gain a following. Once a creator reaches 10,000 followers, they can monetize their content through TikTok's Creator Fund. Additionally, there has been a rise in nano creators, those with a following of 1,000 to 10,000, who are landing brand deals before reaching the 10,000 milestone. In a time where 40% of American Gen Z individuals have a side hustle, having a source of income from remote work is highly valuable. TikTok offers better creator payouts compared to platforms like Instagram and YouTube. Of the career content creators making over $10,000 per year, 29% rely on TikTok as their primary income source, while only 7% cite Instagram.

However, earning money on TikTok extends beyond direct payments from the app. The real opportunity lies in brand sponsorships and affiliate programs. Through TikTok Shop, brands can collaborate with influencers, who become affiliates and earn a commission from any sales generated through their videos. This not only provides income for creators but has also proven to be an incredibly effective strategy for disrupting brands. For example, Made by Mitchell saw $2 million in sales within a week from TikTok, Little Moons experienced a 2000% increase in sales, and Lottie London attributes 30% of its revenue to the app.

Yet, the ban poses another significant problem. Big businesses that do not depend on TikTok for sales are often unable to effectively utilize the app. Many of these brands recycle content from Instagram or other platforms without adapting it to suit TikTok's unique editing style. This approach is obvious to the app's digital-native audience and ultimately drives them away. Moreover, big brands often over-script influencer sponsorships, disregarding the fact that influencers understand their audiences best.

If a ban were to occur, it would not be the big brands that suffer the most significant repercussions. Instead, it would be the high-growth disruptor businesses on the verge of achieving virality. These brands rely on the low-cost, high-impact advertising opportunities offered by TikTok. In fact, TikTok generates a 64% higher yield than alternative digital channels across Europe.

In conclusion, a ban on TikTok in the US would have far-reaching effects beyond reducing screen time for Gen Z users. It would severely impact the emerging creator economy and the many small businesses that depend on the platform. TikTok's algorithm and monetization opportunities have made it a vital source of income for creators, as well as a successful advertising platform for disruptor brands. While big brands may not be heavily affected by a ban, it is the smaller businesses that would face significant challenges. The ban's consequences highlight the unique and widespread influence that TikTok has established, making it more than just a ""dancing app.""","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66016ec5d35646492c3e5998/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1416,796,x0,y73,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 08:32:22,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/03/25/how-to-adopt-generative-ai-for-better-healthcare/,How To Adopt Generative AI For Better Healthcare,"The healthcare industry is rapidly embracing generative AI as a transformative technology. According to a recent study by Deloitte, 75% of top-tier healthcare organizations are actively exploring or planning to expand their use of AI. This technology has the potential to enhance operational efficiency and accelerate decision-making processes.

Not only are healthcare organizations recognizing the benefits of generative AI, but consumer sentiment is also positive. Another study by Deloitte revealed that 53% of respondents believe generative AI can improve healthcare accessibility, while 46% believe it can make healthcare more affordable. Furthermore, an impressive 71% of those surveyed believe that generative AI can revolutionize the healthcare industry.

The potential benefits of generative AI in healthcare are substantial, but its implementation requires a thoughtful and rigorous strategy. Healthcare providers should start by identifying and addressing specific challenges within their organizations. One effective approach is to begin with low-risk domains, such as automating routine tasks to allocate more time for patient care. As expertise in generative AI grows, its applications can expand to include advanced functions like clinical support.

Generative AI has already demonstrated remarkable capabilities in the healthcare industry. It can efficiently summarize complex medical texts, generate informative and coherent text, provide diagnostic and treatment insights, and even translate foreign languages. Additionally, its multimodal features allow it to transform textual descriptions into visual representations and analyze medical images using computer vision.

One of the most notable benefits of generative AI is its user-friendly interface. Unlike traditional technologies that require specialized programming knowledge, generative AI operates on the principles of natural language processing. This means healthcare professionals can interact with it using everyday language, making it accessible to a broader range of users without extensive technical training.

Implementing generative AI in healthcare requires a well-defined strategy. It's important not to overly focus on the technology itself. Instead, healthcare organizations should identify specific problems that generative AI can solve. Starting with lower-risk areas and automating mundane tasks, such as appointment scheduling and patient record management, can streamline administrative processes and reduce human error. However, it's crucial to ensure a seamless transition to human intervention when necessary to maintain the quality and empathy central to healthcare services.

Data management is another essential aspect of implementing generative AI effectively. Access to sizable and relevant datasets is critical for achieving optimal results. Healthcare organizations must establish the right infrastructure to manage and utilize this data efficiently, as it is often siloed or complex to navigate.

Customization of large language models (LLMs) or small language models (SLMs) is a sophisticated technical process that tailors generative AI to specific needs. This customization is vital for fine-tuning the AI to achieve the best results.

In conclusion, generative AI has the potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry. Its benefits range from enhancing operational efficiency to improving healthcare accessibility and affordability. By implementing generative AI with a well-thought-out strategy, healthcare organizations can address pressing concerns and provide better quality and more effective healthcare services.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6405efa13b66613f66c92092/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 09:15:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/dma-first-formal-probes/,"Apple, Google and Meta face first formal investigations under EU's DMA","The European Union has recently announced a series of investigations on Big Tech companies, and they have designated Alphabet/Google, Apple, and Meta as gatekeepers under the Digital Markets Act (DMA). These three companies will face the first formal non-compliance investigations under the EU's updated competition rules.

Alphabet/Google will be investigated for its rules on steering in Google Play and its approach to self-preferencing in search results. Similarly, Apple will be scrutinized for its rules on steering in the App Store and the design of choice screens for alternatives to its Safari web browser. As for Meta, the Commission will examine its ""pay or consent"" model.

The purpose of these investigations is to determine whether these gatekeepers are breaching the rulebook, as suspected by the Commission. If violations of the DMA are confirmed, fines of up to 10% of global annual turnover can be imposed, and repeat offenses can result in fines of up to 20%.

The EU will have a maximum of 12 months to conclude the investigations, with a preliminary report possibly being produced within six months.

These enforcement actions by the EU come at a time when antitrust scrutiny on these three US firms is increasing in their home country as well.

Since the announcement of their DMA compliance plans, there has been criticism that the proposals do not comply with the new EU law. For instance, Google has been accused of trying to bypass the regulation's ban on self-preferencing by introducing new rich features in search results that unfairly compete with rivals. Apple's use of notifications to warn users about risks outside its walled garden has been criticized by developers as ""scare screens."" Moreover, Meta's ""pay or be tracked"" tactic has been condemned by privacy and consumer rights groups as exploitative abuse.

The Commission has opened proceedings to assess whether Alphabet and Apple are breaching the DMA. Article 5(4) of the DMA requires gatekeepers to allow app developers to ""steer"" consumers to offers outside their app stores free of charge. The Commission expressed concerns that Alphabet and Apple's steering measures may not be fully compliant, pointing out various restrictions and limitations that hinder developers' ability to freely communicate, promote offers, and directly conclude contracts.

Regarding Google's self-preferencing, the EU will focus on Google's vertical search services, such as Google Shopping, Google Flights, and Google Hotels, and examine the impact these actions may have on similar rival services. The Commission is concerned that Alphabet's measures to comply with the DMA may not ensure fair and non-discriminatory treatment of third-party services featured on Google's search results page compared to Alphabet's own services, as required by Article 6(5) of the DMA.

In the case of Apple, the EU will investigate whether it is complying with various user choice obligations on iOS. This includes enabling end users to easily uninstall apps, change default settings, and select alternative default services, such as browsers or search engines, on their iPhones. The Commission is concerned that Apple's measures, including the design of the web browser choice screen, may prevent users from truly exercising their choice of services within the Apple ecosystem, contravening Article 6(3) of the DMA.

Regarding Meta, the EU will investigate whether its ""pay or consent"" model for EU users complies with Article 5(2) of the DMA, which requires gatekeepers to obtain consent from users when combining or cross-using their personal data across different core platform services. The Commission is concerned that Meta's binary choice approach may not provide a genuine alternative for users who do not consent, thereby failing to prevent the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers.

Margrethe Vestager, the Commission EVP in charge of competition policy, stated that they suspect the proposed solutions put forward by these three companies do not fully comply with the DMA. The Commission aims to investigate their compliance to ensure open and contestable digital markets in Europe.

The Digital Markets Act came into effect on March 7th, and the Commission has been in discussions with gatekeepers for months to help them adapt. While some changes have been observed in the market, the Commission is not convinced that the solutions proposed by Alphabet, Apple, and Meta are sufficient.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1031626648.jpg?resize=1200,799",2024-03-25 12:10:10,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenamcgregor/2024/03/25/your-employees-are-your-rd-lab-how-ai-changes-what-matters-at-work/,‘Your Employees Are Your R&D Lab’: How AI Changes What Matters At Work,"Borderless AI: Revolutionizing Global Hiring with AI

In the ever-evolving landscape of human resources (HR), AI is making its mark. With the emergence of Borderless AI, a startup that recently secured $27 million in seed funding, the future of global hiring is undergoing a transformation. Unlike typical AI assistance, Borderless AI offers an AI 'agent' to streamline the process of hiring workers in different countries. This innovative approach aims to make HR more efficient and effective by automating tasks such as completing employment contracts and onboarding documents.

Founded by Willson Cross and Sean Aggarwal, Borderless AI enters a competitive market known as ""employers of record,"" which facilitates global hiring through a network of local entities. However, what sets Borderless AI apart is its AI 'agent,' which goes beyond simple AI assistance. Instead of relying on HR leaders to use AI for quick queries, such as researching local parental leave laws or tax documents, Borderless AI takes it a step further by automating the completion of employment contracts and onboarding documents.

The startup has garnered attention with its recent funding round led by Susquehanna and Aglaé Ventures, the venture arm of billionaire Bernard Arnault. Additionally, Borderless AI has partnered with Cohere, a large language model, to enhance its capabilities. With such support and resources, Borderless AI has the potential to make a significant impact on the HR industry, much like the way Harvey has revolutionized the legal sector.

AI is transforming the field of HR and reshaping the way tasks are carried out. The promise of AI is to alleviate HR leaders from mundane tasks, allowing them to focus on more human-centric work, such as learning and development or fostering employee creativity. However, there is also concern that AI may eliminate HR jobs altogether. In his new book, Wharton professor Ethan Mollick explores the impact of AI on work and HR. He emphasizes the importance of learning and development as a defense against the changing landscape of apprenticeship. Mollick also highlights the value of employees as a company's research and development lab, underscoring the increasing significance of HR in the future.

In the realm of company culture, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) chief, Michael Whitaker, voiced criticism of Boeing's safety culture. In an interview with NBC, Whitaker expressed concerns that Boeing prioritizes production over safety. This criticism follows a culture survey of Boeing and an FAA audit into the company. Boeing has been under regulatory scrutiny since January due to an incident involving a Boeing 737 Max 9 door plug blowing out during an Alaska Airlines flight. These safety and quality issues have prompted Boeing CEO David Calhoun to announce his departure at the end of 2024, along with other executives stepping down.

The world of artificial intelligence (AI) also saw a significant shakeup with Mustafa Suleyman's departure from Inflection AI, the maker of chatbot Pi. Suleyman will be joining Microsoft as part of the new group called Microsoft AI. Inflection AI, on the other hand, will shift its focus to providing an application programming interface (API) to other businesses. This transition marks a major shift for the company, which previously focused on Pi as an alternative to OpenAI's ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude.

In the realm of human capital, Unilever recently announced its plans to cut thousands of jobs globally and spin off its ice cream business, which includes popular brands like Ben & Jerry's and Magnum. This move is part of a broader cost-saving strategy aimed at saving $868 million over the next three years. Unilever's CEO, Hein Schumacher, hopes that this restructuring plan will jumpstart growth for the conglomerate, which produces a wide range of products, including Hellmann's mayonnaise, Axe, Dove grooming products, and Domestos and Cif cleaning products.

In the education sector, President Joe Biden's administration made a significant announcement regarding student debt. The administration is canceling $6 billion in student debt for 78,000 public service workers, such as teachers, nurses, and firefighters. This move is part of the administration's ongoing efforts to alleviate the burden of student loans for Americans. Since taking office, the Biden administration has provided $144 billion in student loan forgiveness, benefiting nearly 4 million borrowers.

In conclusion, the emergence of Borderless AI presents a new frontier in global hiring. With its AI 'agent' and innovative approach, Borderless AI aims to revolutionize the HR industry. AI is reshaping the work of HR, allowing HR leaders to focus on more meaningful tasks. However, it is crucial to recognize the value of learning and development and the significant role HR will play in the future. As we navigate the changing landscape of work, it is important to embrace the potential of AI while also addressing concerns and ensuring a balance between automation and human-centric work.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660171a27597fcfde20fad48/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 09:18:10,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/spotify-courses-learning/,Spotify tests video courses to teach everything from music production to Excel,"Spotify, the popular music streaming platform, is expanding its offerings with the introduction of e-learning courses. In a move to engage its users further and increase their time and spending on the platform, Spotify is testing the waters with freemium video courses in the U.K. These courses, produced in collaboration with partners such as the BBC and Skillshare, will feature at least two free lessons, with the full course priced between £20 and £80. For now, the prices will be the same for both basic and premium users.

Mohit Jitani, the product director for Spotify's education business in London, explained that the pricing choices are being tested to understand the demand before considering a wider rollout. He stated, ""With this launch, we're trying to understand the demand first. Then we optimize how we can make it more compelling and exciting."" The courses will be accessible through Spotify's home and browse tabs, as well as on the web and mobile app.

The courses offered by Spotify fall somewhere between YouTube, Master Class, and LinkedIn Learning. They cover a wide range of subjects, including music production, Excel tutorials, and even lessons on creating online learning content. Unlike many other online learning platforms, Spotify's focus is on one-directional, on-demand video content. While some courses may include supplementary material, such as documents, there are currently no tests or interactive elements. Jitani did not comment on whether Spotify plans to introduce gamification or interaction in the future.

Spotify's first partners for the courses include Skillshare, PLAYvirtuoso, BBC Maestro, and Thinkific. The selection of courses will be curated based on users' listening and searching preferences on the platform. The topics covered by the courses are diverse, reflecting Spotify's aim to cater to a wide range of interests.

It is worth noting that the videos featured in the courses are owned by third-party publishers who license them to Spotify. However, the videos will be hosted and available for purchase on the Spotify platform. Revenue from course sales will be shared among the creators, publishers, and Spotify, with the content partners responsible for distributing payments to the creators. The specifics of the revenue share arrangement have not been disclosed.

Spotify's move into e-learning aligns with its strategy to diversify its business and improve its profitability and margins. Although primarily known for music streaming, Spotify's podcasting business has been growing steadily. The company has observed a strong correlation between popular podcasts and educational content on its platform. Around half of Spotify Premium subscribers have listened to education or self-help themed podcasts. Spotify aims to leverage this data and its recommendation algorithms to cross-promote courses and podcasts, ultimately boosting sales for both.

The decision to launch e-learning courses in the U.K. is driven by Spotify's recognition of the country's massive market potential and high user engagement.
