https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/26/ionobell-fundraise-exclusive/,Ionobell is turning to recycled silicon to boost EV range,"In the pursuit of maximizing the capacity of electric vehicle batteries, car manufacturers are increasingly turning to silicon as a solution. Silicon, a readily available but delicate ingredient, has the potential to increase battery capacity by at least 20%. Companies like Sila, Group14, Enovix, and Amprius are all vying to commercialize their silicon anode technology, capitalizing on the growing demand for extended EV range. Among these contenders is Ionobell, a seed-stage startup that claims to have a cheaper silicon material compared to its established competitors.

Ionobell's approach is similar to that of Sila and Group14. Both Sila and Group14 impregnate porous graphite structures with silicon, with Sila also adding a coating to the particles. Ionobell, on the other hand, takes a different approach. According to the company's patents, Ionobell starts with a porous silicon structure instead of graphite and surrounds it with a coating. This unique method prevents the silicon from swelling, allowing it to absorb lithium ions without compromising its structural integrity.

While silicon can accept ten times more lithium ions than graphite, its propensity to swell has limited its incorporation in battery technology. Ordinary silicon anodes can crumble with repeated use due to this swelling issue, which is why manufacturers typically use less than 10% silicon. However, the potential of silicon cannot be ignored, and researchers are continuously exploring ways to overcome its limitations.

One advantage of Ionobell's silicon supply is that it comes from a waste material, helping to reduce costs. According to Ionobell co-founder and CEO Robert Neivert, the majority of the cost savings come from the material itself, making it cheaper than graphite. Neivert initially encountered Ionobell as an investor but initially rejected them. However, after the team resolved the issues he had raised, including adapting their material to widely used manufacturing equipment, he became convinced of their potential and joined as CEO. Ionobell recently closed a $3.9 million seed extension round led by Dynamo Ventures and Trucks VC.

While Ionobell has made significant progress, it still faces challenges in the battery materials industry. The validation process required by automotive companies can be lengthy and demanding, and not every material makes it through. Additionally, competitors like Group14 and Sila are on the verge of commercializing their silicon-rich anodes, with their products expected to hit the market in the coming years.

Despite the challenges, the future of lithium-ion innovation is on the horizon, and silicon is leading the way. As car manufacturers strive to improve the capacity and performance of electric vehicle batteries, silicon's potential cannot be overlooked. With companies like Ionobell pushing the boundaries of silicon anode technology, we can expect exciting advancements in the EV industry in the near future.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/chuttersnap-xJLsHl0hIik-unsplash.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-26 14:30:29,Innovation,Innovation
