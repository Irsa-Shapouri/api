It Cut Air Pollution So We Can Breathe Easier.,"On red air days, when pollution levels rise to unhealthy levels, the metallic taste of polluted air lingers in your nose and lungs. It's a familiar experience for many, prompting individuals to stay indoors and avoid outdoor activities, especially vulnerable groups like the elderly, children, pregnant women, and those with respiratory issues.

The primary culprit behind toxic air in most places? Internal combustion engines powered by gas or diesel, emitting harmful pollutants into the air we breathe. With over two-thirds of Americans relying on personal vehicles for daily transportation, the transportation sector has become the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing significantly to climate change. Light-duty vehicles alone are responsible for nearly 60% of this pollution.

Addressing the pervasive air pollution problem necessitates cutting tailpipe emissions from our cars. The solution lies in implementing tailpipe emissions standards to make vehicles cleaner and reduce pollution. Recently, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency took a significant step by introducing new multi-pollutant rules for light-duty and smaller medium-duty vehicles. These regulations limit tailpipe pollution, promoting cleaner technologies and ensuring that new vehicles are more environmentally friendly than ever before.

The freedom to choose a clean car should be available to everyone, everywhere. Those concerned about reducing pollution should have the option to drive electric vehicles, contributing to cleaner air and a healthier environment for all.

Although the recent EPA standards represent progress towards cleaner air, some entities view them as a threat to their interests. Corporations profiting from vehicle sales and petroleum consumption argue that these standards impede consumer choice and freedom. However, the reality is that these updated regulations are long overdue and will benefit Americans by improving air quality and providing consumers with alternatives to costly fossil fuels.

Certain profit-driven corporate entities have launched campaigns to discredit the EPA's standards, spreading misinformation to the public. Their goal is to create a false narrative, suggesting that the regulations equate to a ban on gas vehicles. In truth, the EPA's standards are technology-neutral, performance-based, and grounded in scientific research.

The Clean Air Act, enacted in 1970, empowers the EPA to establish air quality standards to safeguard public health and regulate hazardous emissions. Over the years, the Act has driven significant advancements in emission control technologies, leading to a substantial reduction in pollutants from vehicles. Prior to the Act, cities like New York and Los Angeles grappled with severe air pollution, prompting the need for regulatory measures to protect public health.

The EPA's commitment to improving air quality and reducing emissions is essential for safeguarding public health and mitigating the impacts of pollution on our environment. By promoting cleaner technologies and setting stringent standards, we can create a healthier and more sustainable future for generations to come.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fe401fc35aefb76700b52e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 07:45:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/anuradhavaranasi/2024/03/24/which-adhd-medications-could-lower-risk-of-suicide--hospitalization/,Which ADHD Medications Could Lower Risk Of Suicide & Hospitalization?,"A recent study conducted by researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, has found that individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) who were prescribed ADHD stimulant medications had a lower risk of attempting suicide or dying by suicide. The study, which included 221,714 adults and adolescents with ADHD, also found that the use of ADHD medications was associated with fewer psychiatric hospitalizations.

The researchers, led by Heidi Taipale, focused on four ADHD medications: amphetamine, lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate. They found that these medications were linked to a decreased risk of hospitalization due to psychiatric co-morbidities. However, when it came to a decreased risk of suicidal behavior, only lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate showed an association.

The prevalence of psychiatric co-morbidity among individuals with ADHD was found to be 52%, compared to only 7% among those without ADHD, according to a previous study conducted in Sweden in 2019. Psychiatric co-morbidities include conditions such as major depressive disorder, panic disorder, substance abuse, generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, PTSD, and psychotic symptoms. The 2019 study also revealed that psychiatric co-morbidity increased the risk of mortality among individuals with ADHD, especially when it involved substance use disorder.

While atomoxetine, another ADHD medication, was not associated with a lower risk of psychiatric hospitalizations or suicidal behavior, the researchers did find a link between atomoxetine use and fewer hospitalizations for non-psychiatric co-morbidities.

The researchers noted that there is considerable evidence suggesting that ADHD medications, especially stimulants, improve functioning and quality of life in addition to addressing core ADHD symptoms. However, there is still limited knowledge regarding the long-term effectiveness and safety of these medications.

To investigate the association between specific ADHD medication use and the risk of psychiatric hospitalization, the researchers analyzed data from a nationwide cohort of adolescents and adults with ADHD in Sweden. The study included individuals between the ages of 16 and 65 who had received an ADHD diagnosis between 2006 and 2021. The researchers examined the participants' healthcare data from the Swedish National Patient Register, as well as data from the Prescribed Drug Register to determine which medications they were purchasing.

Methylphenidate was found to be the most commonly used ADHD medication, followed by lisdexamphetamine and atomoxetine. The study participants were followed for a period of 15 years. Among the 221,714 participants, 56% had a psychiatric co-morbidity, with anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and stress-related disorders being the most common. Approximately 26% of the participants had been hospitalized due to a psychiatric co-morbidity.

Interestingly, the study found that lisdexamphetamine was associated with a decreased risk of psychiatric hospitalizations among adolescents, young adults, and adults aged 30 and older. However, methylphenidate appeared to be less effective among older adults. The researchers suggested that this may be due to either the medication being less effective in older age groups or an initial effect that diminishes with longer-term use or the course of the illness. Atomoxetine, on the other hand, was linked to a decreased risk of hospitalization among women but not men.

The overall effect of ADHD medications on psychiatric outcomes was found to be beneficial, and the study also showed a decreased risk of non-psychiatric hospitalizations. However, the researchers highlighted concerns about the potential adverse effects of long-term stimulant use, such as increased blood pressure, heart rate, and the risk of cardiovascular diseases. There are also concerns about an increased risk of seizures, as well as the possibility of an increased risk of psychosis or mania.

The study, which was published online on JAMA Network Open on March 20, 2024, contributes to our understanding of the potential benefits and risks of ADHD medications in reducing the risk of suicidal behavior and psychiatric hospitalizations among individuals with ADHD. Further research is needed to explore the long-term effectiveness and safety of these medications.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/63c28dbb82c31b7412c92cf2/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 04:09:46,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikestubbs/2024/03/24/new-valorant-agent-clove-can-come-back-from-the-dead/,New ‘Valorant’ Agent Clove Can Come Back From The Dead,"Clove: The New Valorant Agent with Unique Abilities

Valorant fans were in for a treat at the recent Valorant Masters Madrid tournament when Riot Games introduced Clove, the 25th agent in the game. Clove brings a fresh set of abilities to the table, including a unique ultimate that allows them to come back from the dead.

As a controller, Clove focuses on disrupting enemies and providing utility for their team. However, what sets Clove apart is their ability to be a valuable and lethal agent, especially with their game-changing ultimate. Players can look forward to trying out Clove when they launch with the next Valorant patch on March 26.

One of Clove's abilities is Ruse, activated by pressing the E key. This ability allows players to deploy a smoke screen similar to Brimstone's, providing cover and blocking vision for enemies. What makes Ruse unique is that it can also be used while Clove is dead, adding an interesting tactical element to their gameplay.

Another ability in Clove's arsenal is Meddle, triggered by pressing the Q key. This grenade-like throwable inflicts decay on enemies hit by it, adding a layer of strategic play to engagements. While it may seem less impactful compared to other abilities, mastering Meddle can turn the tide of a battle in your favor.

Clove's C ability, Pick-Me-Up, is reminiscent of Reyna's kit. By eliminating an enemy, Clove can absorb their life essence to gain haste and a temporary health buff. This ability adds a survivability aspect to Clove's gameplay, rewarding aggressive plays and skilled eliminations.

However, the highlight of Clove's kit is their ultimate ability. When Clove dies with their ultimate ready, they can quickly activate it to come back to life for a short duration. Securing a kill or assisting in damage during this resurrection period will fully revive Clove, allowing them to continue the fight. This unique mechanic adds a layer of unpredictability and strategic depth to Clove's gameplay.

According to Dan Hardison, agent gameplay designer on Valorant, mastering Clove requires a bold and aggressive playstyle. Players must be willing to take risks and trade their own life for the greater good, removing enemy utility and securing victories for their team. Playing as Clove means embracing the chaos and being prepared to fight to the death, as their ability to contribute post-mortem can turn the tide of a match.

In conclusion, Clove offers a fresh and dynamic gameplay experience for Valorant players. With a focus on disruption, utility, and the ability to defy death, Clove is poised to become a favorite among fans looking for a high-risk, high-reward playstyle. Are you ready to embrace the fire and master Clove's unique abilities on the battlefield?",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff3fefa4d4cfc35a9fc1fe/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 11:15:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/marshallshepherd/2024/03/24/science-engagement-shapes-lives-and-changes-perceptions-too/,Science Engagement Shapes Lives And Changes Perceptions Too,"Science at Emory University. She is also a member of the East Suburban Atlanta Chapter of Jack and Jill of America, Inc. Dr. Dowe organized an event where I had the opportunity to speak to a group of kids about my career as an atmospheric scientist. It was a wonderful experience to engage with these vibrant students and share my journey with them.

As I stood in front of the group, I couldn't help but reflect on my own trajectory as a young Black boy interested in science. Growing up as the only child of a single mother, I spent a great deal of time exploring nature and monitoring the weather. I had a passion for insects and stream ecology, even though I didn't know the names for these fields at the time. However, a severe bee sting allergy changed my course, and I shifted my focus to weather. In fact, my sixth-grade science project was all about weather.

Although there were no scientists within my immediate circle of influence, I was well acquainted with the work of Dr. George Washington Carver. My mother, an alumna of Tuskegee Institute (now University), often spoke of him. I delved into books about him and marveled at the innovative things he did with peanuts. He became my first mentor, even though I never met him in person. His story inspired me to ask questions about the ""how's and why's"" of weather. I was more interested in understanding the science behind meteorology than in forecasting. Today, as a seasoned scientist with several National Academies honors, I am grateful for the opportunity to engage with young minds in person and share my knowledge.

Unfortunately, not many Black kids were pursuing careers in STEM when I was growing up, and this is still a sad reality today. According to a 2022 study by the Pew Center, positive perceptions about STEM within the Black American community are low. The study revealed that scientists and engineers were ranked lowest in terms of the highest levels of success, while professional athletes and musicians were ranked highest. This disparity is disheartening and underscores the need for greater representation of Black achievement in STEM.

The study also highlighted potential barriers to pursuing STEM education and careers. One factor is the lack of visible examples of Black achievement in science, technology, engineering, and math. This lack of representation can discourage young Black individuals from considering STEM as a viable path. Additionally, data from a 2023 blog on the Journal of Blacks in Higher Education website shows that Black students earn a smaller percentage of bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees compared to other racial groups.

Furthermore, the Pew study revealed that STEM fields often feel less welcoming for certain racial groups and women. As the former president of the American Meteorological Society, I have witnessed firsthand the lack of diversity within the field. Black membership in the AMS is only around 2%, which is a clear indication that there is work to be done to create a more inclusive and welcoming environment.

To strengthen the STEM ecosystem and promote inclusivity, we need to take a multi-faceted approach. First, we must increase visible examples of achievement from diverse groups. When young Black individuals see others who look like them succeeding in STEM, it can inspire them to pursue their own ambitions. Second, mentorship plays a crucial role in guiding and supporting aspiring scientists. By providing vigorous and sustained mentorship, we can help nurture the next generation of STEM professionals.

Additionally, we need to challenge cultural perceptions of what constitutes a successful career. Many times throughout my own journey, I was questioned about why I didn't pursue law, business, or become a ""real"" doctor. It is essential to establish the viability of STEM careers as equally respectable and fulfilling paths. Retention efforts are also vital in ensuring that students and professionals feel welcomed and supported throughout their journeys in STEM. By fostering an inclusive environment, we can encourage individuals to stay engaged and contribute their unique perspectives and ideas.

Ultimately, we must recognize that STEM research and development are enhanced when all ideas are on the table. Diversity of thought leads to innovation and breakthroughs. By embracing different perspectives and experiences, we can tackle complex challenges and make significant advancements in science and technology.

In conclusion, my recent experience speaking to a group of kids about my career as an atmospheric scientist was a reminder of the importance of scientific engagement and representation. As a young Black boy interested in science, I faced challenges, but the mentorship of individuals like Dr. George Washington Carver inspired me to pursue my passion. Today, I am committed to being a mentor myself and working towards a more inclusive STEM community. By increasing visibility, providing mentorship, challenging cultural perceptions, and fostering inclusivity, we can create a brighter future for aspiring scientists of all backgrounds.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660034c3235190ae18aa9cf0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 11:18:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have emerged as two powerhouse companies in their respective industries. While their core businesses were initially accidental discoveries, they have both experienced significant growth and success.

AWS realized that it could sell the internal services it had developed for itself, such as storage and compute, to external customers. On the other hand, Nvidia discovered that its GPU, originally created for gaming, was well-suited for processing AI workloads. These realizations paved the way for explosive revenue growth in recent years.

Nvidia's revenue has been growing at an astonishing rate, reaching $22.1 billion in Q4 2024 from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024. However, the majority of this growth came from the company's data center business. While AWS has not experienced the same level of intense growth, it has consistently been a major revenue driver for Amazon.

Both companies have had the advantage of being early players in their respective markets. As web apps and mobile technology emerged, the cloud became a valuable resource for enterprises looking to move their workloads to a more scalable and cost-effective environment. Similarly, the rise of AI and large language models coincided with the increased use of GPUs for processing these workloads.

AWS has grown into a highly profitable business, currently on track to generate close to $100 billion in revenue. However, its growth has started to slow down, while Nvidia's growth is accelerating. This can be attributed, in part, to the law of large numbers that affects companies as they reach a certain size. Nvidia's challenge lies in sustaining its growth and becoming a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS.

Although Nvidia does have other businesses, such as gaming and automotive, these are smaller revenue generators growing at a slower pace than the data center business. Therefore, Nvidia's ability to maintain its growth largely depends on the GPU market.

In the short term, Nvidia's revenue growth is expected to continue. The company anticipates $24 billion in revenue for its current quarter, a 234% increase compared to the same quarter last year. However, as Nvidia's revenue ramps up, its growth rate is projected to decline. Analysts expect the company to generate $110.5 billion in revenue for the current fiscal year, an 81% increase from the previous year but lower than the 126% gain in the previous fiscal year.

Despite the projected growth rate decline, Nvidia is still expected to scale its revenue past the $100 billion annual run rate mark. The company has immense potential for growth in the coming years, particularly in the AI sector. While competition from other chipmakers like AMD and Intel is on the horizon, Nvidia's market dominance gives it a strong advantage.

At the chip level, Nvidia maintains a firm control of the market. However, AMD is emerging as a stronger competitor at the board level. As the market evolves, Nvidia will face stiffer competition but is currently in a favorable position.

In conclusion, Nvidia and AWS have experienced remarkable growth and success in their respective industries. While AWS has been a consistent revenue driver for Amazon, Nvidia's revenue growth has been explosive, primarily driven by its data center business. Both companies have benefited from being early players in the cloud and AI markets. However, Nvidia's long-term growth potential depends on its ability to sustain its current trajectory and navigate the evolving chip market. With its market dominance and focus on AI, Nvidia is well-positioned for continued success in the coming years.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianmazique/2024/03/23/ufcs-dana-white-cuts-fighter-immediately-after-he-bit-an-opponent/,UFC’s Dana White Cuts Fighter Immediately After He Bit An Opponent,"Pressure and combat sports can push athletes to do unthinkable things. The most recent example of this occurred at UFC Fight Night: Ribas vs. Namajunas, where Igor Severino, in his UFC debut, resorted to biting his opponent, Andre Lima, during their preliminary bout. This shocking incident took place in the second round, while Severino had Lima in a standing grappling position.

The bite, which left visible marks on Lima's arm, resulted in Severino's disqualification. Images confirmed the bite, leaving no room for doubt. This act of savagery may have cost Severino his future in the UFC, as it will be difficult for him to regain the promotion's trust after such behavior.

Severino's loss to Lima was not only his first defeat but also a decisive one. With the disqualification, Severino's record fell to 9-1, while Lima remained undefeated at 8-0. UFC CEO Dana White wasted no time in cutting Severino from the roster, emphasizing the severity of his actions. ""Those were two up-and-coming undefeated fighters,"" White remarked. ""If you want out of the fight, there are plenty of ways to do it, but biting your opponent is the worst thing you can do. Now, you not only lose the biggest opportunity of your life but also face real problems with the NSAC.""

Biting incidents in combat sports are not unheard of, and they are equally reprehensible each time they occur. What sets this incident apart is Lima's remarkable composure in the face of such an attack. He calmly informed the referee about the bite, triggering a swift investigation into the violation.

For Severino, this disgraceful act will have consequences beyond the UFC. He will need to rebuild his reputation by competing in smaller promotions before even thinking about entering the UFC, the Professional Fighters League, or any other reputable mixed martial arts organization.

As the events of Saturday's fights in Las Vegas come to a close, stay tuned for more conventional results.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff92c285143669667fa59c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3188,1794,x0,y217,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-23 22:45:24,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/24/debunked-i-think-ive-seen-a-total-solar-eclipse-before/,Debunked: ‘I Think I’ve Seen A Total Solar Eclipse Before’,"If you believe you have witnessed a total solar eclipse, think again. This common misconception among eclipse enthusiasts is rarely accurate. As the anticipation builds for this rare celestial event, many mistakenly believe they have experienced the awe-inspiring phenomenon. However, in reality, what they have witnessed is a partial solar eclipse, a more common occurrence that happens twice a year across various parts of the world.

Why are so many people mistaken? The answer lies in the unforgettable nature of a total solar eclipse. If you have ever been among the select one in 10,000 individuals who have witnessed totality, you would know that it is an experience that leaves an indelible mark on your memory. It is not something you vaguely recall years later; it is an event you cherish for the rest of your life.

Moreover, witnessing a total solar eclipse requires significant effort. You must position yourself within the path of totality, the specific area on Earth where the moon completely obscures the sun. If you find yourself outside this path, you will only observe a partial solar eclipse. Therefore, if you claim to have seen a total solar eclipse without being in the path of totality, seasoned eclipse chasers will immediately doubt the authenticity of your experience.

That being said, many people in North America have indeed been fortunate enough to witness a total solar eclipse. The continent is currently experiencing a golden age of eclipses, with the most recent one being the highly anticipated ""Great American Eclipse"" in 2017. This spectacle of nature brought totality to 12 U.S. states, stretching from Oregon to South Carolina. Approximately 12 million people resided within the path of totality, while an additional million made the journey to witness this extraordinary event firsthand. If you were one of the fortunate individuals on that path, you would undoubtedly recall the breathtaking twilight-like sky, the moon's silhouette, and the mesmerizing sight of the sun's spiky white corona radiating in all directions. Such an experience would undoubtedly be etched in your memory as one of your most cherished moments.

For those who believe they may have seen a total solar eclipse during their school or work days, a few questions can quickly discern the truth. If the memory involves solar eclipse glasses or pinhole cameras, it is highly likely that it is from 2017 when North America experienced a partial solar eclipse. However, it is worth mentioning that there have been other solar eclipses on the continent within living memory. To eliminate any doubts, one can consult the Solar Eclipses Visibility Database, which provides information on eclipse locations and dates.

To further clarify the matter, here is a list of all the total solar eclipses that have occurred in North America over the past 70 years, as documented by GreatAmericanEclipse.com. If the specific event you recall is not among these dates, then what you witnessed was a partial solar eclipse. It is essential to differentiate between the two to understand the rarity and significance of experiencing totality.

So, the next time you encounter someone who believes they saw a total solar eclipse, inquire about the date, location, and their recollection of totality. After gathering this information, gently inform them about the upcoming once-in-a-lifetime total eclipse of the sun on April 8, 2024. This extraordinary event will provide an opportunity for them to finally experience totality and achieve something that very few humans ever have. It is estimated that an astounding 42 million people, including 32 million Americans, will be within the path of totality on this occasion.

On April 8, everyone in North America will witness a partial solar eclipse. However, only those within a narrow 115-mile path spanning parts of Mexico, 15 U.S. states, and Canada will have the privilege of experiencing totality. This path will traverse five states in Mexico, including Sinaloa, Nayarit, Durango, Coahuila, and Chihuahua. In the United States, it will pass through Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee (northwest corner), Michigan (southeast corner), Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. Additionally, six Canadian provinces, namely Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland, will be graced by this celestial phenomenon.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/omerawan/2024/03/24/children-in-gaza-are-starving-heres-how-starvation-can-affect-a-childs-health/,Here’s How Starvation And Malnutrition Can Affect A Child’s Health,"In Rafah, Gaza, a heartbreaking scene unfolds as Palestinian people, including children, reach out for food distributed by volunteers amidst ongoing Israeli attacks. The situation in Gaza has been described as ""catastrophic"" by the UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA) due to a severe shortage of food supplies. The toll of the Israel-Hamas conflict is devastating, with over 31,000 Palestinians killed, including at least 12,300 children since the war began in October last year.

While bombs claim lives, the lack of food is also a silent killer. Reports reveal that many Palestinians are succumbing to starvation, malnutrition, and dehydration as a result of dwindling food resources. Shockingly, at least 20 individuals, mostly children, have died from malnutrition and dehydration in Kamal Adwan and Shifa hospitals in the north. Malnutrition occurs when the body lacks essential nutrients, while starvation results from insufficient caloric intake, both leading to severe health consequences if left untreated.

The impact of inadequate nutrition on children is profound, affecting their growth, immune system, and cardiovascular health. Malnourished children are more vulnerable to infections and illnesses due to weakened immune defenses. Moreover, the lack of vital nutrients can impair heart function and lead to serious cardiac complications both in childhood and later in life. Studies have shown a link between early childhood starvation and increased risk of heart failure in adulthood, underscoring the long-term consequences of malnutrition.

Beyond the physical toll, starvation also takes a toll on cognitive and mental health, affecting attention, memory, and emotional well-being. Children experiencing starvation may struggle academically and face challenges in their future prospects and mental health. The psychological impact of malnutrition can manifest in anxiety, depression, and other mental health disorders, posing further risks to their well-being.

The plight of the children in Gaza is a humanitarian crisis that demands urgent attention and action. Innocent lives are at stake, caught in the crossfire of political conflicts beyond their control. It is imperative for the international community to unite in solidarity to end the suffering in Gaza and provide much-needed humanitarian aid. Both Jewish and Islamic teachings emphasize the value of saving a life as saving all of humanity, underscoring the moral imperative to act swiftly and decisively to protect these vulnerable children.

The time has come for collective action to save as many lives as possible in Gaza. Let us stand together to ensure that no more children perish from hunger and deprivation in a conflict they did not choose. It is a moral duty to extend a helping hand to those in desperate need and uphold the sanctity of life above all else.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65f72ef1f1dfd894d878d074/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 10:59:35,Innovation,Innovation
