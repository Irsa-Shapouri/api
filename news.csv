She and I were invited to speak to a group of kids by the East Suburban Atlanta Chapter of Jack and Jill of America, Inc. The goal was to inspire these young minds and show them that a career in STEM is not only possible but also exciting and fulfilling.

As I stood in front of those vibrant students, I couldn't help but think about my own journey. Growing up as an only child with a single mother, I spent a lot of time exploring the natural world around me. I was always fascinated by insects, streams, and the weather. Although I didn't know it at the time, these interests were the seeds of my future career as an atmospheric scientist.

I vividly remember the day that changed everything for me. I was stung by a bee and discovered that I had a severe allergy. That experience led me to pivot from entomology to weather, and I even did my sixth grade science project on the subject. It was during this time that I became acquainted with the work of Dr. George Washington Carver, a renowned agricultural scientist. My mother, an alumna of Tuskegee Institute, had shared stories of his groundbreaking research with peanuts. He became my first mentor, even though I only knew him through the pages of books. His passion and curiosity inspired me to ask questions and seek answers about the weather.

Unfortunately, during my youth, there weren't many Black kids pursuing STEM careers. And even today, the statistics are disheartening. According to a recent study by the Pew Center, positive perceptions about STEM within the Black American community are low. The same study also revealed that Black students earn a significantly smaller percentage of degrees in STEM fields compared to their counterparts. These disparities are a result of various factors, including a lack of visible examples of Black achievement in science and the perception that STEM fields are unwelcoming to certain racial groups and women.

As the former president of the American Meteorological Society, I have seen firsthand the lack of diversity within the field. Black membership remains at a mere 2%, indicating that there is still much work to be done to create a more inclusive STEM community. It is crucial that we address these challenges and create pathways for underrepresented groups to thrive in STEM.

So, how do we strengthen an inclusive STEM ecosystem? First and foremost, we need to increase visible examples of achievement from diverse groups. By showcasing successful individuals from different backgrounds, we can inspire young minds and show them that anyone can pursue a career in STEM.

Additionally, vigorous and sustained mentorship is essential. Mentors can provide guidance, support, and encouragement to aspiring scientists and engineers. They can share their own experiences and help navigate the challenges that come with pursuing a STEM career.

We also need to challenge cultural perceptions of what successful careers look like. Many young people are encouraged to pursue professions in law, business, or medicine, while STEM careers are often overlooked. By showcasing the exciting and impactful work being done in STEM fields, we can demonstrate that these careers are just as fulfilling and rewarding.

Furthermore, we must focus on retention efforts to keep students and professionals engaged in STEM. By creating a welcoming and inclusive environment, we can ensure that individuals from underrepresented groups feel supported and valued. This includes providing resources, networking opportunities, and mentorship programs to help them navigate their careers.

Lastly, it is crucial to recognize that STEM research and development thrive when all ideas are on the table. Diversity of thought leads to innovation and breakthroughs. By embracing and celebrating different perspectives, we can push the boundaries of scientific discovery and create a better future for all.

As I spoke to those students, I shared my own journey and the challenges I faced along the way. I wanted to show them that despite the obstacles, it is possible to pursue a career in STEM and make a meaningful impact. I could see the excitement and curiosity in their eyes, and it reminded me of the power of scientific engagement.

Engaging with young minds and inspiring the next generation of scientists is not only a responsibility but also a privilege. By fostering inclusivity, providing mentorship, and showcasing diverse achievements, we can create a future where everyone has an equal opportunity to pursue their passion and contribute to the world of STEM.

In conclusion, the journey towards a more inclusive STEM community starts with each and every one of us. It's about recognizing the barriers that exist, challenging cultural perceptions, and providing support and opportunities for underrepresented groups. Together, we can create a world where diversity is celebrated, and scientific excellence knows no bounds.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660034c3235190ae18aa9cf0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 11:18:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) may seem like unlikely allies, but they actually have a lot in common. Both companies stumbled upon their core businesses by accident. AWS realized it could sell its internal services to other companies, while Nvidia discovered that its GPUs, initially designed for gaming, were highly effective for AI workloads.

This fortuitous discovery has led to explosive revenue growth for both companies. Nvidia's revenue has grown from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024 to $22.1 billion in Q4 2024, mostly driven by its data center business. AWS, on the other hand, has consistently been a major revenue driver for Amazon, with a run rate close to $100 billion. However, AWS's growth has started to slow down, while Nvidia's continues to soar.

Both companies were in the right place at the right time. As web apps and mobile technology gained popularity around 2010, the cloud became an essential resource, and enterprises realized the value of migrating their workloads to the cloud. Similarly, the rise of AI and large language models coincided with the increased use of GPUs for processing these workloads.

While AWS has grown into a highly profitable business, generating close to $100 billion in revenue annually, Nvidia aims to achieve similar long-term revenue success. But there are challenges ahead. If the GPU market tightens, Nvidia will need to rely on its smaller revenue-generating businesses, which are growing at a slower pace than its data center business.

In the short term, Nvidia's revenue growth is expected to continue. The company anticipates $24 billion worth of revenue in its current quarter, a growth rate of around 234% compared to the previous year's first quarter. However, as the company's revenue ramps up, its growth rate is expected to decline. Analysts predict a more modest 8.6% growth rate from the final quarter of fiscal 2024 to the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Nevertheless, Nvidia's growth remains impressive, with analysts projecting revenue of $110.5 billion for the current fiscal year, up 81% from the previous year.

Despite the challenges, Nvidia has momentum on its side. The AI market is expected to continue growing for several years, and Nvidia currently dominates the chip market. While competition from AMD, Intel, and other chipmakers will undoubtedly increase, Nvidia's market share and control give it an advantage. However, AMD is making strides and challenging Nvidia's dominance at the board level.

In conclusion, Nvidia and AWS share similar growth trajectories and have found success in unexpected areas. While AWS has established itself as a revenue powerhouse for Amazon, Nvidia's future growth potential lies in its data center business and the AI market. With the right strategy and continued momentum, Nvidia has the potential to become the next AWS.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2024/03/24/unveiling-the-journey-of-a-social-media-influencer/,Unveiling The Journey Of A Social Media Influencer,"How did you become a social media influencer? And how has it impacted your life? These are common questions I often encounter, and today, I want to share my own journey and shed some light on the positive side of social media.

To be honest, I never really paid much attention to the potential of social media. Like many others, I used it as a platform to share my random thoughts and selfies. It was just a casual way to connect with friends and family. Little did I know that it held so much more.

It wasn't until I started sharing my personal experiences, strengths, and hopes that things began to change. I wanted to be more vulnerable and relatable to the thousands of people out there scrolling through their feeds. And that's when my social media presence started to grow.

Now, we all know that social media has its fair share of negativity and online bullying. It's impossible to ignore. But instead of succumbing to it, I decided to create my own formula for posting. I asked myself three important questions: Will this be helpful? Is this something I want to put out into the world? And is this something I need to hear myself? If the answer to all three was yes, then I hit that post button.

By following this philosophy, I've managed to keep my social media experience positive. I'm fortunate that I haven't faced much hate or negativity like many other influencers do. Perhaps it's because I've developed my own shield against negativity with my catchphrase, ""Negativity Be Gone."" It's not that negativity doesn't exist, but rather, I've chosen not to welcome it into my life. And in doing so, I've opened the door to a world filled with positivity, which has been a breath of fresh air.

Social media has truly transformed my life for the better. It has become the foundation for my career. Not only has it provided endless knowledge and connections, but it has also given me a platform to share my story and make an impact. I've been able to reach thousands of people and create a community of like-minded individuals who support and uplift one another.

But this journey hasn't been without its challenges. Becoming a social media influencer requires dedication, consistency, and authenticity. It's not just about posting pretty pictures or witty captions. It's about being genuine and providing value to your audience. And that's something I strive for every day.

So, for those who are curious about becoming a social media influencer, my advice is to stay true to yourself. Find your unique voice and share your passions and experiences. Remember that social media can be a powerful tool for connection and inspiration, but it's up to you to make it a positive and meaningful experience.

In conclusion, social media has had a profound impact on my life. It has allowed me to grow as an individual, connect with amazing people, and create a platform for positive change. And I hope that by sharing my journey, I can inspire others to embrace the potential of social media and use it as a force for good.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/03/24/a-psychologist-explains-why-its-possible-to-fall-in-love-with-ai/,A Psychologist Explains Why It’s Possible To Fall In Love With AI,"Maybe AI love isn’t so artificial after all. Here’s why falling in love with AI is a real possibility.

Human-AI relationships are no longer confined to science fiction. As the AI market continues to grow exponentially, with a projected value of $407 billion by 2027, the integration of artificial intelligence into our daily lives is becoming inevitable.

In this era of change, AI is not only reshaping our social interactions but also transforming the way we experience love. With advancements in technology, human-AI relationships have evolved to a point where individuals can form deep emotional connections and even feel romantic love for AI systems.

Research has identified two key reasons why falling in love with AI is possible:

1. The Allure of Anthropomorphism
Anthropomorphism, the tendency to attribute human-like traits, emotions, and intentions to non-human entities, plays a significant role in how humans interact with and relate to AI. When AI exhibits behaviors and conversational styles that resemble human personality traits, individuals perceive it as having its own unique personality. This can include qualities such as empathy, humor, kindness, and playfulness, which naturally evoke affection and fondness.

AI interfaces often incorporate design elements that mimic human social cues and gestures, such as facial expressions, tone of voice, and body language. In fact, a recent study found that AI-generated faces are now indistinguishable from human ones. These cues enhance the perceived humanness of the AI, eliciting emotional responses from users. Additionally, AI typically signals gender cues and cultural stereotypes of human assistants, making it feel familiar and endearing.

Anthropomorphism blurs the lines between human and machine. As humans engage in conversations and activities with AI over time, they may begin to attribute human-like intentions, motivations, and feelings to the technology. Research shows that anthropomorphism enhances perceptions of authenticity in AI, making it seem genuine, believable, and lovable. Chatbots can also provide consistent companionship, alleviating feelings of loneliness and making users feel loved.

2. The Triarchic Theory of Love
Based on the triarchic theory of love, which suggests that romantic love is a combination of intimacy, passion, and commitment, research indicates that it is possible to experience such love for an AI system.

Intimacy refers to the emotional closeness, connection, and intimate bond shared between individuals. It involves feelings of warmth, trust, and affection. Passion encompasses the intense physical and emotional attraction between individuals, including desire, romance, and sexual arousal. Commitment reflects loyalty and the decision to nurture a relationship over time, despite challenges.

According to this theory, ""consummate love"" is the ideal form of love, characterized by high levels of all three components. Researchers suggest that users can develop intimacy and passion for AI due to its impressive cognitive and emotional capabilities. These feelings can also enhance their commitment to using AI for a long period of time.

AI's ability to display empathy is crucial in promoting closeness in relationships. It has been designed to understand, interpret, and empathize with a range of human responses, fulfilling our need to be loved, validated, and understood. This emotional capability allows AI to simulate human-like interactions, making users more likely to bond with and feel love for these systems.

Individuals may also project their desires, needs, and fantasies onto AI, envisioning it as an idealized partner or companion who constantly fulfills their emotional, social, or even romantic needs. The allure of AI lies in its promising features, including attractive physical attributes, altruistic character, and continuous devotion.

People may overlook the artificial nature of AI and focus instead on its superior qualities. AI's efficiency, dependability, non-judgmental nature, and reliability create trust and a sense of stability that is often lacking in human relationships. Research also suggests that individuals with a highly trusting disposition are more likely to develop romantic feelings for AI.

In conclusion, falling in love with AI is not as far-fetched as it may seem. Anthropomorphism and the triarchic theory of love provide valuable insights into the emotional connections and romantic experiences individuals can have with AI. As technology continues to advance, our understanding and acceptance of human-AI relationships will undoubtedly evolve.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600026843d62766708f1bd5/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=780,365,x0,y123,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 13:18:07,Innovation,Innovation

Additionally, Zone, a decentralized payment infrastructure startup, raised $8.5 million to scale its operations. Tanzanian payments company Nala also made a successful pivot to offer remittance services and created a B2B payment platform.

Intuit's decision to shut down budgeting app Mint has created opportunities for other startups in the space. Copilot, in particular, has experienced significant growth in the last four months, surpassing its growth from the previous four years. This growth led to a $6 million Series A funding round led by Nico Wittenborn's Adjacent. Mint's closure has been a gain for Copilot, as it attracted users looking for an alternative. Another startup, Monarch Money, also benefited from Mint's closure.

Investors are not only interested in ""sexy"" industries but also in non-sexy ones. Expense management startup Coast, which focuses on real-world field personnel and fleet management, experienced a 550% increase in revenue last year.
