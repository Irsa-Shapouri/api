https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/26/ember-is-building-an-all-electric-intercity-bus-network-in-the-uk/,How Ember is building an all-electric intercity bus network in the UK,"A Scottish company has recently secured $14 million in funding to expand its all-electric intercity bus network across the UK. Ember, founded in Edinburgh in 2019, started with just one bus and has since grown to operate 24 buses, with plans to add more. The company began by purchasing a bus from China's Yutong and its UK distributor Pelican, and has now received 14 new vehicles with improved battery capacity and charging speed. Ember has taken a ""full-stack"" approach to its fleet development, managing everything from manufacturing and charging infrastructure to customer service and software. The buses are powered by cobalt-free lithium-iron-phosphate batteries and feature amenities such as 5G Wi-Fi, USB charging ports, and increased passenger and luggage capacity. Ember currently has a main charging hub in Dundee and plans to add more charging capacity across additional sites in Scotland. While the CCS EV charging system used by Ember is a common standard, the company's intensive day-to-day usage limits spare capacity for sharing access with third parties. However, Ember does envision enabling this in certain locations as the network expands. With its recent funding, Ember is well-positioned to continue its expansion and contribute to the growth of electric transport in the UK.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Ember-Keith-and-Pierce-e1711126322528.jpeg?resize=1200,676",2024-03-26 07:00:11,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/can-you-hear-me-now-ai-coustics-to-fight-noisy-audio-with-generative-ai/,Can you hear me now? AI-coustics to fight noisy audio with generative AI,"Can you hear me now? AI-coustics to fight noisy audio with generative AI

Noisy recordings of interviews and speeches can be a headache for audio engineers. But a German startup called AI-coustics aims to solve this problem using generative AI to enhance the clarity of voices in videos. Recently, AI-coustics emerged from stealth with €1.9 million in funding. The company's technology goes beyond standard noise suppression and works across any device and speaker.

Fabian Seipel, co-founder and CEO of AI-coustics, explained that their core mission is to make every digital interaction, whether on a conference call, consumer device, or casual social media video, as clear as a broadcast from a professional studio. Seipel, an audio engineer by training, founded AI-coustics with Corvin Jaedicke, a machine learning lecturer at the Technical University of Berlin, in 2021. They both experienced poor audio quality in online courses and tutorials during their time at TU Berlin, which led them to work on improving speech quality and intelligibility.

The market for AI-powered noise-suppressing and voice-enhancing software is already robust. AI-coustics' competitors include Insoundz, which uses generative AI to enhance streamed and pre-recorded speech clips, and Veed.io, a video editing suite with tools to remove background noise from clips. However, AI-coustics has a unique approach to developing the AI mechanisms for noise reduction.

The startup uses a model trained on speech samples recorded in their studio in Berlin. People are paid to record samples, which are then added to the data set used to train AI-coustics' noise-reducing model. Seipel mentioned that they have developed a unique approach to simulate audio artifacts and problems, such as noise, reverberation, compression, band-limited microphones, distortion, and clipping, during the training process.

While AI-coustics' compensation scheme for creators has raised some concerns, the company is focusing on recruiting diverse speech sample contributors to combat bias. Seipel emphasized the importance of size and diversity in eliminating bias and making the technology work for all languages, speaker identities, ages, accents, and genders.

To test AI-coustics' performance, three video clips were uploaded to their platform: an interview with an 18th-century farmer, a car driving demo, and an Israel-Palestine conflict protest. AI-coustics delivered on its promise of boosting clarity, reducing ambient background noise that drowned out speakers.

Seipel envisions AI-coustics' technology being used for real-time as well as recorded speech enhancement, and potentially being embedded in devices like soundbars, smartphones, and headphones to automatically improve voice clarity. Currently, AI-coustics offers a web app and API for post-processing audio and video recordings, as well as an SDK for integrating their platform into existing workflows, apps, and hardware.

AI-coustics has five enterprise customers and 20,000 users, with a mix of subscriptions, on-demand pricing, and licensing as their revenue model. The company plans to expand its team and improve the underlying speech-enhancing model in the coming months.

With AI-coustics' innovative approach to noise reduction and voice enhancement, the future of audio quality in digital communications looks promising. The use of generative AI to improve clarity and eliminate background noise could revolutionize the way we experience audio in various settings. Whether it's a conference call, a social media video, or an online course, AI-coustics aims to make every digital interaction crystal clear.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1009979808.jpg?resize=1200,801",2024-03-25 18:43:01,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/espn-adding-local-sports-to-its-app-and-website-is-your-team-there-yet/,ESPN adding local sports to its app and website - is your team there yet?,"ESPN is taking steps to make its streaming offerings more comprehensive in the face of a growing fragmented market. In the coming months, sports fans will be able to access broadcasts from several regional sports networks (RSNs) directly from the ESPN app and website.

Starting this week, subscribers to NESN, which covers Boston-area sports teams, can watch live games from the Red Sox, Celtics, Patriots, and Bruins directly from the ESPN site or app. Monumental Sports Network, which covers the Washington D.C.-area Capitals, Wizards, and Mystics, will be added next month. SportsNet Pittsburgh, which broadcasts Penguins, Pirates, and WVU games, will also be available. More RSNs are expected to follow.

In recent years, many sports franchises have signed agreements to have their games broadcast on regional sports networks. These networks, which typically cover multiple teams from a city or region, can be part of a cable package or standalone, but usually require an additional subscription.

Although users will still need to pay for a subscription to these specific networks to watch the games, ESPN's partnership makes it much easier to find them. The actual streams will still come from the provider websites, and the content will also be available in RSN apps.

For the regional networks, this increased discoverability is significant. When a game is easier to find and a link to it is available in an app they already have, customers are more likely to subscribe. Additionally, teams want their games to be accessible to as many people as possible, so this partnership benefits all parties involved. There will be no additional charges, only a simpler process for fans to find and watch games.

ESPN has ensured that these links will only be displayed to individuals residing in the coverage areas of the respective networks. This means that users will not see the option to watch games they do not have access to.

This move by ESPN comes after the company's recent announcement of a streaming service partnership with Fox and Warner Bros. This collaboration will cover nearly every major and minor sports league, providing fans with MLB, NFL, NBA, NHL, NCAA football and basketball, NASCAR, PGA Tour, Grand Slam tennis, soccer, and more all in one app. With these three industry rivals combined, fans will have a comprehensive and convenient streaming solution for their favorite sports.

In a world where streaming options are becoming increasingly fragmented, ESPN's efforts to bring various regional sports networks under one platform is a welcome development for sports enthusiasts. With the convenience of finding and accessing live games from different networks in a single app, fans can enjoy their favorite teams and sports without the hassle of multiple subscriptions and platforms.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/83df13de495fcfec3cffb77378df0e2ad3591ce2/2024/03/25/fd31c575-1031-497a-845f-afbf4b97b11c/pxl-20240325-185459546.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/900care-raises-23-million-for-its-waterless-personal-care-products/,900.care sells waterless personal care products and lets you add tap water at home,"The personal care industry is filled with products that are mostly composed of water and packaged in plastic bottles. But French startup 900.care is taking a different approach. Instead of selling pre-mixed products in plastic bottles, they focus on the active ingredients that make these products effective.

When you make your first purchase from 900.care, you receive an empty, reusable plastic bottle with a pump. Inside the bottle, you place a compacted powder stick and add water. After a few hours, the product is ready to use. When you need more shower gel or shampoo, all you need is a new stick and some tap water. This way, you can enjoy the benefits of using personal care products without contributing to plastic waste.

The concept has been well received in France, and 900.care recently raised €21 million in funding. The company follows a direct-to-consumer model, allowing customers to purchase products exclusively from their website. They also offer subscription options, as personal care products are something people consistently need.

In 2023, 900.care generated €10 million in revenue, with 90,000 clients and 235,000 active subscriptions. In addition to shower gel and shampoo, they also sell foaming hand soap, dish soap, laundry and dishwasher tablets, among other products. By using their products, the company estimates that they have prevented the equivalent of 3.5 million plastic bottles from becoming waste.

Not only do 900.care's products benefit the environment, but they also have practical advantages. The compacted powder sticks can be easily shipped in regular envelopes, reducing shipping costs. The production process is also streamlined, as factories no longer need large basins to mix water with active ingredients. Instead, they simply mix and compact different powders to create the sticks.

To meet their specific needs, 900.care opened a dedicated factory in Saint-Etienne in 2023. This factory, operated by a partner, is designed exclusively for the production of compacted powder sticks. The specialized facility has improved the company's profit margins and allowed them to scale their operations.

Looking ahead, 900.care has ambitious goals. They plan to expand beyond France, Belgium, and Switzerland to other European countries. With this expansion, they aim to reach €100 million in revenue within three years. Despite their growth plans, the company still expects to turn a profit this year.

In a market dominated by water-filled products in plastic bottles, 900.care offers a refreshing alternative. By focusing on the active ingredients and reducing plastic waste, they have found success in the personal care industry. With their innovative approach and commitment to sustainability, 900.care is poised to make a lasting impact on the market.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mousse-Mains-1.jpg?resize=1200,690",2024-03-26 05:00:00,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/25/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-upgrade-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-s23/,Apple’s Surprise Update Just Made iPhone More Like Android,"Apple’s AI news has taken the tech world by surprise, and the latest rumor is even more shocking. It has been confirmed that Apple is discussing a generative AI deal with China's Baidu. This means that Chinese generative AI will be coming to the iPhone, specifically in China.

This news is significant because Apple has always prided itself on being more private and secure than Android. However, as Google strengthens its security and privacy measures, the differences between the two tech giants are diminishing. Apple is now making concessions of its own.

Baidu's AI model is approved by the Chinese government, and the company has strong links to the state. Although there were reports suggesting military AI ties, they were denied. Nonetheless, this partnership between Apple and Baidu raises interesting questions about privacy, considering Apple's focus on privacy and security.

In China, the AI landscape is highly regulated, with only government-approved models allowed. While the primary focus of these approvals is censorship and preventing dissent, surveillance, monitoring, and control are always underlying factors. Apple has been navigating these challenges since its early days in China, and its growth in the country has only intensified the situation.

AI presents a difficult path for Apple to tread because of its potential to rapidly expand its role in our smartphones and lives. Granting or denying AI access to sensitive information will be an ongoing challenge. Baidu, like other Chinese tech companies, is subject to national security laws, which have been heavily debated in relation to companies like ByteDance/TikTok and Huawei.

Initially, it was speculated that Apple's generative AI plans for iOS 18 would be on-device, with Apple designing hardware and software to ensure privacy and security extended to the AI realm. This would have been a logical extension of Apple's end-to-end encryption and user controls. However, news emerged that Apple was in talks with Google about using its Gemini technology, which changed everything.

From a privacy standpoint, Google's AI is primarily cloud-based, although it does have some on-device functionality. The idea that Apple was considering using Google's technology surprised many, given the companies' different approaches to AI, cloud, encryption, and privacy. However, there is a commercial logic to this alliance. Google is leading the way in generative AI and has paved the way for this deal with its exclusive iPhone search arrangement.

This alignment between iPhone and Android reflects a growing trend of closer collaboration. Samsung, for example, has a similar approach, combining on-device and cloud-based AI. This allows users to have greater control over their data and limit certain features to function solely on-device. Samsung's TM Roh emphasized the need to raise the standards of security and privacy in the era of data-intensive mobile experiences.

Interestingly, Apple now seems to be contemplating a similar hybrid approach for the iPhone. This means that some AI features could be on-device, while others rely on cloud-based AI. This approach balances AI capabilities with user privacy and data security.

It is worth noting that Apple's position is unexpected, especially considering the optics of incorporating Chinese generative AI. Apple has always been known for its strict privacy measures, and the inclusion of Baidu's AI adds another layer of complexity to the situation.

In light of these developments, it is clear that Apple is at a crossroads when it comes to AI. It must navigate the challenges of balancing user privacy, security, and the potential of AI while staying true to its principles. The partnership with Baidu and the potential use of Google's technology demonstrate the changing landscape and the need for Apple to adapt.

As Apple continues to explore the possibilities of AI, it will be interesting to see how it approaches the delicate balance between privacy, security, and innovation. The tech world is eagerly awaiting Apple's next move and how it will shape the future of AI on the iPhone.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65aeed369be3a016e61b4a9a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 23:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/lesliekatz/2024/03/25/artists-get-early-access-to-openais-sora-video-tool-with-surreal-results/,OpenAI Gave Artists Early Access To Sora. See The Videos They Created,"""Air Head"" is a captivating short film created using OpenAI's Sora text-to-video tool. This innovative tool has allowed artists, designers, and filmmakers to explore their creativity and produce surreal and imaginative content. Shy Kids, a multimedia production company based in Toronto, created Air Head with Sora and expressed their excitement about the tool's ability to generate both realistic and surreal visuals.

The short film revolves around a character with a yellow balloon for a head. He humorously states, ""I am literally filled with hot air,"" as he shares his experiences and challenges of living with this anatomical anomaly. Windy days cause his head to blow off, and walking through a cactus aisle in a plant store can be prickly. However, he also appreciates the fragility of his situation, acknowledging that we are all just one pin prick away from deflation.

Sora, which OpenAI introduced to the public in February, is a generative AI tool capable of producing videos up to a minute long based on a single text prompt. Although Sora is not yet available as a product, OpenAI is actively working to evaluate its capabilities, limitations, and potential risks. The short film created by Shy Kids and other early testers, including Alexander Reben, OpenAI's first artist in residence, will provide valuable insights to the company as they continue to refine the tool.

Generative AI has sparked various reactions, ranging from excitement about its creative potential to concerns about intellectual property theft and job displacement for artists. The artists and filmmakers who had early access to Sora predominantly display enthusiasm for the tool. Josephine Miller, the creative director of London-based Oraar Studio, praises Sora for challenging her creative process and helping her evolve in storytelling. Her film showcases a dreamy subaquatic world where individuals gracefully float and twirl in garments adorned with iridescent fish-like scales, blurring the boundaries between reality and imagination.

Sora allows creators to transcend the limitations of traditional physics and thought conventions, as stated by Don Allen Stevenson III, the creator of another film. Stevenson notes how collaborating with Sora has shifted his focus from technical obstacles to pure creativity, unlocking a realm of instant visualization and rapid prototyping.

The collection of seven short films also includes one by Nik Kleverov, co-founder and creative director of Native Foreign, a creative agency in Los Angeles. Kleverov believes that Sora will revolutionize his approach to agency work and personal projects, enabling him to explore original concepts that were previously constrained by budget and resources. His film features a compilation of evocative scenes spanning different eras, moods, and visual styles. It transports viewers to a black-and-white noir scene, an old-time clock repair shop with sepia tones, and even a futuristic sports car emerging from beneath the ocean.

OpenAI's Sora text-to-video tool opens up new possibilities for artists, designers, and filmmakers, empowering them to bring their ideas to life with ease. Although there are still improvements to be made, the glimpses of creative potential displayed by Sora are promising. As generative AI continues to evolve, it will undoubtedly reshape the creative landscape and inspire further innovation in storytelling and visual arts.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660206f5826dc2b2a5012a5a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1530,918,x225,y165,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 19:50:18,Innovation,Innovation
