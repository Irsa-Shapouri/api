https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2024/03/24/nyt-strands-22-hints-spangram-and-answers-for-monday-march-25th/,"NYT ‘Strands’ 22 Hints, Spangram And Answers For Monday, March 25th","Welcome to today's guide on how to solve the Strands puzzle! If you're a fan of Wordle, then you'll definitely enjoy this game. Although we don't have a specific name for Strands players, I like to call them ""Stranders."" It has a certain ring to it, don't you think?

Now, let's dive into the puzzle itself. Strands is a word search game with a twist. Each day, you'll be presented with a grid of letters, and your goal is to find a group of words that share a common theme. As you find the theme words, they will be highlighted in blue. But that's not all! There's also a special word called a spangram that links two opposite sides of the board, and it will be highlighted in yellow.

Today's puzzle is particularly tricky, so don't worry if it takes you some time to figure it out. It's all about context and thinking outside the box. And remember, there's always an extra hint to help you along the way. Today's theme hint is ""Sign language,"" and here's an additional clue: ""Constellation.""

Now, I know you're eager to find out the answers, but let's take a moment to appreciate the challenge. The spangram for today's puzzle is ""ASTROLOGY,"" and you can find it on the grid. Once you spot the spangram, it becomes easier to find the rest of the words. Here's the full list:

1. Bull
2. Goat
3. Scorpion
4. Virgin
5. Archer
6. Scales
7. Twins

Quite a tricky set of words, isn't it? I must admit, I had some trouble with a few of them myself. At first, I thought I was looking for animals when I found ""Bull"" and ""Goat,"" but that didn't make much sense in the context of sign language. It wasn't until I came across ""OLOGY"" that I had a breakthrough. I realized I was looking for words that could fit at the beginning of that word. And then it hit me: astrology! Suddenly, everything fell into place. All the previous words were actually constellations. I found ""Archer,"" ""Twins,"" and finally ""Scorpion,"" although that one gave me quite a tough time.

In the end, it's all about perseverance and thinking outside the box. How did you fare with today's Strands puzzle? Let me know on Twitter and Facebook. And remember to check out my blog for daily Wordle guides and other exciting content.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2024/03/24/wwdc-2024-date-exactly-when-apple-will-reveal-iphone-mac-and-ipad-software/,"WWDC 2024 Date: Exactly When Apple Will Reveal iPhone, Mac And iPad Software","Apple's annual developers' conference, known as WWDC or DubDub, is a highly anticipated event that takes place in June. Despite the disruptions caused by Covid-19, Apple has consistently held the conference during this time. The exact details of this year's conference, including the announcement date, location, and format, are eagerly awaited.

In previous years, Apple would have announced the date of WWDC by now, but there have been some deviations from this pattern in recent times. In both 2021 and the previous year, Apple revealed the date in late March, while in 2022, the announcement came in early April. Therefore, it is expected that the date for WWDC 2024 will be confirmed soon.

Traditionally, WWDC has always taken place in early June, with the exception of the Covid-affected year of 2020 when the dates were pushed to late June. In the years prior to and following 2020, the conference has consistently been held in the first full week of June, starting on a Monday and ending on a Friday.

Based on this pattern, it is likely that WWDC 2024 will follow the same dates as in 2019, running from Monday, June 3 to Friday, June 7. However, there is also a possibility that it could take place the following week, from Monday, June 10 to Friday, June 14. This slight variation in dates is not unprecedented, as previous conferences have ended as late as June 11.

In terms of format, WWDC has undergone significant changes since 2020. In that year, the keynote was pre-recorded, and there were no in-person attendees due to the pandemic. This departure from the previous norm, where thousands of people would gather in a large auditorium to watch the live keynote, marked a significant shift.

Since then, every WWDC keynote has been pre-recorded, but in the past two years, Apple has increased the number of attendees at its Cupertino headquarters. While the numbers are still lower than pre-Covid times, there has been a noticeable increase compared to the previous year.

It is expected that this year's conference will follow a similar format, with a pre-recorded keynote featuring live segments from Tim Cook and Craig Federighi at Apple Park. There will also be a limited number of in-person attendees, including VIPs, press, and staff.

As for the timing, Apple has a tradition of scheduling its keynotes for 10 a.m. local time, specifically Pacific Daylight Time. Once the official announcement is made, further details will be provided.

In conclusion, the eagerly awaited WWDC 2024 will likely take place in early June, following the same pattern as previous years. The specific dates will be confirmed soon, and the conference is expected to feature a pre-recorded keynote with live segments. While the format may have changed due to the pandemic, Apple is adapting to ensure a successful and engaging event for attendees. Stay tuned for more updates on this exciting event.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600830c22fb840e0281afe2/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 16:00:15,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have surprising similarities in their growth trajectories. Both companies stumbled upon their core businesses by accident. AWS discovered that it could sell its internal services to others, while Nvidia realized that its gaming-focused GPU was well-suited for processing AI workloads. As a result, both companies have experienced explosive revenue growth.

Nvidia's revenue has grown at an astonishing rate, from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024 to $22.1 billion in Q4 2024. However, the majority of this growth came from the company's data center business. On the other hand, AWS has consistently been a significant revenue driver for Amazon. While Microsoft and Google have also entered the cloud market, both Nvidia and AWS have enjoyed the advantage of being early players.

The cloud market has thrived as web apps and mobile technology emerged, providing on-demand resources for enterprises. Additionally, the rise of AI and large language models has increased the demand for GPUs to process these workloads. AWS has become a highly profitable business, with a run rate close to $100 billion. However, its growth has slowed down, while Nvidia's growth is skyrocketing. This can be attributed, in part, to the law of large numbers.

The big question is whether Nvidia can sustain its growth and become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS. While Nvidia does have other businesses, such as gaming and automotive, they are currently much smaller revenue generators compared to the data center business. It remains to be seen how Nvidia will fare if the GPU market tightens.

In the short term, Nvidia's revenue growth is expected to continue. The company anticipates $24 billion in revenue for its current quarter, a growth rate of around 234% compared to the year-ago quarter. However, as Nvidia's revenue ramps up, its growth rate is projected to decline. Analysts expect the company to generate $110.5 billion in revenue for the current fiscal year, an increase of just over 81% from the previous year. While still impressive, this is significantly lower than the 126% gain in the previous fiscal year.

Despite the expected slowdown in growth, Nvidia is poised for significant momentum in the coming years, thanks to the continued demand for AI technologies. While competition from AMD, Intel, and other chipmakers is on the rise, Nvidia currently holds a dominant position in the market. However, AMD is gaining ground at the board level. Nevertheless, Nvidia remains firmly in control at the chip level.

In conclusion, both Nvidia and AWS have experienced remarkable revenue growth, driven by their respective core businesses. While AWS's growth has slowed down, Nvidia's growth shows no signs of stopping. With the increasing demand for AI technologies, Nvidia has the potential to become a long-term revenue powerhouse. However, it will face competition from other chipmakers in the future. Despite this, Nvidia is well-positioned to maintain its dominance in the market and continue its impressive growth trajectory.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2024/03/24/samsung-has-new-price-offer-promotion-for-galaxy-s24-phone-buyers/,Samsung Has New Price Offer Promotion For Galaxy S24 Phone Buyers,"Samsung has recently released its latest phones, the Galaxy S24, S24 Plus, and S24 Ultra, which are highly capable and efficient devices. However, the price may have deterred some potential buyers. Fortunately, Samsung has introduced trade-in promotions in the U.K. and the U.S., allowing customers to trade in their old phones for a discount on the new devices. While trade-ins are not a new concept, Samsung's offer stands out. Let's delve into the details, starting with the U.K.

Samsung U.K. Trade-In Offers
The trade-in offer in the U.K. allows customers to use any smartphone, regardless of its condition, to receive a $126 (£100) discount on the purchase of a new device. Yes, you read that right – any condition! Even if your old phone has a broken display or a battery that barely lasts a few hours, it still qualifies for the trade-in offer.

But that's not all – the potential savings go even further. According to the Samsung website, customers can save up to £370 by trading in their old phones. The website provides a comprehensive guide, showcasing the trade-in values for various brands, including Samsung, Apple, Google, Huawei, and more. For instance, if you own a Google Pixel 7 Pro, you can enjoy a £270 discount, while an Apple iPhone 14 can get you £300 off. Even a Samsung Galaxy S23 can earn you an impressive £320 discount. These savings are significant and definitely worth considering.

What's particularly interesting is the phrase ""Guaranteed Trade In—Any Device"" in the middle of the list. This means that regardless of the brand or model, you can trade in your old phone and apply for a discount when purchasing a new Samsung device. During the purchase process, you'll need to provide the IMEI number and current condition of your old phone to determine its trade-in value.

Once you've purchased the new phone, you'll need to wipe the data from your old device, remove the SIM card, and send it back to Samsung within seven days using the freepost packaging they provide. It's important to note that failure to send the old device may result in your newly purchased phone being blocked. Make sure to read and adhere to the terms and conditions.

For more information and to explore the U.K. trade-in offers, visit Samsung.com.

Samsung U.S. Trade-In Offers
Customers in the U.S. can also take advantage of trade-in deals, and the discounts available are even more enticing. For example, if you trade in a Galaxy S23 Ultra, you can usually receive a $450 discount on the purchase of a new Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. However, at the moment, Samsung has increased this discount by $300, totaling a whopping $750 off. Similarly, if you trade in a Galaxy Z Fold5, you can now enjoy a $750 discount on the new Ultra, whereas previously it would have been $500.

If you're considering switching from an iPhone to Samsung, you're in luck. By trading in an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max, you can save $750 on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. Previously, the discounts for these devices were $520 and $540, respectively. This is a great opportunity to experience the Samsung Galaxy series while making significant savings.

For customers with smartphones from other Android brands, you can still benefit from a $100 discount. However, Samsung specifies that the device must be in good condition. This means that it should turn on and have a functional screen, charging port, and battery. Additionally, there should be no cracks on the front, back, screen, or camera lenses. Activation locks must be disabled, accounts should be removed, and the phone should be factory reset. It's important to note that the device should not be on a banned list.

These trade-in offers come with specific requirements, but the discounts available are undoubtedly appealing. To explore the U.S. trade-in deals and take advantage of these savings, visit Samsung.com.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/krisholt/2024/03/24/nyt-connections-hints-and-answers-for-monday-march-25/,"NYT ‘Connections’ Hints And Answers For Monday, March 25","Welcome to today's game of Connections! In this challenge, you will be presented with a grid of 16 words and your goal is to arrange them into four groups of four by identifying the links between them. The groups could be related to horror movie franchises, types of verbs, or even rappers. Each puzzle has only one solution, so be careful when selecting words that could fit into multiple categories. If you're stuck, you can shuffle the words to help you see connections.

The groups are color-coded for your convenience. The yellow group is usually the easiest to figure out, followed by the blue and green groups. The purple group is typically the most challenging as it often involves wordplay. Keep that in mind as you strategize your approach.

To play, select four words that you believe belong together and press Submit. If your guess is incorrect, you will lose a life. However, if you're close to a correct group, you may receive a message indicating that you're only one word away from solving it. But you'll still need to determine which word to swap. Be careful though, as making four mistakes will result in a game over. To prevent that from happening, I'll provide you with some hints and, if necessary, the answers to today's Connections.

Let's take a look at today's words:

1. PACE
2. CLIPPER
3. MOVE
4. MEDICINE
5. FASTER
6. PROMPTER
7. ROCKET
8. SPEED
9. GO
10. SPUR
11. COMMUTE
12. HURRY
13. RATE
14. VISION
15. CLIP
16. PACER

Now, here are the hints for each group:

Yellow group — something's swiftness
Green group — speed up!
Blue group — NBA team player
Purple group — linked by a term meaning ""over a long distance""

And here are the answers:

Yellow group — how fast something is going (CLIP, PACE, RATE, SPEED)
Green group — ""step on it!"" (FASTER, GO, HURRY, MOVE)
Blue group — NBA team player (CLIPPER, PACER, ROCKET, SPUR)
Purple group — tele____ (COMMUTE, MEDICINE, PROMPTER, VISION)

Unfortunately, there was no perfect game today, but my overall streak is up to five games in a row. The blues were immediately recognizable, although I suspected they might be a red herring. The greens and yellows were intriguing because they seemed like noun and verb versions of the same concept. After making a small mistake by including COMMUTE with the greens instead of FASTER, I corrected the group and focused on solving the purples, which led me to victory.

That's it for today's Connections clues and answers. If you need hints or the solution for Tuesday's game, be sure to check my blog. Also, here's a quick life tip: make it a point to dine at the best restaurant in your area at least once. Save up for it if you have to. Trust me, the experience will be worth it. While getting takeout is nice, there's something truly special about dining at the top-rated place nearby.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/64dbcee7d64da3663d88000e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 17:30:02,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/technology/article/moba-games/,Top Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) Games,"MOBAs, short for multiplayer online battle arena games, have gained immense popularity over the past 15 years. It all started with a simple modification, or ""mod,"" for a popular strategy game. However, standalone iterations soon emerged, creating a fierce competition to become the top MOBA games in the world. While many challengers have fallen by the wayside, unable to compete with the giants that continue to attract millions of players each month, finding the best MOBA can still be a daunting task for newcomers.

So, what exactly is a multiplayer online battle arena game? A MOBA is an online game that pits two teams, typically consisting of five players, against each other in a strategic battle to destroy the opponent's base using unique player-controlled characters. These games are predominantly played on PC or mobile devices and have gained popularity due to their challenging gameplay mechanics.

The origins of the MOBA genre can be traced back to Warcraft III, a popular strategy game with a thriving modding community. Defense of the Ancients (DotA) is widely regarded as the first MOBA and quickly gained recognition as a major game in its own right, despite being a mod. Subsequently, some members of the DotA mod team left to create their own MOBA, which became known as League of Legends. Valve, the developers of the Steam games platform, also entered the scene by acquiring members of the original DotA team to create Dota 2, a direct competitor to League of Legends. This marked the beginning of a period in which major publishers attempted to build their own MOBAs, although most failed to gain traction.

Over the years, hundreds of MOBAs have been released on various platforms. Some have become global sensations, while others have been forgotten within months. The top MOBA games today are those that have stood the test of time, attracting a large and loyal audience. These games offer unique features or manage to captivate players for years on end. It's no surprise that two of the biggest MOBAs, Dota 2 and League of Legends, have been around for over a decade and continue to innovate in a genre that has seen numerous copycats. These games have garnered critical acclaim from industry experts and are still immensely enjoyable for both new and experienced players.

Dota 2, a direct sequel to the original mod that kickstarted the MOBA genre, has remained one of the most popular games on Steam for over 10 years. While it was technically released in 2013, the beta version was available as early as 2011. Developed by Valve with the involvement of Ice Frog, the lead developer of the original DotA mod, Dota 2 has evolved into a more accessible game while preserving the essence of its predecessor. With map changes, new playable characters, and constant balance adjustments, Dota 2 looks vastly different from its early days. However, at its core, it still revolves around two teams of five battling across a three-lane map to destroy the enemy's Ancient and claim victory. Dota 2 is renowned for its complexity, offering more variables and mechanics than other MOBAs. It takes thousands of hours to master, and even experienced players admit to areas they still don't fully understand. Despite its complexity, Dota 2 is free to play, with optional microtransactions for cosmetic items being the only form of payment.

League of Legends, on the other hand, is the largest MOBA in the world, boasting over 100 million monthly active players. Its success revolutionized the gaming industry and sparked the MOBA craze. Initially released in 2009, League of Legends differentiated itself from the original DotA mod by simplifying certain complex aspects, making it more accessible to newcomers. Developed by Riot Games, which was founded by former members of the DotA mod team, League of Legends retained the basic three-lane map and two teams of five battling to destroy each other's bases. However, it removed some of the less crucial but more intricate elements present in DotA. League of Legends is a highly competitive game that requires teamwork, strategy, and quick reflexes. It has a thriving esports scene, with major tournaments attracting millions of viewers worldwide.

While Dota 2 and League of Legends dominate the MOBA landscape, there are other notable games worth exploring. Heroes of the Storm, developed by Blizzard Entertainment, offers a more casual and accessible MOBA experience. It features characters from various Blizzard franchises, such as Warcraft, Diablo, and StarCraft, making it appealing to fans of these universes. Smite takes a unique approach by adopting a third-person perspective, allowing players to experience the action from a different angle. It features gods and mythological figures from different pantheons, providing a diverse and engaging gameplay experience.

In conclusion, MOBAs have captivated gamers worldwide and continue to be among the most popular games today. With their strategic gameplay, unique characters, and thriving communities, these games offer endless hours of entertainment. Whether you're a seasoned player or new to the genre, there is a MOBA out there for you. So, gather your friends, choose your heroes, and embark on an epic battle to conquer the enemy's base!",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fb05c9fa323af23f667c73/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 14:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/non-sexy-industries-can-appeal-to-investors-too/,Non-sexy industries can appeal to investors too,"TechCrunch Fintech (formerly The Interchange) is back with another exciting edition! This week, we're focusing on the thriving fintech startup scene in Africa, the unexpected benefits that came with Mint's closure for Copilot, and the increased support from venture capitalists for an expense management startup. So, let's dive in and explore the latest happenings in the world of fintech!

Venture funding in Africa has experienced a decline recently, mirroring the global trend. However, there were some positive developments in the African fintech ecosystem this past week. Our reporter, Tage Kene-Okafor, shared the news that African mobility fintech Moove received a $100 million investment led by Uber, bringing its valuation to an impressive $750 million. Additionally, Zone, a decentralized payment infrastructure startup, raised $8.5 million to support its scaling efforts. Another noteworthy story was Annie Njanja's report on Nala, a Tanzanian payments company that successfully pivoted to offer remittance services in 2021 and also built a B2B payment platform along the way.

In the analysis of the week, we explore how Intuit's decision to shut down budgeting app Mint has created opportunities for other startups in the space. Copilot, in particular, has experienced significant growth in the last four months, surpassing its growth in the previous four years. This growth led to a successful $6 million Series A funding round led by Nico Wittenborn's Adjacent. We previously covered Copilot's journey when it first launched with $250,000 in angel funding and later added support for Apple Card. Monarch Money co-founder Ozzie Osman also shared with TechCrunch that Mint's loss proved to be their gain.

Moving on to dollars and cents, we learned that even non-sexy industries can attract investors. Expense management startup Coast has targeted businesses with real-world field personnel and fleets to manage, resulting in a remarkable 550% revenue growth last year. The company recently secured an additional $25 million in equity funding. Digital bank Onyx Private, which initially focused on serving high-earning millennials and Gen Zers, made a pivot to B2B operations. The YC-backed startup raised $4.1 million last year but recently announced the termination of its bank operations and the closure of customer accounts. Finally, Swiss fintech nsave raised $4 million in seed funding to make banking in Switzerland accessible to individuals in countries with unstable banking sectors or high inflation rates.

In other news, Eric Glyman, the co-founder and CEO of Ramp, believes that despite the significant growth in the fintech industry, there is still vast untapped potential. Glyman shared during an interview on the TechCrunch Found podcast that Ramp, a corporate card and expense startup, has only scratched the surface and tapped into 1% of its potential market share. In an interesting coincidence, both Ramp and Deel celebrated their fifth anniversaries this week, just one day apart.

The U.S. Justice Department's antitrust complaint against Apple and its iPhone business has caught our attention. The complaint specifically targets Apple's extensive financial operations, shedding light on the company's dominance in the financial sector.

Here are some other headlines that have piqued our interest:

- Bolt and Checkout.com partner for seamless commerce experience

- Wealthfront postpones its IPO plans
