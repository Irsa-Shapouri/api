https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-vulnerability-virtual-reality.html,Vulnerability in virtual reality systems identified,"Virtual reality (VR) systems have become increasingly popular in recent years, offering users the opportunity to explore immersive virtual worlds. However, a team of computer scientists at the University of Chicago has uncovered a potential vulnerability in VR systems that could pose a significant threat to users' security. This vulnerability, known as an ""inception attack,"" allows hackers to insert an ""inception layer"" between a user's VR home screen and their VR user/server.

The concept behind an inception layer is inspired by the movie ""Inception,"" in which a character is able to download an altered layer of reality into his brain. Similarly, the researchers propose that hackers could add a layer between the user and the virtual world they see when using their VR device. This layer would enable them to record sensitive information, intercept and alter data, and even manipulate the user's virtual environment.

One potential scenario involves the hacker tricking the user into revealing their passcode for a virtual ATM. By inserting an inception layer, the hacker could record the passcode and gain unauthorized access to the user's account. Additionally, the hacker could modify the cash amounts designated for a purchase, redirecting the difference to their own bank account. This kind of manipulation could have serious financial implications for unsuspecting users.

Moreover, the inception layer could be used to deceive users by adding virtual representations of their friends or family members. By gaining the user's trust in this way, the hacker could exploit vulnerabilities and extract valuable information. This could include monitoring gestures, voice emanations, browsing activity, and social or business interactions. The potential for invasive surveillance and manipulation is concerning.

To test the feasibility of such an attack, the researchers enlisted the help of 28 volunteers who played a game using a demonstration VR headset. They downloaded a simulated hacking app onto the devices without the volunteers' knowledge and observed their reactions. Surprisingly, only 10 of the volunteers noticed a slight flickering during the download and activation process, and only one questioned the possibility of nefarious activity. This suggests that users may be largely unaware of the risks posed by inception attacks.

The research team promptly notified Meta, the company behind the Meta Quest VR system used in the experiment, of their findings. Meta has responded by pledging to investigate the vulnerability and take appropriate measures to address it. However, the researchers caution that similar vulnerabilities are likely to exist in other VR systems and apps. It is crucial for developers and manufacturers across the industry to prioritize security and protect users from potential threats.

As VR technology continues to advance and become more integrated into everyday life, it is essential to remain vigilant and informed about the potential risks. Users should exercise caution when downloading apps and connecting to WiFi networks, as hackers may exploit vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access. By raising awareness of inception attacks and promoting robust security measures, we can ensure a safer VR experience for all users.

In conclusion, the discovery of the inception attack vulnerability in VR systems serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of cybersecurity in our increasingly digital world. This research sheds light on the potential for hackers to manipulate users' virtual environments and extract sensitive information. By addressing these vulnerabilities and implementing robust security measures, we can continue to enjoy the benefits of virtual reality while safeguarding our privacy and security.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/vulnerability-in-virtu.jpg,2024-03-25 10:20:02,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-liquid-iron-battery-grid-energy.html,New all-liquid iron flow battery for grid energy storage,"Flow batteries holds great promise for large-scale energy storage, allowing for the integration of intermittent energy sources like wind and solar power into the electric grid. Researchers at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have made a breakthrough in flow battery technology by repurposing a common chemical used in water treatment facilities. The battery design utilizes a liquid electrolyte made with Earth-abundant materials, specifically a chemical called nitrogenous triphosphonate (NTMPA) which is commercially available in industrial quantities.

What sets this battery apart is its ability to store charged iron in a liquid complex at room temperature and neutral pH. This is achieved by combining the charged iron with the NTMPA electrolyte. The researchers found that their iron-based battery exhibited remarkable cycling stability, maintaining 98.7% of its maximum capacity over one thousand consecutive charging cycles. This is a significant improvement compared to previous studies on iron-based batteries, which reported much higher degradation of charge capacity over fewer charging cycles.

Flow batteries operate by storing energy in chemical bonds through an electrochemical reaction. Unlike conventional batteries, flow batteries have two chambers filled with different liquids and require a constant supply of electrolyte to function. The larger the electrolyte supply tank, the more energy the flow battery can store. This makes flow batteries ideal for large-scale energy storage applications and they can be built at any scale, from a lab-bench to the size of a city block.

The use of flow batteries as backup generators for the electric grid is a key strategy in decarbonizing the energy sector. These batteries can be located in urban or suburban areas near energy consumers, providing a reliable and sustainable energy source. The aqueous iron flow battery developed by the researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory operates in water at neutral pH, making it safer and more environmentally friendly compared to other battery technologies.

The initial design of the iron-based flow battery achieved an energy density of up to 9 watt-hours per liter (Wh/L). While this is lower than commercialized vanadium-based systems, which have an energy density of 25 Wh/L, the use of Earth-abundant materials allows for scalability to provide the same energy output. This means that a flow battery made with common and readily available materials can be just as effective as other high-density battery systems.

The development of flow battery technology is crucial for modernizing the electric grid and facilitating the widespread adoption of renewable energy sources. With the ability to store energy from intermittent sources like wind and solar power, flow batteries provide a reliable and sustainable solution for meeting the energy demands of the future. The research conducted by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory represents a significant step forward in flow battery design, offering a safe, economical, and efficient energy storage solution.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/new-all-liquid-iron-fl.jpg,2024-03-25 07:22:25,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/telegrams-peer-to-peer-sms-login-service-is-a-privacy-nightmare/,Telegram’s peer-to-peer SMS login service is a privacy nightmare,"Telegram, the popular instant messaging app, has recently introduced a new and controversial feature. Users can now obtain a free premium membership by allowing the app to utilize their phone number as a relay for sending one-time SMS passwords to other users attempting to log into the platform. While this may sound like a great deal, there are concerns about potential privacy risks and the exposure of personal information.

This new feature, initially reported by the TGInfoEn Telegram channel, is currently being rolled out in select countries for Telegram for Android users. If you agree to let Telegram use your phone number as an OTP (one-time password) relay, the company will reward you with a transferable code for Telegram Premium.

However, before jumping on board, it's crucial to understand the terms and conditions of this peer-to-peer login program. Telegram states that they will send a maximum of 150 OTP messages per month. While participating users may also be charged for local and international SMS usage, they will need to meet a certain quota in order to qualify for the complimentary subscription. In some cases, the cost of these SMS messages may exceed the value of the Telegram Premium membership, making it less enticing from a financial perspective.

Privacy is another major concern with this feature. By allowing your phone number to be used as a relay, you are essentially granting strangers the ability to look up your number and potentially use it for spam and fraudulent activities. Telegram does offer the option to hide your phone number from strangers, but utilizing it as a relay could compromise the privacy of your Telegram account.

The terms and conditions clearly state that Telegram will not be held liable for any damages or unforeseen consequences that may arise from participating in the peer-to-peer login program. In fact, they are granted absolute indemnity from all claims related to this feature. This means that if any issues or problems arise, the onus falls on the user, not Telegram.

Telegram does advise users not to engage with individuals who receive an OTP code from their number, but there is no way for the company to enforce this recommendation. Ultimately, it is up to the users themselves to exercise caution and make informed decisions.

It's worth noting that Telegram introduced a subscription service two years ago, offering features such as transcription, exclusive stickers, and reactions, among others. Paid users also have access to features like Stories. However, for those considering the peer-to-peer login system, it is important to weigh the benefits against the potential risks of sharing your phone number with strangers.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/bankrupt-ev-startup-arrival-sold-its-assets-to-canoo/,Bankrupt EV startup Arrival sold its assets to Canoo,"Bankrupt electric vehicle (EV) startup Arrival has sold some of its assets, including advanced manufacturing equipment, to struggling startup Canoo. Canoo, which is also in the EV market, hopes that this acquisition will help reduce its capital expenditures by 20%. The purchased assets, which are being transported in more than 20 container ships, will be sent to Canoo's facility in Oklahoma. Canoo has previously acquired all the new and ""like-new"" assets owned by Arrival's US business unit. It is unknown whether Canoo has also acquired any of Arrival's intellectual property.

Arrival announced in January that it planned to sell off assets and intellectual property from its UK division after filing for bankruptcy protection. Once valued at over $13 billion and backed by Hyundai and UPS, Arrival aimed to revolutionize EV production by building compact ""microfactories"" in city centers. However, the company's plans fell apart as it faced financial difficulties and the departure of several executives. Arrival restructured multiple times, resulting in layoffs, and shifted its focus from the UK to the US to conserve capital. The company never achieved large-scale production of commercial vehicles and is now valued at around $7.7 million. After years of volatility and a significant loss in share price, Arrival filed for bankruptcy.

Canoo has faced its own challenges. After going public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, the company struggled to produce its EV, which features an eye-catching design based on a ""skateboard"" architecture. This architecture houses the batteries and electric drivetrain underneath the vehicle's cabin. Canoo has reported having over $1 billion in its sales pipeline, largely due to a deal with Walmart for the purchase of 4,500 units, with an option for up to 10,000 units. However, Canoo has faced difficulties in converting these sales into deliveries. The company is currently burning through cash and has had to resort to stock splits and issuing more shares to stay afloat. In 2020, Canoo moved to a different tier in the Nasdaq Exchange after its stock price fell below $1, triggering a delisting notice.

Both Arrival and Canoo are struggling in a highly competitive EV market. However, this acquisition presents an opportunity for Canoo to strengthen its position and potentially overcome some of its production challenges. By acquiring Arrival's assets, Canoo can benefit from advanced manufacturing equipment and potentially accelerate its path to commercial production. Canoo's deal with Walmart also provides a promising sales pipeline, but the company must focus on converting those sales into successful deliveries to secure its future in the EV industry.

Overall, the EV market is evolving rapidly, with numerous startups vying for success. As these companies navigate financial difficulties and production challenges, strategic acquisitions and partnerships may prove crucial in their quest for sustainability and market dominance. The future of Arrival and Canoo will depend on their ability to adapt, innovate, and deliver high-quality EVs that meet the demands of consumers and contribute to a sustainable future.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/canoo-walmart-arkansas.jpg?resize=1200,670",2024-03-25 22:15:20,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-pairing-crypto-green-hydrogen-energy.html,"Pairing crypto mining with green hydrogen offers clean energy boost, study suggests","Pairing cryptocurrency mining, known for its high carbon emissions, with green hydrogen technology could be a key driver in the transition to renewable energy, according to a study conducted by Cornell University. The research, titled ""Climate Sustainability Through a Dynamic Duo: Green Hydrogen and Crypto Driving Energy Transition and Decarbonization,"" explores the potential of combining energy-intensive cryptocurrency mining with green hydrogen production to boost renewable energy sectors.

Cryptocurrency mining currently contributes significantly to global carbon emissions. Therefore, it is crucial to explore opportunities to harness the enthusiasm for cryptocurrency and move towards a sustainable future. Fengqi You, a professor of energy systems engineering at Cornell, emphasizes the importance of building a green hydrogen infrastructure to accelerate renewable energy production.

The study suggests that using clean energy sources to power blockchain mining operations and produce green hydrogen can lead to the expansion of wind and solar capacity, thus promoting sustainable energy production across the country. Presently, mining blockchain-based cryptocurrency in the U.S. consumes as much carbon-based energy as the entire country of Argentina. The electricity used for crypto-mining is driven by energy-intensive consensus mechanisms, known as ""proof of work.""

According to preliminary estimates by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, cryptocurrency mining's electricity consumption may represent between 0.6% and 2.3% of all U.S. electricity consumption in 2023. Recognizing the substantial energy demands of cryptocurrency mining, the researchers propose an innovative technology solution that leverages cryptocurrencies as virtual energy carriers in conjunction with green hydrogen production. This approach transforms the environmental challenge posed by cryptocurrency mining into a force for climate mitigation and sustainability.

The research conducted by Fengqi You and Apoorv Lal also assesses the energy strengths of individual U.S. states.

For instance, for each Bitcoin mined in New Mexico, approximately 78.4 megawatt hours of solar power could be produced, while each Bitcoin mined in Wyoming has the potential to generate around 265.8 megawatt hours of wind power.

Cryptocurrency holds an energy value similar to a virtual gift card. Therefore, by advancing a sustainable future for blockchain-based cryptocurrency, it becomes possible to mitigate its environmental impact and pave the way for a renewable energy transition. However, the researchers stress the need for stronger federal policies focused on climate goals and renewable energy to support this approach.

In conclusion, the combination of cryptocurrency mining and green hydrogen technology presents a novel and sustainable strategy for the energy transition. By leveraging cryptocurrencies as virtual energy carriers and embracing green hydrogen, it is possible to transform the environmental challenges associated with crypto-mining into opportunities for climate mitigation and sustainability. With the support of stronger federal policies, this approach has the potential to drive renewable energy sectors and contribute to a greener future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2023/cryptocurrencies.jpg,2024-03-25 15:00:02,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-method-quantum-mechanics-lithium-metal.html,New method that uses quantum mechanics can lead to improved lithium metal batteries,"In a recent study published in Nature Energy, researchers Dr. Perla Balbuena and Dr. Jorge Seminario from Texas A&M University have developed a groundbreaking method for understanding the impact of external pressure on lithium-metal batteries. By using quantum mechanics, they aim to improve the fabrication processes of these batteries, leading to longer-lasting and more efficient technologies.

The research conducted by Balbuena and Seminario falls under the Battery500 Consortium, a collaboration among national labs and academia focused on developing reliable and high-performing vehicle batteries. Led by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, the consortium aims to achieve the goals set by the Department of Energy.

Lithium-ion batteries have revolutionized the world of mobile electronics, enabling the development of compact devices that we can easily carry in our pockets. Despite their widespread use in smartphones, watches, laptops, and electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries still face significant challenges. One of the most pressing issues is their limited energy density, which is dictated by the battery components.

According to Seminario, lithium-ion batteries operate by converting lithium ions into neutral species, storing their energy as chemical energy. The energy is then transformed back into ions, allowing for the transport of electrical energy. The anode, or the negative electrode, contains lithium ions with maximum energy, while the cathode, or the positive electrode, holds lithium ions with minimum energy. This energy difference causes the lithium ions to migrate from the anode to the cathode during discharge, powering the external device.

To overcome the limitations of current lithium-ion batteries, researchers are exploring alternative materials. One promising avenue is replacing the conventional graphite anode with lithium metal, which has the potential to increase energy density by a factor of ten within the anode. However, the reactivity of lithium metal requires innovative control measures, such as applying external pressure to the battery.

While the impact of external pressure on cell performance is known, there is limited research on its relationship with the electroplating of lithium in large-format pouch cells. Additionally, during the assembly and cycling of the battery, its components may undergo volume changes, leading to cell swelling and affecting overall performance and cycle life.

The research conducted by Balbuena and Seminario focuses on understanding why pressure can lead to a more uniform distribution of lithium ions on the anode, preventing the formation of dendrites that could short-circuit the battery. By employing theoretical-computational techniques, the researchers meticulously analyzed the effects of pressure on lithium-metal anodes.

Through their analysis, the team discovered that lithium ions tend to detour towards regions with elevated pressure or a higher concentration of lithium atoms on the surface. This behavior is influenced by the electric field generated by the lithium-metal anode.

This significant finding allows researchers to predict the behavior of novel materials proposed for advanced applications. By understanding how ions behave under different conditions, the widespread use of lithium-metal batteries with longer battery life and increased functionality can become a reality, all while utilizing less expensive infrastructure and fabrication processes.

The work conducted by Balbuena and Seminario demonstrates the impact of first-principles ab initio analysis on the design of macroscopic processes.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/match-board-directors-after-talks-activist-investor-elliott-management/,Match appoints two board directors after talks with activist investor Elliott Management,"Tinder-owner Match Group has recently made some significant moves within its organization. The company announced on Monday that it has appointed Laura Jones, Chief Marketing Officer at Instacart, and Spencer Rascoff, co-founder of Zillow, to join its board of directors. This decision follows a period of ""constructive dialogue"" with activist investor Elliott Management, as the two parties have entered into an ""information-sharing"" agreement. The news comes after reports earlier this year that Elliott had acquired a stake of approximately $1 billion in Match Group.

Elliott's interest in Match Group stems from concerns about the company's declining number of paying users amid a period of economic uncertainty. The investor has expressed a desire to work with Match to explore opportunities for improving its performance. In a press release, Marc Steinberg, a partner at Elliott, stated that they believe in Match Group's potential for significant value creation as a global leader in online dating. Steinberg also expressed appreciation for the collaboration with Match's management and board, and expressed confidence in the new board members, Laura Jones and Spencer Rascoff, and their ability to support the company's growth in the future.

Elliott Management is known for its involvement in the tech industry, often acquiring stakes in companies and advocating for changes to be made. Match Group is not the first company to experience this, as Elliott has previously instigated board shakeups at Crown Castle and Etsy.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, Match Group saw a 5% decrease in the number of total paid users compared to the previous year, with a total of 15.2 million. This decline in growth is a departure from the peaks Match reached during the COVID-19 pandemic, and has resulted in a significant drop in the company's stock price, experiencing a decline of 79% from its 2021 peak.

Match Group is the parent company of several popular dating apps, including Tinder, Hinge, Match.com, Meetic, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, and OurTime. These platforms have gained significant traction and have become household names in the world of online dating.

Overall, Match Group's recent appointments and collaboration with Elliott Management demonstrate the company's commitment to addressing its challenges and finding ways to maintain its position as a global leader in the online dating industry. With the addition of Laura Jones and Spencer Rascoff to its board, Match Group is positioning itself for the next phase of growth and innovation.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1241790742.jpeg?w=1024,2024-03-25 14:15:04,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/25/google-update-warning-chrome-windows-11-android-iphone/,Google’s New AI Search Goes Horribly Wrong-M Is For Malware,"Google’s new AI search, called Search Generative Experience (SGE), has encountered some serious issues right out of the gate. While Google aims to revolutionize search with generative AI, the initial results have been far from ideal. An SEO consultant testing the new technology discovered numerous scams within the search results. Bleeping Computer confirmed these findings, warning that the AI-powered algorithms were recommending scam sites that redirected users to malicious Chrome extensions, fake iPhone giveaways, browser spam subscriptions, and tech support scams.

The problem with generative AI is that these dangers are disguised in friendly and conversational language, catching users off-guard. Many of the scams targeted personal information, adware, or unwanted subscriptions to earn commission payments. Some links even posed more serious threats, such as search hijacking and other malicious activities.

Google responded by stating that they continuously update their anti-spam systems to protect users, and they have taken action to remove the problematic examples. However, these issues raise concerns about the widespread implementation of SGE. Although the reported examples were from an opt-in user in Search Labs, there is a risk that these problems could affect a larger audience.

Despite these initial setbacks, AI search is undoubtedly the future. However, it is crucial for users to exercise caution and adhere to the usual rules of safe searching, even with the introduction of AI. As search becomes more integrated with generative AI chatbots, the potential for exploitation and new tricks increases. It is imperative that filters and defenses are significantly improved before this integration takes place.

In conclusion, while Google’s AI-powered search has faced some challenges, it is a glimpse into the future of search technology. However, users must remain vigilant and aware of potential risks. As AI evolves and becomes more integrated, it is essential to prioritize user safety and enhance the protective measures in place. By doing so, we can fully embrace the benefits of AI search without compromising security.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6602155031526c87ed877205/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3115,2027,x1040,y734,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 21:15:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/london-regtech-gss-raises-47m-to-help-banks-screen-for-global-sanctions/,London regtech GSS raises $47M to help banks screen for global sanctions,"Global Screening Services (GSS), a London-based regulatory compliance platform, has successfully raised $47 million in funding. The company specializes in assisting financial institutions in meeting their global sanctions obligations, which have become increasingly important as economic sanctions have surged. Countries like the United States have imposed trade restrictions and asset blocking against states such as Russia, China, and Iran. 

GSS was founded by Tom Scampion, who previously served as the head of financial crime for Deloitte's EMEA arm. In 2020, Scampion became a general partner at consulting firm AlixPartners, where GSS was initially incubated before becoming an independent entity in 2021. Last year, GSS secured a similar amount of funding from prominent investors, including Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), one of the largest banks globally. In its most recent funding round, GSS attracted additional support from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), along with Cynosure Group and AlixPartners. 

Financial institutions often find themselves at the forefront of sanctions enforcement due to their role in facilitating global money flow. However, identifying who is involved in these transactions is not always straightforward. For instance, in 2019, Standard Chartered was fined $1.1 billion by regulators in the UK and the US for inadequate money-laundering controls and breaching sanctions against countries like Iran. Similarly, BNP Paribas was fined a staggering $8.9 billion in 2014 for processing financial transactions on behalf of sanctioned countries. 

As a result, investors have shown increasing interest in regulatory compliance businesses in recent years. Companies like New York-based Droit and London-based SteelEye have also received significant funding, with Droit raising $23 million and SteelEye securing $21 million in financing. GSS offers a sanctions-screening platform to help banks and other financial institutions comply with regulations. These institutions input transaction data into GSS's cloud-based platform, which then cross-references the data against a standardized set of sanctions lists from around the world. GSS also enhances these lists with additional data points, such as dates of birth and International Maritime Organization (IMO) numbers for ships. They also incorporate data from the local financial transfer systems of sanctioned countries like Russia and China. 

In addition to these services, GSS provides ""enhanced"" lists for screening, which include companies that are partially owned by individuals, companies, or governments that have been sanctioned by authorities like the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the European Union (EU), or the United Kingdom (U.K.). With the recent funding injection, GSS is transitioning from its development phase to becoming fully operational. The company is now preparing to go live with its first customers. 

This significant funding round highlights the growing importance of regulatory compliance in the financial industry. As economic sanctions continue to impact global business, companies like GSS play a crucial role in helping financial institutions navigate complex regulations and avoid costly fines. With its advanced screening platform, GSS is well-positioned to support banks and other institutions in meeting their global sanctions obligations effectively and efficiently.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1770041999-e1711386339681.jpg?resize=1200,677",2024-03-25 18:36:37,Innovation,Innovation
