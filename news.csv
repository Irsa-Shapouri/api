https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2024/03/24/wwdc-2024-date-exactly-when-apple-will-reveal-iphone-mac-and-ipad-software/,"WWDC 2024 Date: Exactly When Apple Will Reveal iPhone, Mac And iPad Software","Apple's annual developers' conference, known as WWDC or DubDub, is a highly anticipated event for tech enthusiasts and Apple fans alike. It is held in June every year, and despite the disruptions caused by Covid-19, it is expected to proceed as scheduled this year. In this article, we will explore when and where WWDC 2024 will take place, when the announcement will be made, and what format we can expect.

In previous years, Apple would typically announce the date of WWDC around this time. However, in the last three years, the announcement has been delayed. In 2021 and the previous year, the date was revealed in late March, while in 2022, it was announced in early April. Therefore, we can expect the dates for WWDC 2024 to be confirmed in the coming days.

As for the actual event, WWDC is traditionally held in early June, unless there are extraordinary circumstances such as a pandemic. In 2020, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the dates were pushed to late June. Nevertheless, in the years preceding and following 2020, WWDC has consistently taken place in the first full week of June, starting on a Monday and concluding on a Friday.

Based on this pattern, it is likely that WWDC 2024 will follow the same dates as in 2019: Monday, June 3 to Friday, June 7. However, there is also a possibility that it could occur the following week, from Monday, June 10 to Friday, June 14. This timeframe is not considered late for WWDC, as previous conferences have extended as far as June 11.

In terms of format, WWDC has undergone significant changes since 2020. In that year, the keynote address was pre-recorded, and there were no in-person attendees. This departure from the norm was a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, which prevented large gatherings. Prior to 2020, thousands of people would gather in a large auditorium to watch the keynote live.

Since then, every WWDC keynote has been pre-recorded, but Apple has gradually increased the number of attendees at its Cupertino venue. Although the numbers are still significantly lower than pre-pandemic years, last year's attendance was higher than the previous year. It is reasonable to assume that the format will remain the same for WWDC 2024, with a pre-recorded keynote featuring Tim Cook and Craig Federighi, as well as a limited number of in-person attendees, including VIPs, press, staff, and a small audience.

It is worth noting that Apple always schedules its keynotes for 10 a.m. local time, specifically Pacific Daylight Time. This means that the event will likely begin at that time.

As soon as the official announcement is made, I will provide a detailed report on the dates, format, and any other relevant information regarding WWDC 2024. Stay tuned for the latest updates on this highly anticipated event!",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600830c22fb840e0281afe2/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 16:00:15,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have more in common than you might think. Both companies experienced significant growth due to their core businesses emerging from unexpected opportunities. AWS realized it could sell internal services, such as storage and compute, while Nvidia discovered that its gaming GPU was well-suited for AI workloads. As a result, both companies have seen explosive revenue growth, with Nvidia's revenue increasing from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024 to $22.1 billion in Q4 2024.

While AWS has consistently been a big revenue driver for Amazon, its growth has started to slow down. On the other hand, Nvidia's growth shows no signs of stopping. However, there are concerns about whether Nvidia can sustain this growth in the long term, especially if the GPU market becomes more competitive. Nvidia does have other businesses, but they are smaller revenue generators that are growing at a slower rate than the GPU data center business.

In the short term, Nvidia's financial outlook is positive. The company expects to generate $24 billion in revenue in its current quarter, representing a 234% growth compared to the same quarter last year. While Nvidia's growth rate is expected to decline, it is still impressive considering its massive revenue ramp in recent quarters. Analysts predict that Nvidia will generate $110.5 billion in revenue in its current fiscal year, an 81% increase from the previous year.

Despite the potential challenges from competitors like AMD and Intel, Nvidia is well-positioned in the market. It controls a significant portion of the chip market and continues to dominate in terms of market share. However, AMD is gaining ground at the board level, indicating increased competition. Nevertheless, Nvidia remains confident in its momentum and expects continued growth in the coming years, fueled by the increasing demand for AI technologies.

In conclusion, Nvidia's growth trajectory resembles that of AWS, with both companies capitalizing on unexpected opportunities. While AWS's growth has slowed down, Nvidia's revenue continues to soar. The company's short-term financial outlook is positive, and it is well-positioned to maintain its dominance in the chip market. Although competition is expected to increase, Nvidia remains confident in its ability to sustain growth and capitalize on the expanding AI market.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2024/03/24/apple-ios-18-biggest-ever-iphone-update-more-details-emerge/,Apple iOS 18 Biggest-Ever iPhone Update: More Details Emerge,"Apple is gearing up to release iOS 18, the next iteration of its operating software for iPhones, at the World Wide Developers Conference in June. According to a recent leak, this update is expected to be the most significant one yet.

One of the key areas that Apple is focusing on with iOS 18 is the home screen. Over the years, we've seen various changes to the home screen, from the transition from an all-black background to colorful wallpapers and the ability to add personal photos. Visual enhancements like the Depth Effect, which creates a floating effect for app icons, have also been introduced. More recently, Apple added widgets, a feature that was already available on Android phones but was implemented more seamlessly on the iPhone.

In iOS 18, the home screen is set to become even more customizable. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, known for his accurate Apple predictions, teases that there will be exciting improvements similar to what we saw with the lock screen in iOS 16. This means users can expect a greater level of personalization and control over their home screen layout.

Gurman has been vocal about his excitement for this year's iOS update, stating that it is regarded as one of the biggest updates in Apple's history. This anticipation suggests that we can expect some groundbreaking features and improvements across the board. Apple's developers conference in June is definitely something to look forward to.

In addition to the revamped home screen, Apple is also focusing on AI tools that aim to enhance users' daily lives. While details are scarce, it's been reported that Apple is in talks with Google to incorporate Gemini generative AI features into the iPhone. These AI tools are expected to offer advanced functionalities that assist users with managing their routines and tasks.

Another area of improvement is Siri, Apple's virtual assistant. Rumors suggest that Siri will undergo a significant upgrade with the help of AI and large-language models. This upgrade aims to make Siri a more advanced personal assistant with improved natural conversation abilities and deeper integration with Apple iMessage. Furthermore, iOS 18 will lay the groundwork for Rich Communication Services (RCS), which will enhance the interoperability between iPhone and Android messages. While this won't change the iconic blue iMessage bubbles, it will offer better compatibility and functionality for cross-platform messaging.

As we eagerly await the release of iOS 18, it's clear that Apple has big plans for its flagship operating system. With promises of a more customizable home screen, AI tools, and improvements to Siri, this update is shaping up to be a game-changer. Stay tuned for more details as we approach the official unveiling in June.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65e217bee36cf08eab202281/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2492,1662,x0,y102,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 13:00:50,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2024/03/24/unveiling-the-journey-of-a-social-media-influencer/,Unveiling The Journey Of A Social Media Influencer,"How I Became a Social Media Influencer and Transformed My Life

Social media has become an integral part of our lives, offering numerous opportunities for self-expression, connection, and even career advancement. As an individual who has experienced the transformative power of social media firsthand, I can confidently say that becoming a social media influencer has had a profound impact on my life.

In the early stages of my social media journey, I must admit that I didn't fully grasp the potential, both positive and negative, that this platform held. Like many others, I used social media casually, sharing random thoughts and selfies without any clear purpose or intention. However, there came a point when I realized that I had a unique story to tell, one that could potentially inspire and resonate with others.

It was at this turning point that I decided to share my personal experiences, strengths, and hopes with the world. I became more vulnerable and relatable through my posts, opening up about my challenges and triumphs. This shift in approach proved to be a game-changer. Gradually, my following began to grow, and I started receiving messages from thousands of people who found solace, inspiration, and a sense of connection through my content.

Social media is often criticized for its abundance of negativity and cyberbullying. Recognizing this, I developed a set of criteria to guide my content creation process. Before posting anything, I ask myself three crucial questions: Will this be helpful to others? Is this something I genuinely want to contribute to the world? Is this something I need to hear myself? If the answer to all three questions is a resounding yes, then I proceed with sharing it.

This approach has not only allowed me to create content that adds value to the lives of others but has also brought about significant personal growth. Social media has become the foundation upon which I have built my career, an invaluable source of knowledge and connection. I consider myself extremely fortunate to have cultivated a positive online presence, shielded from the hate and negativity that many influencers unfortunately encounter.

My catchphrase, ""Negativity Be Gone,"" has become more than just a slogan. It is a mantra that I live by, a conscious decision to create a space of positivity in my life. By intentionally shutting out negativity, I have opened myself up to a world filled with optimism, inspiration, and endless possibilities. It truly feels like a breath of fresh air.

Becoming a social media influencer has allowed me to leverage the power of this platform for personal and professional growth. It has given me a voice, a platform to share my story, and a way to connect with like-minded individuals from all walks of life. Through social media, I have discovered a community of individuals who uplift and support one another, creating a network of positivity and empowerment.

In conclusion, my journey as a social media influencer has been marked by personal growth, connection, and the opportunity to make a positive impact on the lives of others. By embracing vulnerability, focusing on positivity, and sharing my authentic self, I have found my purpose and transformed my life. Social media, when used with intention and authenticity, has the power to shape our lives for the better.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fa921a8a459a2ef2abbef0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 11:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/technology/article/what-are-rpg-games/,What Is A Role-Playing Game? RPG Types Explained,"Role-playing games (RPGs) have different meanings for different people. Some enjoy sitting around a table, rolling dice, and creating stories with friends, while others prefer interactive storylines and character builds. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or a newcomer to RPGs, this guide will introduce you to the most common types of role-playing games and help you find the right game to try or expand your horizons.

What Are Role-Playing Games?

Role-playing games allow players to assume the role of a character within a game that serves as a story. The choices made by players affect both their character and the direction of the story. Sometimes, the story is controlled by a computer, while other times it is controlled by another player.

The most common structure of an RPG involves players taking on the role of a single character. They have control over their character's appearance, actions, and abilities within the story. Characters remain part of the story until they die, are removed by a game element, or when a player wishes to switch to a different character.

In this traditional setup, one player serves as the Game Master, also known as the Dungeon Master, Judge, Referee, Keeper, or by some other evocative title. The Game Master keeps the story on track, reacts to player actions, plays supporting or antagonist characters, and resolves any rule disputes that may arise. Game Mastering can be a challenging but rewarding role for players who want to be at the center of every game session.

Some RPGs offer a more collaborative structure, where everyone has equal control over the narrative. The game's rules determine who controls the story at any given time. These games often aim to emulate a particular style of fiction or the atmosphere of other media forms like film or television.

Dungeons & Dragons is widely regarded as the first role-playing game, with few games before it capturing an audience like it did. First published in 1974, it has since inspired hundreds of other games, including many video games. RPGs on home computers and game consoles began in the 1980s and have become increasingly elaborate over the years.

Even today, Dungeons & Dragons remains the most popular tabletop role-playing game on the market. It has also made a significant impact on the computer side of gaming with titles like Baldur's Gate 3. However, there are numerous other RPGs to explore, each with its unique strengths that appeal to their respective fan bases.

Types Of RPGs

Role-playing games come in various types, often blurring the lines with different features and focuses. Here are some of the most common styles of RPGs, along with a few examples:

1. MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game)
MMORPGs are played online by thousands, or even millions, of people. Players log into a central server, create and develop their characters, and embark on missions. Some servers prioritize missions and character performance, while others encourage role-playing and staying in character at all times. World of Warcraft remains the most popular MMORPG, with other notable examples including Guild Wars 2, EVE Online, Star Wars The Old Republic, and Black Desert Online.

2. ARPG (Action Role-Playing Game)
Action role-playing games focus heavily on combat as a core component. Players must learn how to fight and equip their characters effectively. These games often revolve around single-player battles, although some include multiplayer elements. The Diablo series is an excellent example of this type of RPG, along with Elder Ring, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Borderlands.

3. CRPG (Computer or Console Role-Playing Game)
CRPGs encompass RPGs played on computers or video game consoles. They typically offer a single-player, pre-scripted experience, where players follow a specific storyline with some room for exploration within dungeons or other enclosed areas. Games from Bioware, such as Mass Effect and Dragon Age, are often associated with this category. Other notable examples include Planescape: Torment, Disco Elysium, and Shadowrun Returns.

4. JRPG (Japanese Role-Playing Game)
Japanese Role-Playing Games originated on game consoles and often blend genres like fantasy and science fiction. These games emphasize party management and finding drama within the relationships that drive the ""save the world"" storyline.

While these are just a few examples, the world of RPGs is vast and diverse. Exploring different types of role-playing games can lead to new and exciting experiences, allowing you to fully immerse yourself in fantastical worlds and engaging narratives.

Conclusion

Role-playing games offer a unique and immersive experience, allowing players to become part of a story and shape its direction through their choices. Whether you prefer the collaborative nature of RPGs or the action-packed battles of ARPGs, there is a game out there to suit your tastes.

Dungeons & Dragons, as the first and most influential RPG, continues to captivate players and inspire countless others. However, don't limit yourself to just one game. Explore the vast array of RPGs available and discover the unique strengths and experiences that each one offers.

So, whether you're a seasoned RPG player or someone looking to dive into this exciting genre for the first time, there's a role-playing game waiting for you. Choose your game, gather your friends, and embark on an unforgettable adventure. The possibilities are endless in the world of role-playing games.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fb562b1ede4feb9fc02f0c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1795,1010,x0,y92,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 12:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/techcrunch-mobility-the-wheels-are-starting-to-come-off-the-fisker-ev-bus/,TechCrunch Mobility: The wheels are starting to come off the Fisker EV bus,"Welcome to TechCrunch Mobility, your go-to source for all things transportation. In this week's newsletter, we'll be discussing the latest updates in the automotive industry, as well as some exciting developments in the world of electric vehicles (EVs) and startups.

Before we delve into the startup and tech news, let's first address some significant changes happening on Capitol Hill. The Biden Administration has recently proposed two new standards through the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that will have a profound impact on U.S. automakers and consumers alike. While these regulations have been slightly softened to accommodate the automotive industry, they still impose stricter standards than before.

The DOE has introduced a ""petroleum equivalency factor"" that assigns a score to EVs under the government's corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. The original proposal would have made it challenging for automakers to meet these standards, resulting in billions of dollars in fines. On the other hand, the EPA has released tailpipe standards for 2027 to 2032 model year vehicles, which impose more stringent requirements on automakers but also allow flexibility in meeting these rules through various powertrains. These standards are technology-agnostic and can be achieved without transitioning the entire fleet to battery electric vehicles (BEVs).

So, what does this mean for EV startups? Well, not much, as BEVs such as those produced by Rivian, Tesla, and Lucid already meet the clean car standard of limiting CO2 emissions to 85 grams per mile by 2032. However, legacy automakers, who invest billions in developing and selling EVs while still profiting from internal combustion engine vehicles, will face significant implications. In this context, plug-in hybrids may emerge as the winners.

Now, let's move on to the latest news in the industry. We've got some exciting articles lined up, including Rivian's partnership with Tesla, the rise of electric boat startup Candela, and the ongoing financial challenges faced by Fisker. We'll also take a look at a startup tackling extended warranties and more!

But before we dive into those stories, let's talk about Clevon, a company that specializes in autonomous delivery technology. Last month, there were rumors that the company was struggling to secure new investments and was on the verge of shutting down. However, the latest update suggests that Clevon is still operational and has actually entered into an exclusivity agreement for its merger with an American electric vehicle company. This deal is expected to be finalized by the first half of June, although the company is making some cost reductions in the meantime, resulting in layoffs.

In other news, Uber, the ubiquitous ride-hailing company, has made its first investment in an Africa-founded startup. Moove, a mobility fintech company that provides vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers, recently raised $100 million in a Series B funding round led by Uber. This investment aligns with Uber's commitment to achieving a fully zero-emission fleet by 2040, as Moove has made electric vehicles an integral part of its business strategy.

Lastly, we have some notable deals that caught our attention this week. Amber, a Bay Area startup that launched an aftermarket Tesla extended warranty product, raised $3.18 million in a seed round. Candela, the electric boat maker, secured $25 million in funding from investors including Groupe Beneteau, EQT Ventures, and others. And Pelikan Mobility, a French startup specializing in micromobility solutions, raised €2 million in a recent funding round.
