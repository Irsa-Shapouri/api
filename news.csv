Blizzard Entertainment
Overwatch 2 is leaning more into brand collaborations. After the Bastion Lego skin from the first game, the One-Punch Man tie-in earlier this year and the recent Diablo crossover, Blizzard has revealed the game’s first in-game music collab.
Fast-rising K-pop girl group Le Sserafim are coming to the game. The quintet is working with the Overwatch 2 team on the music video for upcoming single “Perfect Night.” The video will premiere on October 27 at midnight ET. Le Sserafim will also perform the song at BlizzCon’s closing ceremony on November 4.
That’s not all, though. A Le Sserafim-inspired custom game mode is on the way, along with related cosmetics — yes, including skins. We’ll learn more about all of that on October 30 and the collab will go live in Overwatch 2 on November 1.
MORE FROM FORBES So Far, 'Overwatch 2' Feels Like A Missed Opportunity For Crossover Skins
“We’re extremely excited to be working with Le Sserafim for our game’s first musical artist collaboration,” Overwatch general manager Walter Kong said. “Like the heroes of Overwatch, the Le Sserafim members are amazing as individuals, but unstoppable when they come together.”
For the uninitiated, Le Sserafim debuted last year and quickly rose to stardom. They’ve already found success in the U.S. The five members — Kim Chaewon, Sakura, Huh Yunjin, Kazuha and Hong Eunchae — saw their debut album Unforvigen reach number six on the Billboard Top 200 Albums chart earlier this year. The group also featured on Forbes’ 30 Under 30 Asia 2023 list in the Entertainment & Sports category.
I’ve been banging the drum for Overwatch 2 to have more crossover skins, and this is a cool if perhaps unexpected collaboration. I’ll admit, K-pop is a bit out of my wheelhouse, but Le Sserafim are clearly popular. They have several songs with more than a hundred million views and listens on both YouTube and Spotify.
As we’ve seen with Fortnite over the years, IP crossovers (especially for skins and other cosmetics) can help boost a game’s popularity. Time will tell whether the Le Sserafim tie-in works out for Overwatch 2. I’m immensely curious to see what those skins look like.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/10/18/to-get-ahead-insurance-companies-need-to-think-beyond-core-system-upgrades/,"To Get Ahead, Insurance Companies Need To Think Beyond Core System Upgrades","Amrish Singh is the founder and CEO of Liberate Innovations Inc.

Picture this: A company has an outdated core system, so its executives decide to upgrade it. After months of contract negotiations, they strike a (costly) deal for an upgrade, and the implementation process begins.
Flash forward to three years later—the implementation phase is still not over. Meanwhile, that core system, the latest technology at the time of purchase, is now outdated. Better technologies exist. But because the company’s leaders have already poured millions into this project, they don’t have the IT budget to change course. So they carry on, falling increasingly behind their competitors by the day.
This might seem like a far-fetched example, but it’s one that frequently happens at insurance companies (it occurs in other industries as well, but for the purpose of this article, I’m going to focus on insurance companies). It’s the Red Queen Effect in action: Companies take drastic steps only to remain where they currently are. The Red Queen Effect is a term you might recognize from Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking-Glass; the Red Queen tells Alice that “it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.” Insurance companies must avoid the Red Queen Effect to remain innovative and competitive.
Why Insurance Companies Can Get Pulled Into The Red Queen Effect
The insurance industry has traditionally taken longer to get on board with new technology. As McKinsey noted in a 2017 report, insurance “has been relatively slow to feel the digital effect owing to regulation, large in-force books, and the fact that newcomers seldom have the capital needed” to take on risks. Yet, as the consulting firm stressed, the industry “is not impregnable,” and companies that “fail to adapt will weaken under the pressure exerted by those that use digital technology.”
Understandably, some insurance executives might scramble to upgrade their core systems, fearing they’ll be left behind in light of technological advances, evolving customer expectations and seemingly ever-rising costs. On the surface, starting with a core system upgrade makes sense. It seems like the most logical first step; executives might think they must upgrade their baseline technology before continuing to innovate.
The Serious Consequences Of Falling Victim To The Red Queen Effect
However, in many cases, starting innovation efforts with a core system upgrade is not the most logical step an insurance company can take. It’s akin to someone redoing the foundation of their house so they can continue renovating the interior.
Insurance executives can fall into the line of thinking that innovation starts and ends with a core system upgrade because theirs is outdated—that’s the circular logic of the Red Queen Effect in action. But by focusing on the “foundation” of their technology, insurance executives risk missing the chance to innovate on a deeper level. Core system upgrades are a form of innovation, but they don’t tend to encompass the latest and greatest technologies that can help them streamline workflows, enhance customer journeys and more.
Moreover, core system upgrades are expensive. A figure from a 2020 McKinsey article reveals just how expensive a core system upgrade can be. The firm noted that for mid-cap banks, “multi-year modernization efforts” could “easily cost more than $100 million.” Insurance companies share similarities with mid-cap banks, and that price is something an insurance company could very well see for a core system upgrade. These upgrades also require a significant time commitment (from my observations, they can take years to complete) and often lock insurance companies into contracts. These constraints can further deter insurance leaders’ ability to innovate. By the time their companies’ core systems have been upgraded, new technology is on the market, and they’re unable to access that technology due to budget, time and, often, contractual constraints. Ironically, in their effort to innovate, they end up with the opposite: a hindered or non-existent ability to pursue further innovations.
Then there’s the issue of doing what competitors are doing. When many insurance companies decide to upgrade their core systems, they’re all essentially taking the same step—and not experimenting with fresh technology can put them ahead of the competition.
Steps Insurance Leaders Can Take Beyond Core System Upgrades
Despite the associated costs and time, insurance executives might still decide that pursuing a core system upgrade is the right choice. But before making a final decision, they should take a step back and think through their corporate goals, how well their existing technology can power those goals and what tech gaps they need to fill. Insurance executives don’t have to implement brand-new core systems to innovate. Instead, they can take three steps.
First, they should recognize the value of time. Technology moves fast; consider how quickly ChatGPT and other generative AI solutions became part of our lexicon. Insurance leaders should start pursuing tech projects that take weeks and months to successfully implement rather than years. Shorter implementation timeframes give greater leeway for course correction and directional changes later. They should also embrace the concept of bandages. If they think their technology is archaic, they can bandage it instead of replacing it altogether. By doing so, they can save time and money and put themselves in a position where they can more easily explore different innovations if they wish. Hand-in-hand with the concept of embracing bandages is adopting cutting-edge technology that addresses specific use cases, such as workflow optimization and automation. Collectively, these solutions can have a massive impact on an insurance company—without leaving its executives running in the same place.

Starfield sales were always going to be a question mark, given how many players would be able to play the game from day one on Xbox or PC Game Pass instead of buying it. But Starfield has performed strongly on Steam, and we have new data from the NPD (now Circana) that yes, it did sell well despite the Game Pass “giveaway.”
The full list (NPD via Windows Central) shows what its competition was in the top 10:
Starfield Mortal Kombat 1 EA Sports FC 24 Madden NFL 24 Payday 3 NBA 2K24 The Crew: Motorfest Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon Hogwarts Legacy Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2022)
So, a few things to note here. This is more impressive because this is an Xbox and PC exclusive, unlike these other games, cutting out the entire PlayStation playerbase. Plus, with around 30 million Game Pass subs at this point, that is a ton of people in the Xbox ecosystem who do not need to buy the game at all. So this entire figure is made up of people who bought it on Xbox outside of Game Pass or people who bought it on Steam, which was a sizable amount, given how high the concurrent player values have been there.
Starfield Bethesda
However, sure, you can go the other direction as well. This is a mainline Bethesda game, which is something we only get every five years or so, even though this is a new, untested IP. Also, this is the NPD where there are more Xbox sales in the US that across the rest of the planet, proportionally, so that could skew things here. Also, there was no hugely blockbuster competition in this month outside of mostly sports games and Mortal Kombat. The end of the list shows Hogwarts Legacy continuing its sleeper run as one of the most popular games of the year, despite being mostly forgotten about by many in the wake of so many other huge, high-scoring releases.
Starfield too was far from the highest scoring game of the year. There are dozens higher, and it’s on the low end of mainline Bethesda games. But it’s selling, and its playercount is high, that much is clear from this data, and others we can extract from places like Steam.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2023/10/18/british-auto-industry-urges-eu-tariff-delay/,British Auto Industry Urges EU Tariff Delay,"Cargo containers with European Union and British flags reflecting Brexit and restrictions in export ... [+] and import getty
Britons face an extra charge of an average £3,400 ($4,135) per electric vehicle if the European Union fails to postpone a 10% tariff due to start January 1.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, (SMMT) which represents U.K. automakers and suppliers, said EU buyers of British-made battery electric vehicles (BEVS) would face an average increase of £3,600.
This will happen if agreement on so-called “rules of origin” contained in the EU-U.K. Brexit deal aren’t delayed or cancelled.
Both sides are close to agreement on a 3-year delay, but EU members like France aren’t happy, even though failure to change the rules would hurt Renault of France, and Stellantis, through its huge Citroen and Peugeot subsidiaries. France is said to be unhappy that agreeing a delay would allow Britain to gain unfairly by thinking it could withdraw from the Single Market without paying a price.
The Brexit deal calls for BEVs to have 45% EU or U.K. content from 2024, with a 50 to 60% requirement for their battery cells and packs, or face U.K. or EU import tariffs of 10%. The problem is, that British and European supply chains for BEVs are not yet advanced enough for them to meet these rules.
Stellantis has said British plants will be shut down unless the Brexit deal is changed.
The SMMT said if an agreement is not reached on delaying or cancelling the tariff, the perverse outcome will be a gift to Chinese BEV makers, while it will also give a hidden subsidy to sales of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Sales of new ICE vehicles are in the process of being run down until they are eliminated in 2025.
SMMT CEO Mike Hawes said the U.K. and EU will be losers if the tariff plan is not delayed.
""Unnecessary, unworkable and ill-timed rules of origin will only set back the recovery and disincentivize the vehicles we want to sell. Not only would consumers be out of pocket, but the industrial competitiveness of the U.K. and continental (European) industries would be undermined. A three-year delay is a simple, common-sense solution which must be agreed urgently,” Hawes said in a statement.
The SMMT said if the rules are not delayed until 2027 both the EU and U.K. competitiveness, transition to BEVs and net zero ambitions will be jeopardized.
“With almost half (49.1%) of all new BEVs registered in the U.K. in the first half of the year coming from the EU, any cost increase would act as a barrier to uptake, undermining their competitiveness in an important and growing market. Furthermore, the application of a 10% tariff on electrified vehicles alone would undermine shared ambitions to be global leaders in zero emission mobility, holding back markets and undermining the drive to deliver net zero, given road transport remains the biggest contributor to overall carbon emissions,” the SMMT said in a statement.
“Conventional petrol and diesel vehicles would escape tariffs, meanwhile, which would have the perverse effect of incentivizing the purchase of fossil fuel-powered vehicles,” the SMMT said.
Britain’s automakers are also required to sell an increasing number of BEVs, starting with 22% of all new car sales in 2024, rising to 80% by 2030.

The European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) has said the rules could cost European automakers up to €4.3 billion in tariffs and lost output.
“Driving up consumer prices of European electric vehicles, at the very time when we need to fight for market share in the face of fierce international competition, is not the right move – neither from a business nor an environmental perspective,” said Luca de Meo, ACEA President and CEO of Renault in a recent statement.
“We will effectively be handing a chunk of the market to global manufacturers. Europe should be supporting its industry in the net-zero transition as other regions do – not hindering it. There is a very simple and straightforward solution: extend the current phase-in period for battery rules by three years. We urge the Commission to do the right thing,” de Meo said.

Not to be outdone by Sony’s Spider-Man 2 getting a 91 metascore just two days ago, Nintendo’s Super Mario Bros. Wonder has arrived with an eye-popping 93. Though perhaps not eye-popping if you’ve been paying attention to well, any big Mario game for decades.
But amazingly, because this is 2023, and one of the single best years for gaming…ever, this is not even the top-scoring game of the year. Here’s the breakdown of the score list that carves out remasters or games with just a couple reviews.
1. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – 96
2. Baldur’s Gate 3 – 96
3. Resident Evil 4 – 93
4. Super Mario Bros. Wonder – 93
5. Street Fighter 6 – 92
6. Sea of Stars – 91
7. Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 – 91
8. Diablo 4 – 90
9. Dave the Diver – 90
10. Rogue Legacy 2 – 90
93 Metacritic
And of course, other big games that didn’t get over that 90 bar, Final Fantasy XVI, Armored Core 6, Jedi: Survivor, Hi-Fi Rush, Starfield and more. But it’s not shocking that Super Mario Bros. Wonder did, even if it is shocking it did this the same year as Tears of the Kingdom. Of course, we also had this same thing happen with Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Bros. Odyssey.
What are critics saying about Wonder here? As you might expect there are loads and loads of 10/10s for Nintendo’s newest Mario offering. Some of those include:
VGC (10/10) – “Inventive and full of heart, with a tight design and striking presentation, Super Mario Bros. Wonder is undoubtedly the plumber’s most memorable 2D outing since the 1990s.”
GamesRadar (10/10) – “Move over Elephant Mario, the true star of Super Mario Bros. Wonder are the Wonder Flowers themselves, which continuously add the unexpected to an altogether brilliant 2D platformer. Okay, Elephant Mario's pretty amazing too.”
Metro (10/10) – “An endless cascade of ideas in a game that takes Mario to some wonderfully strange places.”
Does anyone disagree? There is a single review below an 8, Digital Spy’s 7/10:
“It is a game that tries to evoke a feeling of discovery at every possible turn, but in doing so loses the element of wonder fairly quickly. Instead, Wonder's strongest moments are when it takes a breather, taking the time to set the scene while letting the platforming do the talking.”
So, rather unshockingly, it’s another smash hit for Nintendo and will sell loads of copies with the Switch’s ever-expanding, enormous install base. Is this it? Is this the last super-game with scores this high releasing in 2023? A month and a half to go.

This story is part of a series on the current progression in Regenerative Medicine. This piece discusses advances in artificial intelligence technologies.
In 1999, I defined regenerative medicine as the collection of interventions that restore to normal function tissues and organs that have been damaged by disease, injured by trauma, or worn by time. I include a full spectrum of chemical, gene, and protein-based medicines, cell-based therapies, and biomechanical interventions that achieve that goal.
ChatGPT and similar chatbot-style artificial intelligence software may soon serve a critical frontline role in the healthcare industry. ChatGPT is a large language model using vast amounts of data to generate predictive text responses to user queries. Released on November 30, 2022, ChatGPT, or Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer, has become one of the fastest-growing consumer software applications, with hundreds of millions of global users. Some may be inclined to ask ChatGPT for medical advice instead of searching the internet for answers, which prompts the question of whether chatbox artificial intelligence is accurate and reliable for answering medical questions.
Dr. Rachel Goodman and colleagues at Vanderbilt University investigated chatbox responses in a recent study in Jama. Their study tested ChatGPT-3.5 and the updated GPT-4 using 284 physician-prompted questions to determine accuracy, completeness, and consistency over time. I will analyze their findings and present the pros and cons of incorporating artificial intelligence chatboxes into the healthcare industry.
Goodman and colleagues wanted to conduct a thorough investigation of ChatGPT. Their 284 questions were devised by 33 physicians across 17 specialties. Questions were varied between easy, medium, and hard, as well as a combination of multiple-choice, binary, and descriptive questions.
The accuracy scale ranged from one to six (one indicating completely incorrect and six indicating completely correct), and the completeness score ranged from one to three (one indicating an incomplete answer to the prompted questions and three indicating a comprehensive answer). Each score was determined by the physicians of that particular question’s field.
In the first round of testing with GPT-3.5, the researchers tabulated a median accuracy score of 5.0 and a median completeness score of 3.0, meaning on the first try, ChatGPT-3.5 typically answered the questions nearly accurately and comprehensively.
Of the 180 questions asked for GPT-3.5, 71 (39.4%) were completely accurate, and another 33 (18.3%) were nearly accurate. Roughly 8% of questions were completely incorrect, and most answers given an accuracy score of 2.0 or less were given to the most challenging questions. Most responses (53.3%) were comprehensive to the question, whereas only 12.2% were incomplete. The researchers note that accuracy and completeness correlated across difficulty and question type.
The 36 inaccurate answers receiving a score of 2.0 or lower on the accuracy scale were reevaluated 11 days later, using GPT-3.5 to evaluate improvement over time. Notably, 26 of the 26 answers improved in accuracy, with the median score for the group improving from 2.0 to 4.0.
To test and evaluate the accuracy and completeness of GPT-4 as compared to GPT-3.5, researchers asked both systems 44 questions regarding melanoma and immunotherapy guidelines. The mean score for accuracy improved from 5.2 to 5.7, while the mean score for completeness improved from 2.6 to 2.8, as medians for both systems were 6.0 and 3.0, respectively. These results suggest an improved answer generation for GPT-4, as expected.
To further cement their findings, the researchers asked the GPT-4 another 60 questions related to ten common medical conditions. Again, the resulting median accuracy was 6.0, and median completeness was 3.0. The mean scores were 5.7 and 2.8.
Among all 284 questions asked across the two chatbox platforms, the median accuracy score was 5.5, and the median completeness score was 3.0, suggesting the chatbox format is a potentially powerful tool given its prowess.
Many healthcare chatbots using artificial intelligence already exist in the healthcare industry. These include OneRemission, which helps cancer patients manage symptoms and side effects, and Ada Health, which assesses symptoms and creates personalized health information, among others.
ChatGPT and similar large language models would be the next big step for artificial intelligence incorporating into the healthcare industry. With hundreds of millions of users, people could easily find out how to treat their symptoms, how to contact a physician, and so on.
However, we must note the drawbacks of relying on such technologies before we proceed with their incorporation.
First is the question of privacy. There are ethical considerations to giving a computer program detailed medical information that could be hacked and stolen. Any healthcare entity using a chatbox system must ensure protective measures are in place for its patients.
Secondly, there will be cases of misinformation and misdiagnosis. While a median accuracy score of 5.5 is impressive, it still falls short of a perfect score across the board. The remaining inaccuracies could be detrimental to the patient's health, receiving false information about their potential condition.
Thirdly, while the chatbox systems have the potential to create efficient healthcare workplaces, we must be vigilant to ensure that credentialed people remain employed at these workplaces to maintain a human connection with patients. There will be a temptation to allow chatbox systems a greater workload than they have proved they deserve. Accredited physicians must remain the primary decision-makers in a patient’s medical journey.
Ultimately, however, the further advances of artificial intelligence are fascinating, and it will be interesting to see how large language models such as ChatGPT are implemented into all aspects of life, including the healthcare industry, in the near future.

When EE was first launched, its full title was Everything Everywhere—and its latest move seems to be aimed at living up to that name. The U.K. carrier has made a big announcement which positions it as a versatile and all-encompassing consumer brand. New EE will do a lot more than just sell you a cellphone.

First, there’s the broadband speeds which, from Friday October 20, will offer the fastest speeds ever seen in the U.K. at up to 1.6Gbps. Of course, you need access to full fiber in your street, which not all of the U.K.’s 32 million households have yet.
However, EE CEO Mark Allera said the rate of installation is increasing at a run rate of more than 3 million a year. Subscribers to this super-fast service, the price of which has yet to be announced, will also be able to add unlimited data SIM cards on 30-day subscriptions for $12 (£10) a month.
The company also announced its own new router, called the Smart Hub Plus which ensures wi-fi reaches every part of your home. There’s also something called Smart Hybrid Connect to make sure you’re always connected: if the landline connection goes offline, the system switches over to EE’s cellular network automatically.
Key to New EE is a platform which is open to “anyone and everyone – that will transform our customers’ experience beyond connectivity,” Allera said at the launch.
The new EE ID platform. EE
This works with an EE ID which offers access to a digital marketplace through a dedicated app and online, which will be open to everyone to access, whoever their internet provider is. EE is already a big seller of games consoles and now it will sell lots more electrical products. Gaming is a big part of the new offering, and that includes exclusive content, bundling of services, the option to spread payments and more. An EE Games Store open to everyone will follow.
The gaming commitment stretches as far as the broadband offering which will have settings for gaming or working from home, for instance. A WiFi Enhancer lets customers boost home connectivity, EE says, by prioritising online traffic accordingly in gaming or work mode.
Beyond this, the EE ID platform will over time add other products, such as security and insurance.
Customers of BT, part of the same company as EE and known for providing landlines and home broadband very widely, will be invited to move up to EE when they renew, though they will also be able to stay where they are if that’s what they prefer. EE will simply be the top-of-the-range offering.
Then there’s TV. EE has its own TV box for live programming from regular channels. There will be a new EE TV Box Pro in the coming months with streaming services accessible and a new EE remote.

President Joe Biden on Wednesday backed Israeli officials’ claim that an explosion that killed hundreds of people at a hospital in Gaza was not conducted by Israel’s military, after the Palestinian Health Ministry blamed Israel for the deadly airstrike and Israel claimed Palestinian rockets hit the hospital.

Key Facts
Biden told reporters on Wednesday that Defense Department data gave him confidence the explosion was not the result of an Israeli airstrike, and told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a visit to Israel that the strike appeared to have been launched by “the other team, not you.” In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces claimed the hospital was hit in a “failed shooting” by Gaza-based militant group Palestinian Islamic Jihad, during an “enemy rocket barrage” aimed at Israel that passed over the hospital at the time the facility was struck. Netanyahu also claimed the airstrike was the result of a failed rocket launch by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, citing “intelligence from multiple sources.” The Palestinian Health Ministry, meanwhile, alleges the hospital was hit by an Israeli airstrike, part of a dayslong bombing campaign in the Gaza Strip. Multiple outlets, citing the Health Ministry, put the number of casualties from the strike at 500—hospitals have been functioning as a refugee camp for displaced Palestinians for the past week.
Contra
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas—a Hamas rival who runs the Palestinian Authority, which controls the West Bank but not the Gaza Strip—canceled a planned trip with President Joe Biden in Jordan after the hospital explosion, the Associated Press reported. Biden was scheduled to meet with Abbas as part of a Middle East trip that also includes a visit to Israel.
Crucial Quote
“Immediately upon hearing this news, I spoke with King Abdullah II of Jordan, and Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel and have directed my national security team to continue gathering information about what exactly happened,” Biden said in a statement, adding the U.S. “stands unequivocally for the protection of civilian life during conflict.”
Key Background
The hospital explosion came amid an Israeli counter-offensive in the 10 days since Hamas launched an assault on Israel, killing more than 1,400 Israeli citizens and taking civilian hostages. Israel’s military last week gave more than one million residents of densely populated Gaza City 24 hours to evacuate to the Gaza Strip’s southern border, following Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s declaration of war against Hamas. Netanyahu says Israel’s mission in the war is to “destroy” the militant group that rules Gaza—the United Nations, however, cautioned such a swift evacuation would be “impossible” without “devastating humanitarian consequences.”
Tangent
The UN’s Palestinian refugee agency also warned on Tuesday that fuel reserves at Gaza hospitals are running precariously low, with just another 24 hours of energy from generators left, putting the “lives of thousands of patients at serious risk.” Gaza’s lone power plant had shut down late last week after Israeli officials cut energy—and food—to the territory as part of its “complete siege” on Gaza. Due to Israel’s blockade of Gaza, UN authorities also warned they would not be able to continue providing humanitarian aid into Gaza, though Israel reportedly agreed to let water and medicine into the territory through Egypt, following pleas from the U.S.
Chief Critic
Hamas’ attack—the deadliest on Israel in years, prompting a major retaliation from Israel’s military—has been widely condemned by Western officials, including Biden, who called the attack “horrific” and vowed to “stand ready to offer all appropriate means of support” to Israel.

One of the ideas at the heart of the discipline of supply chain management is the importance of collaboration. The discipline has done a good job of driving collaboration between sales and marketing and manufacturing, procurement, and logistics. The profession has not yet managed to integrate product development into core decisions in a meaningful way.
I attended the SAP Spend Connect Live conference in Vienna, Austria last week. This user conference focused on SAP’s spend management and business network solutions. Because procurement is a major theme of the conference, I could not help but talk to the top executives of this business unit about the new Elon Musk biography.
Musk Insists on Collaboration Between Product Design and Procurement
In the biography, the author - Walter Issacson - makes it clear – and this is a massive understatement – that Elon Musk is not like most other CEOs. Elon Musk is not just the CEO of Tesla, the market leader in electric cars and trucks, he is also the CEO of SpaceX. SpaceX designs, manufactures, and launches advanced rockets including Starship, the tallest and most powerful rocket in existence.
One thing that makes Musk distinctive is his hands-on approach to product design. Where other CEOs spend a large portion of their time on finance, marketing, and sales, Musk spends a much higher percentage of his time on product design and manufacturing.
Here is one excerpt from the book that highlights this theme. “Musk turned his attention to Raptor, the engine that would power Starship.” But Raptor would “have to be manufactured by the hundreds at reasonable cost… Raptor was too complex to be mass-manufactured… So in August 2021, Musk fired the person in charge of its design and personally took on the title of vice president for propulsion.” His goal was to get the cost of each engine to a tenth of what it then cost.
To lower costs Musk employs what he calls an “idiot index.” This is the ratio of the total cost of a component to its raw materials. “Something with a high idiot index – say a component that cost $1,000 when the aluminum that composed it cost only $100 – was likely to have a design that was too complex or a manufacturing process that was too inefficient.” Musk threatened to fire a financial analyst that did not know the idiot index numbers like the back of his hand.
The next day when that analyst met with Musk, he had the 20 parts with the highest idiot index scores listed on a slide. “It’s mainly the parts,” the analyst explained, “that require a lot of high-precision machining. We need to cut out as much of the machining as possible.” Musk smiled.
At both Tesla and SpaceX, Musk put the design engineers in charge of production. He said to the head of production design at SpaceX, for example, “you are responsible for the production process. You can’t hand it off to someone else. If the design is expensive to produce, you change the design.” The 75 design engineers then moved their desks next to the assembly lines to reinforce the idea that product design and manufacturing must work hand-in-hand.
SAP Spend Connect Live Links Procurement to ESG Goal Attainment
One of the themes that emerged from Spend Connect Live was the growing importance of the procurement function. One of the drivers of this is sustainability. As corporations announce plans to be Net Zero across their end-to-end supply chain at some point in the future – often 2050 – they then need their suppliers to participate in helping them meet their goals. And because procurement has a major role in selecting which suppliers a company will work with, companies that are serious about environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues will make sure ESG concerns are reflected in the supplier selection criteria.
This journey to integrate procurement more tightly into the ESG process is still early. Cost is still the most important driver of supplier selection. With high inflation rates around the world, cost is more important than ever in procurement decisions. But increasingly corporations are working with companies like EcoVadis to help accelerate their journeys to collect ESG data from suppliers and prospective suppliers.
According to EcoVadis, only 20% of suppliers in the EcoVadis network annually report on their emissions. Currently, a supplier looking to satisfy a customer usually goes through a labor-intensive project to collect and analyze their data. Many companies don’t even know how to start these projects. The work EcoVadis is doing is focused on not just getting data, but helping companies be able to get emissions data on an ongoing basis in a much less labor-intensive manner. EcoVadis is a solution partner to SAP, and the EcoVadis ESG data will be able to be pulled into SAP’s new Spend Control Tower if suppliers have calculated their emissions data. If the supplier does not know what their emissions are, artificial intelligence can be employed by the SAP Spend Control Tower solution to estimate the emissions. EcoVadis is also integrated with SAP Business Network, which enables suppliers to showcase their sustainability rating in their network profiles. Buyers can then search for suppliers based on these ratings.
Etosha Thurman, the chief marketing & solutions officer for SAP’s Intelligent Spend and Business Network business unit, made the point that for procurement to play a significant role in helping a company meet its ESG goals, procurement needs to be more tightly integrated with the product design function. “Once the specs are set, the ability for procurement to select lower emission suppliers is very limited. By contrast, when procurement teams are involved during the design phase, they can bring to light important sustainable sourcing information before it’s too late to make a difference.”
In short, where Elon Musk has focused on integrating product design with manufacturing and procurement, Ms. Thurman is pointing out the necessity of linking procurement more tightly with the product design and sustainability functions.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/652fea08ac298e95d5dcda68/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2023-10-18 10:24:33

Destiny 2 has started Festival of the Lost and as soon as it went live, players noticed that there was a new triumph full of question marks in order to acquire the first copy of the Lost Memento from the event, the new black-wrap shader that is so good, it’s causing a few controversies of its own. But more on that later.
Because this is the Destiny community, either through datamining or deduction, these objectives have been found already, and lord knows that you will never randomly figure these out on your own, so you should probably just listen to the instructions below.
Objective 1 – The mystery here is to complete the Fallen SABER strike with the Clovis Bray mask equipped, and yes, you can just launch it manually.
Objective 2 – The 100 here is 100/100 kills on Neomuna with the new Nimbus mask. This is probably the only one I can see you maybe figuring out randomly.
Objective 3 (these can be done in any order, by the way) – You need to perform 25 finishers in Legend Haunted Sectors while wearing the Tormentor mask. Clever.
Destiny 2 Bungie
This will get you your first copy of the Lost Memento, a Festival-only black memento that can be applied to crafted weapons like the Trials and Gambit and other ones before it. Many people thought Bungie forgot about these, but now it appears to be a way to get players to farm holiday events when they may not otherwise.
This is your first copy, but once you unlock this triumph by completing all the steps, you can then start to farm more of these as they are random drops from the event engrams. But apparently they are really, really rare drops, so you will have to go a bit crazy farming in order to actually acquire a bunch of these for your favorite weapons.
The memento system is weird. On the one hand, the shader effect is so good you will wish it was…an actual shader. On the other hand, grinding for at least something you want in Festival of the Lost that isn’t a bad new GL is mildly attractive. But the three week time limit? Yeah, that’s less fun, and I wonder if they’re going to be doing this with each event now.
The hidden challenge is cool, but yeah this whole process is bound to be pretty controversial as the event goes on. I’m out of town now, but yeah, I’ll be hunting for it when I get back.

Power transmission blackouts in Europe on continental and national scale. Credit: Joule/Stankovski et al.
Power grids—the web of electrical networks that sprawl across countries and continents—are under stress. Extreme weather events and volatile energy demands often push the system to the brink. Although these high-impact events can be very damaging, often overlooked is the impact of minor disruptions that trigger a domino effect throughout the system, according to a study analyzing European power blackouts.
The findings, published October 18 in the journal Joule, showed that recovering power within 13 hours can reduce up to 52% of the power loss stemming from cascading events.
""Imagine dominos when they are spaced far apart. Triggering it will not cause a chain reaction because it can't reach the next tile. We want the power system to operate in this relaxed way,"" says senior author Giovanni Sansavini of ETH Zurich, Switzerland. ""Triggering events like wind, storms, or hacking will always happen. But we can understand how our system operates and adjust the distance of the tiles to mitigate the risk of cascading events.""
Drawing on decades-worth of data from 478 blackout events across Europe and 14,557 incidents across Italy, the research team had three goals: pinpointing the cause of power failures, identifying the early warning signs, and improving power system recovery.
They found that cascading events are the leading causes of blackouts across the European continent, responsible for 91% of lost power and 89% of recovery time. While weather events, often damaging power lines, are the most common initiators of cascading events, events stemming from volatile grid conditions are the most damaging.
Human errors in operations, although rare, also have a very pronounced impact. The findings emphasize the importance of identifying early warning signs and operational training.
Teasing through the data from Italy, the researchers saw a pattern linked to blackouts. When the electrical demand reaches 80% of the power grid's maximum capacity and when wind speeds reach 50 km/h (31.1 mph), the occurrence of power failures spikes. If these indications can be verified as early warning signs, operators may develop strategies to mitigate the risk of power system failure.
""Early warning signs are less-expensive ways to build resiliency in the system,"" says Sansavini. ""Because upon detection, you can activate some buffers in the system.""
When a power failure does happen, less-significant events tend to take longer to fix because of the prioritization of high-impact ones. This prolonged duration weakens the system, rendering it vulnerable to further threats that can exacerbate the damage. However, the researchers found that restoring the power within 13 hours can cut the system's average exposure to cascades by 95%—avoiding up to 52% of cascading power loss. This suggests that 13 hours is the golden window for system operators to restore power.
Next, the researchers plan to construct a model based on their findings on cascading failures. This model will allow risk assessments of the power grid and scrutinize its vulnerabilities.
""We hope, via the model, we can simulate this chain reaction to understand how to stop it, like a hand in between the dominos tiles,"" says Sansavini. ""No system operator alone can win this battle; we need collaboration and system-wide assessments.""

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:
Researchers found that setting data centers at 41°C (105.8°F) can save up to 56% in cooling costs worldwide by relying on free-cooling, which uses ambient air to cool the water in air conditioning systems. Credit: Yingbo Zhang and Shengwei Wang
Colder is not always better for energy-hungry data centers, especially when it comes to their power bills. A new analysis says that keeping the centers at 41°C, or around 106°F, could save up to 56% in cooling costs worldwide. The study, published October 10 in the journal Cell Reports Physical Science, proposes new temperature guidelines that may help develop and manage more efficient data centers and IT servers in the future.
""The cooling system accounts for over one-third of the data center's total energy consumption, so many studies talk about reducing the energy consumption of cooling systems,"" says senior author Shengwei Wang of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. ""But rather than finding better ways to cool the data centers, why not redesign the servers to operate at higher temperatures?""
Data centers typically operate at temperatures between 20–25°C (68–77°F) today. The conventional cooling systems that maintain these centers work by pulling computer-generated hot air past water-chilled coils to cool down the air before it cycles back to the space. The heated water then enters either chillers or a process called free-cooling before circulating back to the coils. Unlike energy-intensive chillers that operate similarly to air conditioners, free-cooling uses ambient air to cool the water with much less energy use.
To save energy, data centers are often built in colder areas to leverage free-cooling. But thanks to advances in electronic technology, engineers and scientists know that it's no longer necessary to blast the chiller-based air conditioning at data centers. Many IT servers already allow a higher temperature operation above 30°C (86°F). This means that in most climates, including those that are hotter, data centers can also benefit from free-cooling by raising the temperature of data centers.
""The question is, to what temperature?"" says Wang. To find out, Wang and his team built a model based on the conventional cooling system and simulated the system's operation under different climate conditions. The results showed that data centers in almost all regions across climate zones could rely nearly 100% on free-cooling throughout the year when operated at 41°C, which they coined ""global free-cooling temperature."" These data centers could save 13%–56% of energy compared to those that run at 22°C (71.6°F).
Depending on an area's temperature and humidity, the researchers say that data centers might not even need to raise the temperature that far to take full advantage of free-cooling. For example, the temperatures for Beijing, Kunming, and Hong Kong to entirely rely on free-cooling are 39°C (102.2°F), 38°C (100.4°F), and 40°C (104°F), respectively.
""But before we raise the temperature settings, we need to ensure three things,"" says Wang. ""First, we need to ensure the reliability of server operation. Second, the computational efficiency needs to remain the same. Third, we need to ensure the servers' energy consumption is not increased by activating their built-in cooling protection, such as the fans."" That said, Wang is optimistic that it is possible for the next generation of servers to work at up to 40°C without performance degradation.
""For the first time we can provide cooling system engineers and server design engineers a concrete goal to work towards,"" says Wang. ""I think 41°C is achievable in the near future. We're only 10°C (18°F) or less away.""",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2023/how-to-build-greener-d.jpg,2023-10-18 11:00:02
https://techxplore.com/news/2023-10-potential-electricity-urban.html,Study predicts potential for 110% electricity increases in US urban buildings,"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

A research study led by University of Oklahoma assistant professor Chenghao Wang and published in the journal Nature Communications tackled the critical issue of how city-scale building energy consumption in urban environments will evolve under the influence of climate change.
Fossil fuels account for approximately 40% of all building energy use in urban city centers in the United States, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration reports that residential and commercial buildings in U.S. cities are one of the major energy consumers (39%) and greenhouse gas emitters (28%).
""Understanding their future energy use is very important for developing climate change mitigation strategies, improving energy efficiency, developing and implementing energy and environmental regulations, policies, and incentive plans and enhancing the resilience and adaptation of our society under future climate and extreme weather conditions,"" said Wang, who leads the Sustainable Urban Futures, or SURF, Lab in the OU School of Meteorology.
""Previous studies made strides in estimating how energy use might change at the national or state levels in response to future changes in climate,"" he said. ""However, there is a significant gap in our understanding when it comes to the city scale. As global cities commit to ambitious sustainability goals, a more granular understanding of energy use at the city scale becomes imperative.""
The research team includes Janet Reyna and Henry Horsey from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Jiyun Song, Dachuan Shi and Yuyu Zhou from the University of Hong Kong, Sarah Feron from the Universidad de Santiago de Chile, Zutao Ouyang and Robert Jackson from Stanford University, and Ying Li from China Three Gorges University.
They examined 277 cities across the contiguous U.S., using model simulations and the most recent future climate projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, or CMIP6, dataset. They considered four possible warming scenarios that encompass a variety of possible climate warming scenarios and two electric power sector scenarios.
""In one power sector scenario, we assumed no future carbon policies would be implemented, but we also included a scenario that assumes rapid decarbonization and net-zero carbon emissions from the power sector by 2050, similar to with U.S. carbon-pollution-free goals announced by President Biden in 2023,"" Wang said.
To investigate how urban building energy use would evolve under future climate change, Wang's team used an indicator called energy use intensity, or EUI. The EUI is the energy used per square foot per year and is calculated by dividing the total energy consumed by the buildings by their total gross floor area.
""Due to climate change, we found that city-scale building EUI is projected to experience uneven changes by the 2050s when compared to the 2010s,"" Wang said. ""The largest increase in electricity EUI will mainly occur in the South, Southwest, West, and Southeast, which will see an increase of up to 7.2%.""
They discovered that the increase in electricity EUI during warm seasons and the hottest days will be much greater than the annual change, especially in the Northwest. This difference is mainly due to the higher air conditioning adoption rate and space cooling energy use under future warming. For each degree of warming, the average city-level space cooling EUI will increase by 13.8%.
""We found an average 10.1 to 37.7% increase in the frequency of urban summer peak building electricity EUI. However, some cities will experience over 110% increases. This will require higher grid capacity and also greater resilience against power outages during extreme heat waves,"" Wang said.
The team also assessed the potential changes in the source energy used by urban buildings, considering energy losses during generation, transmission and distribution.
""Power sector decarbonization is very effective in curbing the source energy consumption of future buildings in cities, but it's crucial to further reduce direct fossil fuel combustion in buildings,"" Wang said. ""Simply put, we need rapid electrification for future urban buildings.""

Now that improvements in technology mean that some robots work alongside humans, there is evidence that those humans have learned to see them as team-mates—and teamwork can have negative as well as positive effects on people's performance.
People sometimes relax, letting their colleagues do the work instead. This is called ""social loafing,"" and it's common where people know their contribution won't be noticed or they've acclimatized to another team member's high performance. Scientists at the Technical University of Berlin investigated whether humans social loaf when they work with robots.
""Teamwork is a mixed blessing,"" said Dietlind Helene Cymek, first author of the study in Frontiers in Robotics and AI. ""Working together can motivate people to perform well but it can also lead to a loss of motivation because the individual contribution is not as visible. We were interested in whether we could also find such motivational effects when the team partner is a robot.""
A helping hand
The scientists tested their hypothesis using a simulated industrial defect-inspection task: looking at circuit boards for errors. The scientists provided images of circuit boards to 42 participants. The circuit boards were blurred, and the sharpened images could only be viewed by holding a mouse tool over them. This allowed the scientists to track participants' inspection of the board.
Half of the participants were told that they were working on circuit boards that had been inspected by a robot called Panda. Although these participants did not work directly with Panda, they had seen the robot and could hear it while they worked. After examining the boards for errors and marking them, all participants were asked to rate their own effort, how responsible for the task they felt, and how they performed.
Looking but not seeing
At first sight, it looked as if the presence of Panda had made no difference—there was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of time spent inspecting the circuit boards and the area searched. Participants in both groups rated their feelings of responsibility for the task, effort expended, and performance similarly.
But when the scientists looked more closely at participants' error rates, they realized that the participants working with Panda were catching fewer defects later in the task, when they'd already seen that Panda had successfully flagged many errors. This could reflect a ""looking but not seeing"" effect, where people get used to relying on something and engage with it less mentally. Although the participants thought they were paying an equivalent amount of attention, subconsciously they assumed that Panda hadn't missed any defects.
""It is easy to track where a person is looking, but much harder to tell whether that visual information is being sufficiently processed at a mental level,"" said Dr. Linda Onnasch, senior author of the study.
Safety at risk?
The authors warned that this could have safety implications. ""In our experiment, the subjects worked on the task for about 90 minutes, and we already found that fewer quality errors were detected when they worked in a team,"" said Onnasch.
""In longer shifts, when tasks are routine and the working environment offers little performance monitoring and feedback, the loss of motivation tends to be much greater. In manufacturing in general, but especially in safety-related areas where double checking is common, this can have a negative impact on work outcomes.""
The scientists pointed out that their test has some limitations. While participants were told they were in a team with the robot and shown its work, they did not work directly with Panda. Additionally, social loafing is hard to simulate in the laboratory because participants know they are being watched.
""The main limitation is the laboratory setting,"" Cymek explained. ""To find out how big the problem of loss of motivation is in human-robot interaction, we need to go into the field and test our assumptions in real work environments, with skilled workers who routinely do their work in teams with robots.""

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:
X, formerly known as Twitter, is testing an annual $1 fee for basic features as an anti-spam measure.
The social media site X, formerly known as Twitter, said Tuesday it has started charging new users in New Zealand and the Philippines for basic features such as posting messages in a trial aimed at reducing spam.
Tech billionaire Elon Musk, who bought Twitter last year for $44 billion, has long complained about fake accounts, bots and spam on the platform, introducing a number of controversial changes that have been sharply criticized by users around the world.
Under the trial, named ""Not A Bot"", new users in New Zealand and the Philippines will have to pay an annual fee for the ability to write on X, like and reply to posts, and bookmark content.
""This new program aims to defend against bots and spammers who attempt to manipulate the platform and disrupt the experience of other X users,"" the company said on its website.
""It is not a profit driver,"" it said in a separate post on X. ""So far, subscription options have proven to be the main solution that works at scale.""
It added that existing users will not be affected by the model, which will cost around $0.75 per year for new users in the Philippines and $0.85 for those in New Zealand.
Those who decline to pay will be able to access X in read-only mode, limited to viewing content and following accounts, the company said.
""Anything that a platform does to protect their users from the harm they might experience is a step in the right direction,"" said NetSafe, an independent online safety charity in New Zealand.
""Whether trying to stop bots from contacting people indirectly, that might engage in harmful conversations, or taking steps to verify who its users are... those things are potentially useful in trying to reduce harm.""
But Jonathan de Santos, chair of the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, said this would limit participation.
""We get that the program is meant to curb the use of bots, but this also seems like putting the burden of fighting misinformation and disinformation on users,"" he said.
Musk in September suggested charging all X users, saying it was the only way to combat the spam and bots that plague the platform.
But the idea was widely panned by users. Industry analysts said it would make X even less appealing to advertisers.
After taking over the company, the billionaire sacked thousands of staff and drew criticism for allowing banned conspiracy theorists and extremists back on the platform, sending advertisers fleeing.
Musk said in July that X had lost roughly half its ad revenue.
A month earlier, he had claimed that almost all advertisers had returned and that 90 percent of bots had been removed.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:
Chairman of Foxconn Technology Group Young Liu (R) and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Taiwanese announced Wednesday they are building 'AI factories'
Taiwanese tech giant Foxconn and US hardware leader Nvidia said Wednesday they would team up to create ""AI factories"", powerful data processing centers that would drive the manufacturing of next-generation products such as electric cars.
The world's largest contract electronics maker, Foxconn—officially known as Hon Hai Technology Group—already plays a lynchpin role in assembling gadgets for top global brands, including Apple's iPhone.
But it has ambitions to diversify beyond electronics assembly—even embracing the competitive but rapidly expanding electric vehicle business by unveiling concept cars on its ""Hon Hai Tech Day"" in past years.
This year, chairman Young Liu opened the annual event with Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang to introduce a ""new class of data centers powering a wide range of applications"".
Silicon Valley-based Nvidia made its name developing graphics processing units (GPUs), a powerful chip technology that started as the backbone of modern video games—but has now become a crucial pillar in the rapid development of generative AI.
""Together we will be helping the whole industry move much faster into the new AI era,"" Liu announced onstage with Huang.
The ""factories"" would include ""digitalization of manufacturing and inspection workflows, development of AI-powered electric vehicle and robotics platforms, and a growing number of language-based generative AI services"", according to Nvidia.
Huang said Foxconn ""has the expertise and scale to build AI factories globally"".
If successful, Foxconn's customers could use these systems to deliver generative AI services and use simulation to train autonomous machines like industrial robots and self-driving cars.
The announcement Wednesday came a day after the United States unveiled tightening curbs on exports of state-of-the-art chips to China—the latest move to prevent Beijing's advances in cutting-edge tech, seen by Washington as a national security threat.
The ban would hit Nvidia's chips that had previously gone to China—a major supplier base for many contract electronics manufacturers, including Foxconn—and sent the company's share price plummeting on Wall Street on Tuesday.
Nvidia said the new rules by the US Department of Commerce may ""require the company to transition certain operations out of one or more of the identified countries"".

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File photo
LONDON (Reuters) - A major cyber attack on a financial services payments system could lead to global losses of $3.5 trillion, with much of it not covered by insurance, commercial insurance market Lloyd’s of London said on Wednesday.
The United States would suffer losses of $1.1 trillion over a five-year period from such an attack, which would cause widespread disruption to global business, according to a systemic risk scenario developed by Lloyd’s and the Cambridge Centre for Risk Studies.
China would face $470 billion in losses and Japan $200 billion over the same period, Lloyd’s said.
“The global interconnectedness of cyber means it is too substantial a risk for one sector to face alone and therefore we must continue to share knowledge, expertise and innovative ideas across government, industry and the insurance market to ensure we build society’s resilience against the potential scale of this risk,” Lloyd’s chairman Bruce Carnegie-Brown said.
Cyber insurance saw over $9 billion in gross written premiums in 2022 and is forecast to grow to $13 billion to $25 billion by 2025, Lloyd’s said.
Concern about the cost of such insurance and whether it will provide cover in the case of war are deterring some potential customers, brokers say.
Over 20% of the world’s cyber premium is placed in the Lloyd’s market, Lloyd’s said.

https://www.reuters.com/innovation/article/ai-britain-summit/britain-aims-for-global-leadership-role-with-ai-safety-summit-idUSKBN31I0CB,Britain aims for global leadership role with AI safety summit,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will host the world’s first global artificial intelligence (AI) safety summit next month, aiming to carve out a role following Brexit as an arbiter between the United States, China, and the European Union in a growing tech sector.

The Nov. 1-2 summit will focus on the existential threat some lawmakers, including Britain’s Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, say AI poses. Sunak, who wants the UK to become a hub for AI safety, has said the technology could be used by criminals and terrorists to create weapons of mass destruction.
The EU, in contrast, has so far prioritised the technology’s implications for human rights and corporate transparency.
Sunak will host around 100 guests at Bletchley Park, the site in southern England where mathematician Alan Turing cracked Nazi Germany’s Enigma code.
U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis head a guest list that includes lawmakers, AI pioneers and academics.
The summit’s aim is to kickstart international dialogue on AI regulation, said Matt Clifford, a tech investor and one of its two chief organisers.
“It’s not a parliament,” Clifford said. “We’re not making laws. We’re not making treaties. We’re trying to bring different people into the conversation with very different opinions.”
The UK government’s agenda for the event, published this week, includes discussions on the unpredictable advances of the technology and the potential for humans to lose control of it.
But some analysts said the conference should not focus so specifically on existential threats. They say there are more pressing concerns.
“Most people I speak to are baffled that the UK has taken this approach,” said Stephanie Hare, author and leading researcher in technology ethics. “The question is: what are you going to do about it?”
NOISE
When Sunak first announced the summit in June, high profile figures had already warned of AI’s existential risks. Tesla mogul Elon Musk called for a pause in the development of such systems. Former Google researcher and “godfather of AI” Geoffrey Hinton said the technology posed a more urgent threat to humanity than climate change.
Critics question why Britain has appointed itself the centre of AI safety. But supporters say the summit will underline London’s position as a world-leading technology hub. According to Dealroom data published in December, British tech companies raised more capital in 2022 than those in France and Germany combined.
In the weeks after Sunak announced the summit, OpenAI said it would open its first office outside of the U.S. in London, while Google published an analysis suggesting further investment in AI would provide a 400 billion pounds ($488 billion) boost to Britain’s economy by 2030.
Marc Warner, CEO of London-based AI firm Faculty, who is attending the summit, said: “There’s three big poles in the world: the U.S., the EU, and China. If you’re going to try and do some kind of international collaboration, it’s not obvious that any one of those would let it be situated in the others.”
He added: “If you agree that London is the third most important AI city, behind San Francisco and Beijing, and that Britain is relatively neutral compared to the three big blocs, it’s a sensible proposition.”
The EU confirmed Vice President Vera Jourova had received an invitation to the event, but would not confirm her attendance.
“We are now reflecting on potential EU participation,” a spokesperson told Reuters.
At the time of writing, the two members of the European Parliament who led the drafting of the bloc’s AI Act, Brando Benifei and Dragos Tudorache, had not received invitations.
“It seems that this event’s focus on safety might be a different concept of safety from the AI Act, which has been centred around protecting fundamental rights,” Benifei said.
While the architects of AI regulation in Europe may not be present, the British government faced criticism over one potential attendee: China.
On Wednesday, the Financial Times reported China was expected to attend, citing sources in both the Chinese and British governments. The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Finance minister Jeremy Hunt defended the decision in an interview with Politico, saying: “If you’re trying to create structures that make AI something that overall is a net benefit to humanity, then you can’t just ignore the second-biggest economy in the world.”

The officials from the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - known as the Five Eyes intelligence sharing network - made the comments following meetings with private companies in the U.S. innovation hub Silicon Valley.
U.S. FBI Director Christopher Wray said the “unprecedented” joint call was meant to confront the “unprecedented threat” China poses to innovation across the world.
From quantum technology and robotics to biotechnology and artificial intelligence, China was stealing secrets in various sectors, the officials said.
“China has long targeted businesses with a web of techniques all at once: cyber intrusions, human intelligence operations, seemingly innocuous corporate investments and transactions,” Wray said. “Every strand of that web had become more brazen, and more dangerous.”
In response, Chinese government spokesman Liu Pengyu said the country was committed to intellectual property protection.
“We firmly oppose to the groundless allegations and smears towards China and hope the relevant parties can view China’s development objectively and fairly,” the spokesperson for China’s embassy in Washington said in a statement to Reuters.
The U.S. has long accused China of intellectual property theft and the issue has been a key sore point in U.S.-China relations. But this is the first time the Five Eyes members have joined publicly to call out China on it.
“The Chinese government is engaged in the most sustained scaled and sophisticated theft of intellectual property and expertise in human history,” said Mike Burgess, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation’s director-general.
While China’s intention to innovate for its own national interest was “fine and entirely appropriate”, Burgess said “the behaviour we’re talking about here goes well beyond traditional espionage.”
Last month, his department busted a Chinese plot to infiltrate a prestigious Australian research institution that involved planting an academic there to steal secrets, he said.
“This sort of thing is happening every day in Australia, as it is in the countries here,” Burgess said.
The Five Eyes statement follows the group’s warning in May of a widespread Chinese spy operation it said was targeting critical infrastructure and various other sectors.
The Chinese government dismissed those allegations as a “collective disinformation campaign.”
Wray said China had “a bigger hacking program than that of every other major nation combined” that together with Beijing’s physical spies and stealing of trade secrets from private businesses and research institutions gave the country enormous power.
“Part of what makes it so challenging is all of those tools deployed in tandem, at a scale the likes of which we’ve never seen,” Wray said.

The officials called for private industry and academia to help in countering those threats, chief among which they said were artificial intelligence tools.
“We worry about AI as an amplifier for all sorts of misconduct,” Wray said, accusing China of stealing more personal and corporate data than any other nation by orders of magnitude.
“If you think about what AI can do to help leverage that data to take what’s already the largest hacking program in the world by a country mile, and make it that much more effective - that’s what we’re worried about,” he said.",https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20231018&t=2&i=1648038297&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEJ9H03D,2023-10-18 02:54:03

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in July proposed raising Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) car requirements by 2% and by 4% for trucks and SUVs annually between 2027 and 2032. Tesla wants the agency to finalize rules increasing stringency for cars by 6% annually and 8% for trucks and SUVs, saying it would best “conserve energy and address climate change.”
The NHTSA’s proposal would result in a fleet-wide average fuel efficiency of 58 miles (93 km) per gallon by 2032.
Tesla’s position puts it sharply at odds with major automakers.
On Monday a group representing General Motors, Toyota Motor, Volkswagen and nearly all other major automakers sharply criticized NHTSA’s proposal, saying it is unreasonable and requested significant revisions.
The American Automotive Policy Council, a group representing the Detroit Three automakers, separately urged NHTSA to halve its proposed fuel economy increases to 2% annually for trucks, saying the proposal “would disproportionately impact the truck fleet.”
The group noted 83% of vehicles produced by Ford, GM and Chrysler parent Stellantis are trucks.
NHTSA said in response its rule “is focused on saving Americans money at the gas pump and strengthening American energy independence” and estimated the combined benefits of the proposal exceed costs by more than $18 billion.
The Alliance for Automotive Innovation said last month automakers would face more than $14 billion in non-compliance penalties between 2027 and 2032.
Toyota said on Tuesday the fines are “proof that there is insufficient technology to meet the proposed standards and that such standards have been set beyond maximum feasible.”U.S. automakers separately have warned the fines would cost GM $6.5 billion, Stellantis $3.1 billion and Ford $1 billion, citing NHTSA’s projections.
Automakers also raised alarm at the Energy Department’s proposal to significantly revise how it calculates the petroleum-equivalent fuel economy rating for EVs in NHTSA’s CAFE program, saying it would “devalue the fuel economy of electric vehicles by 72%.”",https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20231017&t=2&i=1648024929&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEJ9G0Q4,2023-10-17 23:44:34

ChatGPT, the generative AI chatbot that has taken the world by storm these past 12 months, has historically been limited to data up to September, 2021 — rendering it useless as a real-time search engine. However, OpenAI started bringing internet services to ChatGPT back in March, a move that always came with inherent risks, given that the live web isn’t curated in the same way a static training data set is — this potentially opened the doors to abuse by bad actors and good old-fashioned algorithmic chaos.
Then in May, OpenAI started rolling out web search via Bing, the search engine belonging to OpenAI’s corporate backer Microsoft, before extending access to the ChatGPT mobile app in late June. However, the new feature was swiftly pulled after it was discovered that ChatGPT was capable of displaying paywalled content.
Fast-forward to late September, and OpenAI started rolling the Browse with Bing feature out again, having fine-tuned how ChatGPT follows instructions laid out by content owners — essentially, it now promised to adhere to whatever a site-owner said in its Robots.txt file, similar to traditional web crawlers.
Now, Browse with Bing is officially available to all Plus and Enterprise subscribers, with no need to toggle their beta switch in settings.
In related news, OpenAI also transitioned DALL-E 3 into beta, a month after debuting the latest incarnation of the text-to-image generator.
DALL-E 3 sports integration with ChatGPT, meaning that users don’t have to think so carefully about their text-prompts when asking DALL-E to create an image — ChatGPT can do a lot of the heavylifting to ensure that the image the user gets, is closer to what they want.
But more than that, with DALL-E 3 embedded directly into ChatGPT, users will now be able to receive images as part of their text-based queries without having to switch between apps.
DALL-E 3 is available in beta now on the web and mobile, with users able to activate the feature by selecting “DALL-E 3 (Beta)” from the GPT-4 tab inside ChatGPT.
Vocal range
This all constitutes part of a broader expansion that is leading ChatGPT farther from a pure text-based generator, and down a path where audio and visuals are very much part of its remit.
Last month, OpenAI gave ChatGPT a mouth and ears with users able to have a verbal conversation with the chatbot, bringing together the worlds of Alexa-style voice assistants with powerful large language models (LLMs). For example, a user will be able to ask ChatGPT to create and narrate a bedtime story for their kid on the spot, though it’s maybe worth being on hand to see what it comes up with.
Additionally, ChatGPT will also allow users to search for answers using images, meaning that someone can upload a picture of an object and discover what it is or find similar items.
So today’s news very much fits into OpenAI’s push to make ChatGPT a fully integrated, real-time, multimedia generative search engine.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1647521480-e1694685235777.jpg?resize=1200,676",2023-10-18 10:32:40

https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/18/russia-sandworm-fancy-bear-china-winrar-zero-day/,Russia and China-backed hackers are exploiting WinRAR zero-day bug,"Google security researchers say they have found evidence that government-backed hackers linked to Russia and China are exploiting a since-patched vulnerability in WinRAR, the popular shareware archiving tool for Windows.
The WinRAR vulnerability, first discovered by cybersecurity company Group-IB earlier this year and tracked as CVE-2023-38831, allows attackers to hide malicious scripts in archive files that masquerade as seemingly innocuous images or text documents. Group-IB said the flaw was exploited as a zero-day — since the developer had zero time to fix the bug before it was exploited — as far back as April to compromise the devices of at least 130 traders.
Rarlab, which makes the archiving tool, released an updated version of WinRAR (version 6.23) on August 2 to patch the vulnerability.
Despite this, Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) said this week that its researchers have observed multiple government-backed hacking groups exploiting the security flaw, noting that “many users” who have not updated the app remain vulnerable. In research shared with TechCrunch ahead of its publication, TAG says it has observed multiple campaigns exploiting the WinRAR zero-day bug, which it has tied to state-backed hacking groups with links to Russia and China.
One of these groups includes a Russian military intelligence unit dubbed Sandworm, which is known for destructive cyberattacks, like the NotPetya ransomware attack it launched in 2017 that primarily hit computer systems in Ukraine and disrupted the country’s power grid.
TAG researchers observed Sandworm exploiting the WinRAR flaw in early September as part of a malicious email campaign that impersonated a Ukrainian drone warfare training school. The emails contained a link to a malicious archive file exploiting CVE-2023-38831, which when opened installed information-stealing malware on the victim’s machine and stole browser passwords
Separately, TAG says it observed another notorious Russia-backed hacking group, tracked as APT28 and commonly known as Fancy Bear, using the WinRAR zero-day to target users in Ukraine under the guise of an email campaign impersonating the Razumkov Centre, a public policy think tank in the country. Fancy Bear is best known for its hack-and-leak operation against the Democratic National Committee in 2016.
Google’s findings follow an earlier discovery by threat intelligence company Cluster25, which said last week that it had also observed Russian hackers exploiting the WinRAR vulnerability as a phishing campaign designed to harvest credentials from compromised systems. Cluster25 said it assessed with “low-to-mid confidence” that Fancy Bear was behind the campaign.
Google added that its researchers found evidence that the China-backed hacking group, known as APT40, which the U.S. government has previously linked to China’s Ministry of State Security, also abused the WinRAR zero-day flaw as part of a phishing campaign targeting users based in Papua New Guinea. These emails included a Dropbox link to an archive file containing the CVE-2023-38831 exploit.
TAG researchers warn that the ongoing exploitation of the WinRAR bug “highlights that exploits for known vulnerabilities can be highly effective” as attackers use slow patching rates to their advantage.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/windows-winrar.jpg?resize=1200,741",2023-10-18 15:01:46
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/18/meet-the-open-source-multimodal-models-rivaling-gpt-4v/,Meet two open source challengers to OpenAI's 'multimodal' GPT-4V,"OpenAI’s GPT-4V is being hailed as the next big thing in AI: a “multimodal” model that can understand both text and images. This has obvious utility, which is why a pair of open source projects have released similar models — but there’s also a dark side that they may have more trouble handling. Here’s how they stack up.
Multimodal models can do things that strictly text- or image-analyzing models can’t. For instance, GPT-4V could provide instructions that are easier to show than tell, like fixing a bicycle. And because multimodal models can not only identify what’s in an image but extrapolate and comprehend the contents (at least to a degree), they go beyond the obvious — for example, suggesting recipes that can be prepared using ingredients from a pictured fridge.
But multimodal models present new risks. OpenAI initially held back the release of GPT-4V, fearing that it could be used to identify people in images without their consent or knowledge.
Even now, GPT-4V — which is only available to subscribers of OpenAI’s ChatGPT Plus plan — has worrisome flaws, including an inability to recognize hate symbols and a tendency to discriminate against certain sexes, demographics and body types. And this is according to OpenAI itself!
Open options
Despite the risks, companies — and loose cohorts of independent developers — are forging ahead, releasing open source multimodal models that, while not as capable as GPT-4V, can accomplish many, if not most, of the same things.
Earlier this month, a team of researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Microsoft Research and Columbia University released Llava-1.5 (an acronym for “Large Language-and-Vision Assistant”), which, like GPT-4V, can answer questions about images given prompts like “What’s unusual about this picture?” and “What are the things I should be cautious about when I visit here?”
Llava-1.5 followed on the heels of Qwen-VL, a multimodal model open sourced by a team at Alibaba (and which Alibaba is licensing to companies with over 100 million monthly active users), and image-and-text-understanding models from Google including PaLI-X and PaLM-E. But Llava-1.5 is one of the first multimodal model that’s easy to get up and running on consumer-level hardware — a GPU with less than 8GB of VRAM.
Elsewhere, Adept, a startup building AI models that can navigate software and the web autonomously, open sourced a GPT-4V-like multimodal text-and-image model — but with a twist. Adept’s model understands “knowledge worker” data such as charts, graphs and screens, enabling it to manipulate — and reason over — this data.
Llava-1.5
Llava-1.5 is an improved version of Llava, which was released several months ago by a Microsoft-affiliated research team.
Like Llava, Llava-1.5 combines a component called a “visual encoder” and Vicuna, an open source chatbot based on Meta’s Llama model, to make sense of images and text and how they relate.
The research team behind the original Llava generated the model’s training data using the text-only versions of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and GPT-4. They provided ChatGPT and GPT-4 with image descriptions and metadata, prompting the models to create conversations, questions, answers and reasoning problems based on the image content.
The Llava-1.5 team took this a step further by scaling up the image resolution and adding data including from ShareGPT, a platform where users share conversations with ChatGPT, to the Llava training data set.
The larger of the two available Llava-1.5 models, which contains 13 billion parameters, can be trained in a day on eight Nvidia A100 GPUs, amounting to a few hundred dollars in server costs. (Parameters are the parts of a model learned from historical training data and essentially define the skill of the model on a problem, such as generating text.)
That’s not cheap, per se. But considering that it reportedly cost OpenAI tens of millions of dollars to train GPT-4, it’s definitely a step in the right direction. That is, if it performs well enough.
James Gallagher and Piotr Skalski, two software engineers at computer vision startup Roboflow, recently ran Llava-1.5 through its paces and detailed the results in a blog post.
First, they tested the model’s “zero-shot” object detection, or its ability to identify an object it wasn’t explicitly trained to recognize. They asked Llava-1.5 to detect a dog in an image, and, impressively, it managed to do this — even specifying the coordinates in the image where it “saw” the dog.
Gallagher and Skalski then moved on to a harder test: asking the model explain a meme. Memes aren’t always easy for models (or even people) to understand, given their double meanings, entendres, in-jokes and subtext. So they make for a useful benchmark of a multimodal model’s ability to contextualize and analyze.
Gallagher and Skalski fed Llava-1.5 an image of a person ironing clothes Photoshopped onto the back of a yellow taxi in a city. They asked Llava-1.5 “What is unusual about this image?,” to which the model responded with the answer: “ironing clothes on the back of a car in the middle of the street is both unconventional and potentially dangerous.” Tough to argue with that logic.
It’s in Gallagher’s and Skalski’s next few tests that Llava-1.5’s weaknesses began to show.
While they found the model could successfully figure out a coin’s denomination from an image of a single coin, Llava-1.5 struggled with pictures of multiple coins — suggesting that it can get lost in the details of “busier” images.
Llava-1.5 also couldn’t reliably recognize text, in contrast to GPT-4V. When Gallagher and Skalski gave Llava-1.5 a screenshot of text from a webpage, Llava-1.5 identified some of the text correctly but made several mistakes — and got stuck in a bizarre loop. GPT-4V had no such issues.
The poor text recognition performance might be good news, actually — depending on your perspective, at least. Programmer Simon Willison recently explored how GPT4-V can be “tricked” into bypassing its built-in anti-toxicity, anti-bias safety measures, or even solving CAPTCHAs, by being fed images containing text that include additional, malicious instructions.
Were Llava-1.5 to perform at the level of GPT4-V at text recognition, it’d potentially pose a greater security threat considering it’s available to use as developers see fit.
Well, mostly as developers see fit. As it was trained on data generated by ChatGPT, Llava-1.5 can’t technically be used for commercial purposes, according to ChatGPT’s terms of use, which prevent developers from using it to train competing commercial models. Whether that stops anyone remains to be seen.
On the earlier subject of safety measures, in my own quick test, it quickly became apparent that Llava-1.5 isn’t bound by the same toxicity filters as GPT-4V.
Asked to give advice to a pictured larger women, Llava-1.5 suggested that the woman should “manage [her] weight” and “improve [her] physical health.” GPT-4V outright refused to answer.
Adept
With its first open source multimodal model, Fuyu-8B, Adept isn’t trying to compete with Llava-1.5. Like Llava-1.5, the model isn’t licensed for commercial use; that’s because some of its training data was licensed to Adept under similarly restrictive terms, according to Adept CEO David Luan.
Instead, with Fuyu-8B, Adept aims to telegraph what it’s been working on in-house while soliciting feedback (and bug reports) from the developer community.
“Adept is building a universal copilot for knowledge workers — a system where knowledge workers can teach Adept a computer task just like how they’d onboard a teammate, and have Adept perform it for them,” Luan told TechCrunch via email. “We’ve been training a series of in-house multimodal models optimized for being useful for solving these problems, [and we] realized along the way that we had something that would be pretty useful for the external open-source community, so we decided that we’d show that it remains pretty good at the academic benchmarks and make it public so that the community can build on top of it for all manner of use cases.”
Fuyu-8B is an earlier and smaller version of one of the startup’s internal multimodal models. Weighing in at 8 billion parameters, Fuyu-8B performs well on standard image understanding benchmarks, has a simple architecture and training procedure and answers questions quickly (in around 130 milliseconds on 8 A100 GPUs), Adept claims.
But what’s unique about the model is its ability to understand unstructured data, Luan says. Unlike Llava-1.5, Fuyu-8B can locate very specific elements on a screen when instructed to do so, extract relevant details from a software’s UI and answer multiple-choice questions about charts and diagrams.
Or rather, it can theoretically. Fuyu-8B doesn’t come with these capabilities built in. Adept fine-tuned larger, more sophisticated versions of Fuyu-8B to perform document- and software-understanding tasks for its internal products.
“Our model is oriented towards knowledge worker data, such as websites, interfaces, screens, charts, diagrams and so on, plus general natural photographs,” Luan said. “We’re excited to release a good open-source multimodal model before models like GPT-4V and Gemini are even publicly available.”
I asked Luan whether he was concerned that Fuyu-8B might be abused, given the creative ways that even GPT-4V, gated behind an API and safety filters, has been exploited to date. He argued that the model’s small size should make it less likely to cause “serious downstream risks,” but admitted that Adept hasn’t tested it on use cases like CAPTCHA extraction.
“The model we are releasing is a ‘base’ model — AKA, it hasn’t been fine-tuned to include moderation mechanisms or prompt injection guardrails,” Luan said. “Since multimodal models have such a wide range of use cases, these mechanisms should be specific to the particular use case to ensure that the model does what the developer intends.”
Is that the wisest choice? I’m not so sure. If Fuyu-8B contains some of the same flaws present in GPT-4V, it doesn’t bode well for the applications developers build on top of it. Beyond biases, GPT-4V gives the wrong answers for questions it previously answered correctly, misidentifies dangerous substances and, like its text-only counterpart, makes up “facts.”
But Adept — like an increasing number of developers, seemingly — is erring on the side of open sourcing multimodal models sans restrictions, damn the consequences.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ai-gen-unfiltered.jpg?resize=1200,675",2023-10-18 15:00:27
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/18/nvidia-brings-generative-ai-compatibility-to-robotics-platforms/,Nvidia brings generative AI compatibility to robotics platforms,"It likely won’t surprise you to learn that generative AI has been a white-hot topic in the world of robotics. There are a number of different ideas floating around about the best ways to embrace the emerging technologies, from natural language commands to design. I put the question of generative AI to Deepu Talla, Nvidia’s vice president and general manager of Embedded & Edge Computing, during a recent visit to the company’s South Bay headquarters.
“I think it speaks in the results. You can already see the productivity improvement,” the executive told me. “It can compose an email for me. It’s not exactly right, but I don’t have to start from zero. It’s giving me 70%. There are obvious things you can already see that are definitely a step function better than how things were before. Summarizing something’s not perfect. I’m not going to let it read and summarize for me. So, you can already see some signs of productivity improvements.”
Turns out Nvidia was only a couple of weeks away from announcing its news pertaining to the topic. The ROSCon announcement comes alongside several other bits of news connected to its various robotics offerings, including the general availability of the Nvidia Isaac ROS 2.0 and Nvidia Isaac Sim 2023 platforms.
The systems are embracing generative AI, which should go a ways toward accelerating its adoption among roboticists. After all, as Nvidia notes, some 1.2 million developers have interfaced with the Nvidia AI and Jetson platforms. That includes some big-name clients like AWS, Cisco and John Deere.
One of the more interesting bits here is the Generative AI Playground for Jetson, which gives developers access to open source large language models. The company writes:
The NVIDIA Jetson Generative AI Playground provides developers access to optimized tools and tutorials for deploying open-source LLMs, diffusion models to generate stunning images interactively, vision language models (VLMs) and vision transformers (ViTs) that combine vision AI and natural language processing to provide comprehensive understanding of the scene.
The arrival of these sorts of models can go a ways toward helping systems determine a course of action in circumstances they weren’t already trained on (on its own, simulation only goes so far). After all, while spots like warehouses and factory floors are more structured than, say, a freeway, there are still innumerable variables to contend with. The idea is to both be able to adjust on the fly and offer a more natural language interface for the systems.
“Generative AI will significantly accelerate deployments of AI at the edge with better generalization, ease of use and higher accuracy than previously possible,” Talla said in a statement tied to today’s news. “This largest-ever software expansion of our Metropolis and Isaac frameworks on Jetson, combined with the power of transformer models and generative AI, addresses this need.”
The latest versions of the platforms also bring improvements to perception and simulation.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Image-NVIDIA-Jetson-Platform-Expansion.jpg?resize=1200,675",2023-10-18 15:00:09

The first initiative is an immersive watch page experience for news stories, while the second is the launch of the Shorts Innovation Program for News.
In a blog post, YouTube shared that the news watch page will showcase content from news sources across video on demand, live streams, podcasts and Shorts. The idea behind the new page is allow users to explore multiple sources across long-form video, live coverage and short-form video.
You can open the watch page for a specific news topic by clicking on a video with the newspaper icon on the YouTube homepage or in search results. The new watch page is rolling out over time on mobile in around 40 countries. YouTube plans to launch desktop and TV versions of the feature in the future. The Google-owned company says it “believes this updated news experience will help viewers access a range of credible and diverse voices when they want to dive into a news topic.”
As for the Shorts Innovation Program for News, Youtube is looking to help news organizations create short-form video content through financial grants and support. To start, YouTube is working with more than 30 organizations across 10 countries and providing them with a total of $1.6 million to fund their efforts.
“Participants are selected based on having a strong existing long-form video presence on YouTube, but are looking to improve and expand their Shorts news content creation,” the company wrote in the blog post. “Over the next year, YouTube specialists will work with news organizations, including Univision in the U.S., AFP in France, and Mediacorp in Singapore on Shorts content strategy and video production best practices.”
YouTube says the goal of the program is to help news publishers who are interested in developing short-form content, but don’t have the resources to do so.
A lot of news organizations have fully embraced TikTok, so it makes sense for YouTube to try to expand Shorts news content on its platform to compete, especially by bringing on publishers who have yet to delve into short-form video.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/youtube-ios-app.webp?w=1024,2023-10-18 14:47:35

A few months after TikTok teamed up with Redbox to feature content on over 3,000 kiosks, the short-form video app is partnering with more companies to expand its advertising opportunities for brands.
The company is calling the program “Out of Phone” and will bring existing campaigns to billboards, movie screens and venues like bars, restaurants, airports, gas stations and retail stores.
New partners include VEVO, the popular music video network; ReachTV, the major in-airport television network; Loop TV, a free streaming TV service for businesses; Raydiant, a brick-and-mortar experience platform; GSTV, a gas station ad company; Screenvision, a cinema advertising company; and billboard companies DIVE Billboards and Adomni.

Advertising is a huge revenue stream for TikTok, and its new out-of-home solution will allow companies to amplify their campaigns to a much wider audience given that they’ll exist on billions of screens worldwide.
“With Out of Phone, we’re taking TikTok beyond the palm of our hands and into everyday life,” Dan Page, global head of distribution at TikTok, said in a statement.
The new announcement comes on the heels of Disney striking a deal with TikTok to become one of its publishing partners for TikTok’s premium ad product, Pulse Premiere, which will provide a brand-safe ad slot within the social video platform.
The company was also recently spotted testing an ad-free subscription tier for users that will reportedly cost $4.99 per month.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1248389907.jpg?resize=1200,675",2023-10-18 14:17:55

Hello, and welcome back to Equity, the podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.
This is our Wednesday show, where we sit down with a guest, talk about their work and dive deep into the rest. This week Gené Teare from Crunchbase and Crunchbase News joined the podcast. She’s a well-known analyst of the global venture capital market, and was instrumental to Crunchbase’s early life and remains one of its more tenured staffers.
So, what did the three of us get into? Here’s the rundown:
The big picture: What should we think about when we consider the Q3 2023 venture capital market as a whole. (More on Latin America here, Canada here, and global data here from TechCrunch+.) Here’s Gené on Q3 data as well.
Stage-level health. Which level of startup maturity is seeing the most capital? The least?
And, venture capital flows around the world. As always, where venture dollars land is nearly as important as their total number for any particular period.
Equity is back on Friday with our weekly news roundup. Chat then!
Before we let you go, some disclosures: We invited Gené on the show because we wanted to pick her brain regarding the venture capital markets. We knew she’d be great on the topic, because both Mary Ann and Alex worked with her for years at Crunchbase. During their tenure at Crunchbase, this podcast’s cohosts were paid partially in stock options, and retain minor stakes in the startup itself. We do our best at Equity to cite the best data source for whatever topic we’re looking at, which means we use Crunchbase data as well as information from its competitors at PitchBook and CB Insights; indeed, we had a PitchBook denizen on the show to chat through Q2 2023 results just a few months back. All that’s to say that we think we put together the best possible show for you on its merits alone, but did want to note some professional overlaps right up top.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/robot-arm-money-1.jpg?resize=1200,645",2023-10-18 14:05:14
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/18/new-york-vc-firms-form-alliance-to-back-diversity/,New York VC firms form alliance to back diversity,"Despite what numbers might show, some venture capitalists are quite serious in their commitment toward diversity, equity, and inclusion are not going away.
The New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC) on Wednesday announced the launch of Venture Access Alliance, a group of 70 investors who have promised to boost diversity in the Big Apple’s startup ecosystem. It is part of the city’s Venture Access NYC initiative, which also provides fellowships and a career program for diverse talent looking to enter venture capital.
New York City is the second largest tech ecosystem in the world, making such a public-private partnership significant in the impact it could have. The Alliance encourages firms and investors to collect diversity data and increase the number of women and minorities hired and funded annually. From there, the Alliance hopes to track the progress of the city’s landscape and ask investors to fund and implement programs that can help develop diverse talent in the city.
Harlem Capital Partner Jarrid Tingle and Union Square Ventures Partner Fred Wilson chair the Alliance in partnership with the Ford Foundation, Annenberg Foundation and Tech:NYC. The Alliance was created to ensure that New York City was tapping into the next generation of talent, Tingle told TechCrunch.
“Creating an inclusive ecosystem is the right thing to do, but it also ensures that NYC is not leaving GDP and innovation on the table,” Tingle said.
Today, the NYCEDC released its latest diversity in venture capital report and cited data from Kauffman Fellows Research Center that found diverse founding teams have higher investor returns compared to founding teams that are all white. The report also highlighted data from Cambridge Associates, which found that new and emerging fund managers are constantly at the top of the asset class.
“The Alliance is putting a stake in the ground [saying] that we want to do more, we want to do better, and that means driving more investment to diverse founders, it means hiring more diverse staffers, it means mentoring, that means internships,” NYCEDC’s President & CEO Andrew Kimball said. “We’re very excited.”
Other firms have signed on, including Citi Impact Fund, M13, Streetlife Ventures and Primary VC. The Alliance is still in the early stages; members hope to start working together in the next few months. It builds on Mayor Eric Adam’s economic recovery plan, which focuses on helping underserved entrepreneurs have greater access to capital. Its mission is essential given the fact that almost 30% of businesses in New York City are minority-owned, with Black-owned businesses in particular seeing a dramatic increase.
“It’s clear that diverse founders consistently outperform, and we have an opportunity in New York City to harness our unmatched diversity to build the most robust and inclusive innovation hub in the world,” Kimball continued.
The NYCEDC’s work is essential and timely, given the backlash to DEI brewing in the ecosystem. California SB 54, which Gov. Gavin Newsom signed last week, requires firms operating in the state to report the diversity breakdown of who they back. As debates ensue on the role of policy in increasing diversity in venture capital, private organizations have taken to helping increase diversity on their own terms. The Venture Alliance takes inspiration from the PledgeLA, which was launched by the Annenberg Foundation and the City of Los Angeles.
Local efforts like this matter, Kimball said, and he sees hope for an organization like this throughout the nation. “We feel like we can hopefully turbocharge the effort by having it open in New York,” he said. “We’d love to see it expand beyond the five boroughs.”","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1455881718-e1697626384284.jpg?resize=1200,699",2023-10-18 14:00:41
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/18/youtubes-latest-features-aim-to-help-creators-make-more-money-from-shoppable-videos/,YouTube's latest features aim to help creators make more money from shoppable videos,"Only weeks after TikTok Shop’s entry into the U.S. market, YouTube today is making it easier for consumers to shop products presented by its own creator community. The company is introducing new creator-focused features that will allow them to add timestamps to videos for their tagged products and tag their affiliate products in bulk across their video library. Combined, the additions will simplify the process of marketing products through YouTube videos and potentially increase sales, netting creators more money.
YouTube has been steadily rolling out more tools for shopping from its videos for many months, having last year partnered with Shopify to allow merchants to feature their products in videos, expanded livestream shopping features, and added shopping features to YouTube Shorts, among other efforts.
Now it’s experimenting with more ways to connect consumers to products creators are showcasing in their videos with the new releases. With the timestamps feature, creators will be able to make the shopping button appear at the relevant points in their video — like when they’re showing off a favorite gadget or beauty product, for example. YouTube tested the feature in the U.S. last month and found that people who saw these timestamps clicked on tagged products twice as often. The feature is only available on long-form content, not Shorts, however. And video must be at least a minute long with a maximum of 30 seconds in between timestamps, YouTube says.
The company is also adding new tools to tag affiliate products across the creator’s video library in bulk, based on products added to the video’s description. To use this feature, creators will access the Shopping tab in YouTube Studio to see a list of their videos with products mentioned in the description. From there, they can click the videos they want to tag, make adjustments, then click “Save” to complete the process. The feature will allow creators to quickly monetize videos from their back catalog that are still seeing high views with little effort, the company notes.
Though not available today, YouTube is also teasing new insights and analytics for affiliate products that will allow creators to see things like sales metrics, orders, offer clicks and impressions from Studio’s “Analytics” tab under “Revenue” then “Affiliate program.”
The changes come as TikTok is ramping up its own e-commerce features in the U.S., which include a dedicated shop tab on the home screen, live video shopping, shoppable ads and affiliate programs for creators.
Though a number of video shopping efforts are stalling in the U.S., with some startups failing to gain traction, other efforts are just taking off. For instance, TalkShopLive just launched a new app this week to allow sellers to broadcast on its platform, digital sports and apparel platform Fanatics just launched a live commerce app, a former Amazon exec launched a video shopping app for beauty items Trendio, and Elon Muks’s X is planning to experiment with live shopping in a partnership with Paris Hilton’s 11:11 Media company as part of a broader 2-year deal. Even Apple is embracing live shopping to some extent with a new experience launched earlier this year that connects online shoppers to live Apple sales reps to answer their questions.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/youtube-ios-app.webp?w=1024,2023-10-18 13:46:16
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/18/revroad-capital-raises-61-million-for-early-stage-startups-in-utah-and-beyond/,RevRoad Capital raises $61 million for early-stage startups in Utah and beyond,"RevRoad was started in 2017 as a venture services firm for startups in Utah. The organization offered a two-year program with access to 12 resources ranging from legal services to sales help to mentorship in exchange for equity. But unlike many entities, it didn’t have capital to invest in the startups that completed the program. Now it has a solution for that.
RevRoad Capital raised $61 million for its debut fund to focus on early-stage investments, mainly at seed. The Provo, Utah-based fund will operate as a sister organization to RevRoad and will invest the majority of its capital into companies that went through RevRoad’s program. It will also make investments in select other startups as well.
David Mann has been working with RevRoad since 2018 when he got involved after he left his job as the director of Amazon Game Studio. When RevRoad began to formulate the idea of launching a venture fund back in 2022, Mann knew he wanted to be a part of it and signed on as the fund’s executive managing director.
“I decided to un-retire and lead this fund and really try to shape it in a way that fulfills the vision of RevRoad and helps founders get hard dollars and also great support from their venture partners as they scale,” Mann told TechCrunch.
While the timing made sense for RevRoad, the market conditions weren’t ideal. The past year has been one of toughest periods for fundraising — especially for emerging managers. First-time funds are on track to close the smallest amount of funds — and raise the lowest amount of capital — in 2023 compared to the last decade, according to Q3 data from PitchBook.
Managing director Rachelle Morris told TechCrunch that they weren’t immune to the market pressures. “We definitely felt the headwinds,” Morris said. “There were a lot of folks who told us, ‘Wow, we love your thesis and we love the team, we just don’t have liquidity right now.’”
But they did find particular success with a specific group of LPs: women operators, which in Utah were largely an untapped resource. When Morris started the fundraising process, she reached out to a longtime acquaintance and local business leader and was shocked to find out she’d never been asked to invest before.
“You would expect that if there is any woman in the Utah community who would have been shown deals in funds, she would have been one of those 20 women,” Morris said. “That’s where we gained confidence of, ‘Huh, women are being underestimated as investors.'”
She was right. These local women operators ended up making up 30% of the fund’s LP base.
Mann said he also thinks their strategy helped them in a tougher fundraising environment. The majority of RevRoad Capital’s investments are built off of existing relationships with startups from RevRoad, which means the firm already has two years of data and diligence on a startup before it gets a check. He thinks that makes the firm look less risky in LP’s eyes.
Because RevRoad’s headquarters are in Utah, Mann said the majority of the portfolio companies for Fund I will be in Utah, but as RevRoad continues to expand into other geographies, RevRoad Capital will as well. But the current focus isn’t limiting, because Utah is a great place for startups, he said: There is a good startup culture and the local government has made it so there are few barriers for startups to launch.
The fund will invest as a generalist but with a stronger focus in areas, including electric vehicles, AI, SaaS, retail and manufacturing. The firm’s portfolio companies will still get access to many of RevRoad’s startup services regardless of whether they went through the program initially.
“Once a company is in RevRoad LLC or RevRoad Capital, they are a RevRoad company,” Mann said. “We pull that expertise in where needed. RevRoad is happy to help RevRoad Capital companies. They can have an impact.”","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/01_L-R-Scott-Petersen-Rachelle-Morris-David-Mann-Bart-Skalla.jpg?resize=1200,800",2023-10-18 13:05:16
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/18/statement-a-cash-flow-management-platform-for-enterprises-raises-12m/,"Statement, a cash flow management platform for enterprises, raises $12M","Statement, a startup developing a platform for enterprise cash flow management, today announced that it raised $12 million in seed funding.
Glilot Capital Partners contributed to the tranche with participation from Citi, Mensch Capital Partners, Titan Capital and Operator Partners. Co-founder and CEO Idan Vlodinger says that it’ll be used to “double down” on Statement’s go-to-market efforts and “accelerate” the pace of product development.
“Many traditional finance and treasury operations are manual, time-consuming and complex,” Vlodinger told TechCrunch in an email interview. “Tasks like monitoring all of the company’s cash in real time across all legal entities, regions and financial institutions are extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming. Finance and treasury teams are ultimately in charge of their company’s financial health and bear the weight of the world on their shoulders, but they don’t have access to the information needed to make timely, mission-critical decisions.”
Before founding Statement, Vlodinger worked at Amazon, where he was a senior product manager at Prime Video. After leaving Amazon for Mastercard, where he eventually graduated to the role of VP of products and innovation, Vlodinger teamed up with Shahar Lahav, a former researcher in the Israel Defense Forces, to launch Statement.
Vlodinger describes Statement as a “cash intelligence” platform for companies working with multiple banks, managing liquidity and attempting to forecast their cash flow. Statement connects with banks and integrates with existing systems, including business tools (e.g. Google Sheets), enterprise resource management platforms (e.g. Oracle Cloud, NetSuite) and payment providers (e.g. PayPal, Stripe), to reconcile and sync real-time financial data to give visibility into a firm’s cash performance, Vlodinger says.
Statement can automatically categorize transactions for financial reports. And it can forecast short- and long-term cash flow, establishing a baseline and analyzing historical trends to improve overall forecast accuracy. Elsewhere, Statement’s workflow automation tools allow teams to automate repetitive and manual tasks like cross-checking between banks and reporting errors.
“Statement saves the office of the CFO hundreds of hours per month on manual data collection and enrichment, and hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars by being able to manage their money faster and better,” Vlodinger said. “CFOs deserve to work with great software, with a fantastic user interface, that has real-time data, and have the systems “speak” to each other with true data reconciliation, so they can focus on growing their businesses.”
Vlodinger claims that Statement, founded in 2022, already has dozens of companies in its customer roster. Revenue has increased 10x over the past year, meanwhile — despite competition from vendors like Kyriba, Trovata, Ion and Gtreasury.
Gearing up for further growth, Statement plans to expand its 31-person team, which is split between offices in New York and Tel Aviv, to 35 people by the end of next year.
“The pandemic, supply chain risk, volatile markets, rising interest rates and high inflation have caused global enterprises’ management to be laser-focused on their finances and cash. The technology stack for the office of the CFO has emerged as a key component in this landscape. As a result, it now represents one of the most exciting opportunities and areas for development and innovation.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/64775edd75800e25ab18f3e9_Newinfinityv5-1-min.jpg,2023-10-18 13:00:49
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/18/whisper-aero-unveils-ultra-quiet-electric-leaf-blower-powered-by-aerospace-tech/,"Whisper Aero unveils ultra-quiet electric leaf blower, powered by aerospace tech","Whisper Aero emerged from stealth a little over two years ago with a straightforward (if ambitious) plan: to radically reduce noise emissions from next-gen aircraft with a never-been-done-before electric thruster.
But according to Whisper COO Ian Villa, from the very beginning, the company was thinking more expansively. The startup was founded by Villa and CEO Mark Moore, both former executives at Uber’s aerial ridesharing project Elevate. Early on, the two founders had a hunch that the electric propulsor could be scaled down for products outside the aviation industry.
Like, say, lawn care.
“If we showed you our seed round deck, we had a leaf blower in it,” Villa said in a recent interview. “We’ve always known leaf blowers would be on the path. The real question was when.”
The answer to that question is now. Today, Whisper has unveiled “Whisper Drive,” a scaled-down electric ducted fan that can be integrated into leaf blowers, commercial drones or other consumer products. The company says that a Whisper Drive-enabled leaf blower can be up to forty times quieter at fifty feet than its competitors, effectively turning a neighborhood nuisance into a barely perceptible hush.
The result is a leaf blower that emits just 45 decibels of noise at fifty feet and full throttle. In comparison, gas leaf blowers emit between 70-90 decibels of sound at the same condition, while the quietest electric leaf blowers on the market emit around 57-59 decibels.
Whisper engineers started playing around with the concept for a quiet leaf blower after the company had already developed and flown an early-generation 10-pound thruster for a demonstrator drone. Using some 3D printed parts and spare batteries, they modified the propulsor into a leaf blower MVP.
“We were blown away,” Villa said, likely not intending to make such a good pun. “It was just insane how magically quiet it was. We looked at the numbers and we said, Okay, we know how much thrust this produces. […] And it dawned on us, not only was it quiet, but it has to be moving more air than an equivalent handheld leaf blower.”
Whisper set up the very same testing rigs that outdoor power equipment vendors use, so they’ve been able to do direct comparisons between a Whisper Drive-enabled blower and blowers available for purchase. Whisper engineers have also been able to subject the blower to aviation-grade testing, which has allowed them to measure thrust and noise to a highly precise degree, Villa said.
While the company was able to prove tremendous noise reduction with just a prototype, it wasn’t consumer-friendly in terms of costs, so Whisper had to think seriously about how to scale manufacturing up and drive costs down.
“The leaf blower was a way to tackle that in a product aligned way, where we can perform these experiments, come up with something that we knew the public wanted, but then also solve [the question of] how are we going to make these thrusters cheap enough for commercial drones. To us it was a win-win.”
The biggest way the company’s been able to bring costs down is via an injection molding technique using low-cost materials. The most expensive part of the leaf blower is the battery, and Villa said that Whisper Drive’s improved efficiency will generate longer run times and decreased battery weight.
Leaf blowers may seem relatively low tech – blow air, move leaves – but this is exactly why they’re such a prime product to target, Whisper says. More and more communities have enacted usage restrictions on leaf blowers due to the noise, which is bad news for lawncare workers, especially those that live in hot areas and may not be able to start work during the coolest parts of the day. Depending on use, workers may also be required under federal law to wear hearing protection. Whisper Drive-enabled leaf blowers would make noise restrictions irrelevant and hearing protection unnecessary.
To be clear, Whisper is not building a leaf blower (just the propulsor), but the company is already in talks with a few potential partners to bring the ultra-quiet blower to the market. Villa said the company’s goal is to lock in a partnership toward the end of this year or beginning of next year, so that the blower can be available for purchase by 2025 or sooner.
The new product is part of Whisper’s broader strategy to bring in early revenue and diversify its portfolio – going after high-thrust defense and commercial aviation on one end, to lower-thrust products like leaf blowers or commercial drones on the other.
“We have a significant portion of the team working on high thrust we also have a significant portion of the team are working on low thrust,” Villa said. “Really, they’re synergistic.”
A quieter, more efficient and affordable electric leaf blower may even be the final nudge in turning the lawncare industry – which has historically relied on gas-powered machinery – greener. While the percentage of the electric lawn equipment market has been rapidly growing, especially amongst individual consumers, it’s still not the majority.
“A lot of landscapers have already gotten on the bandwagon,” Villa said. “When you look at the dollars and look at the economics of it, just like how electric aviation has favorable economics to some alternatives, the same thing is true in the landscaping space. The trouble is, you have these favorable economics, but there’s limitations. To break through those limitations in terms of run time, in terms of performance, in terms of noise, you need enabling technology.”
“This Whisper Drive that we’re able to use in a leaf blower application, is that key enabler.”","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Whisper-Leaf-Blower-Demo-Prototype.jpg?resize=1200,900",2023-10-18 13:00:43
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/18/allara-a-telehealth-platform-for-women-with-chronic-hormonal-conditions-raises-10m-series-a/,"Allara, a telehealth platform for women with chronic hormonal conditions, raises $10M Series A","Chronic hormonal conditions such as polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and endometriosis are common in women, but also commonly go undiagnosed or inadequately treated. Allara, a New York–based telehealth startup, wants to help connect women with conditions like these with qualified medical practitioners and registered dietitians via its platform.
PCOS is one of the most common causes of female infertility, affecting as many as 5 million women, or 1 in 10 of reproductive age in the U.S., according to the CDC. Moreover, about 10% of women across the globe, which is equivalent to 176 million, have endometriosis.
Despite how widespread these conditions are, patients with chronic hormonal disorders often undergo years of suffering before receiving treatment, and “up to 70% of cases are undiagnosed worldwide,” per the World Health Organization.
Allara CEO and founder Rachel Blank experienced firsthand how challenging it is to get adequate support for PCOS; she was diagnosed with it at 21, after years of unexplained medical issues.
“I sought support from various doctors and specialists, did my own research, and played whack-a-mole with lifestyle changes, but wasn’t able to find effective and holistic care for my condition,” Blank told TechCrunch. “There is no FDA-approved treatment for this widespread, chronic condition.”
Allara hopes to change that with its comprehensive approach and care team that includes OB-GYNs, women’s health nurse practitioners, endocrinologists and registered dietitians who deeply understand hormonal and metabolic care. Dr. Heather Huddleston, chief medical advisor of Allara and director of the PCOS clinic at the University of California, San Francisco, leads Allara’s expert advisory board.
The two-year-old startup said it has raised $10 million in a Series A round led by Google Ventures with participation from Great Oaks Venture Capital, Humbition, Vanterra, Gaingels and angel investors like One Medical founder Tom Lee and Maggie Sellers. Google Ventures’ general partner Frédérique Dame will join Allara’s board of directors. The new money brings its total capital raised to $17.5 million.
Blank has worked in digital health since 2018 and was formerly director of strategy at health tech startup Ro. Allara’s virtual care platform offers a monthly subscription service that enables patients to access ongoing medical, lifestyle, nutrition, and emotional support for hormonal, metabolic and gynecological conditions and helps them see improved health outcomes. The startup claims that 75% of patients start to feel better within one month of working with Allara.
Since the launch, Allara has expanded “from specialized PCOS care to comprehensive care services for women with hormonal, metabolic and gynecologic conditions,” Blank said.
Over the past year alone, the startup’s patient base grew fivefold, and it partnered with major insurers, including Cigna, Anthem, Aetna, Empire and United Healthcare, in eight states, covering approximately 30 million lives to provide quality care for women nationwide.
The Series A proceeds will help Allara extend its insurance coverage, launch partnerships with health systems to continue patient care, conduct clinical research and scale its operations for further care, which currently includes research-backed supplements and mental health services based on patient requests.
When asked about its partnerships with the health system, Blank said, “Allara was not built to compete with the traditional health system, but to help close a massive care gap that exists for women’s health.”
The company is in talks with health systems and large fertility groups “to help improve access to chronic care and pre- and post-op management, delivered virtually — rather than requiring patients to visit multiple providers and put their care together themselves. Allara’s platform “allows these health systems and highly specialized providers to focus more on the procedures that need to be done in person.”
“The health system often views women’s healthcare as limited to pregnancy and fertility, but many women deal with chronic, specific conditions that require a whole-body, preventative approach,” Blank said. “Our patients are often in their 20s and 30s and looking to improve their overall health or are a few years out from conception and trying to get a head start on improving their health and fertility.”","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1124695995.jpg?resize=1200,800",2023-10-18 13:00:37
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/18/squares-new-ai-features-include-a-website-and-restaurant-menu-generator/,Square's new AI features include a website and restaurant menu generator,"Square, the financial services platform, is embracing generative AI in a very visible way.
After announcing earlier this year that it would bring AI features to drive retail sales, Square this morning took the wraps off of new ten — count ’em, ten — generative AI capabilities focused on customer content creation, onboarding and setup.
All are available as of today, albeit some gated behind Square’s beta program
The push, it might be said, is an attempt by Square — and parent company Block — to reinvigorate the Square platform after a difficult, downward-trending year and change.
Revenues from Block’s Cash App, the peer-to-peer payments service, have declined steeply. Meanwhile, the buy now, pay later service Afterpay, which Block acquired in 2021 for $29 billion, has posted serious losses. Block’s Bitcoin revenue has fallen corresponding with the fall in the price of the cryptocurrency last year. And Square faces growing competition on multiple fronts. including from Fiserv’s Clover, Toast and Stripe.
Investors are displeased. Square stock has retreated around 30% so far in 2023, as Block founder Jack Dorsey prepares to take the reigns from former Square head Alyssa Henry.
So Square’s giving stockholders generative AI.
One of the new AI-powered features, Menu Generator, allows restaurants to create a “full menu” on Square in “just minutes,” the platform promises in a press release.
“This is a valuable tool in particular for new restaurant sellers who don’t have or aren’t ready to upload a menu during onboarding,” a Square clarified to me via email. “With Menu Generator, restaurants can now create a full menu on Square … with the flexibility to come back and change or update that menu later after they’ve finished other set-up tasks. This gives them — or any business looking to expand into food and drink offerings — valuable momentum when launching operations on Square.”
Given generative AI’s tendency to go off the rails, I’d be wary of using it to publish a menu — particularly considering that gross inaccuracies could land restaurants on the hook for lawsuits over false advertising. But Square emphasizes that the process — which relies on a range of third-party generative AI models including OpenAI’s GPT-3, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 — isn’t fully automated and that customers are afforded the chance to make edits before a menu hits the web.
“All of our AI-generated content is offered as suggestions to sellers, giving them the ability to save as-is or make further edits,” the spokesperson said. “The human review process comes from sellers themselves, who approve or modify all copy created to ensure it helps them meet their business goals.”
Human review is also baked into Square’s new generative email copy feature, according to the spokesperson, which taps generative AI to create personalized email messages to customers. And it’s a component of Square’s newly-launched website copy generator, which writes headlines — and entire blogs — given a brief text prompt.
I asked Square whether it’d taken steps to ensure that copy from its website tool wouldn’t result in downranking by search engines who don’t look kindly on certain, obviously duplicative forms of AI-generated content. In response, the spokesperson pointed to Square’s partnerships and integrations with Google to “help small businesses overcome … discoverability hurdles” — but didn’t answer the question directly.
As a part of the raft of new generative AI capabilities, Square’s point of sales system can now auto-generate item descriptions for seller catalogs. Square pitches this as a massive time saver — but color me skeptical. eBay recently rolled out a similar item description generator and the feedback has been less than stellar, with users complaining about repetitiveness and fluff in the AI-generated descriptions.
When presented with these concerns, the Square spokesperson noted that item descriptions from the generator are created “based on inputs from sellers, including keywords to keep descriptions focused, and length and tone guidelines to avoid overly verbose or fluffy results.” But it remains to be seen if sellers adhere to these guidelines.
Elsewhere on the AI front (not necessarily generative AI, despite how Square refers to them in the press release), the Kitchen Display System, Square’s kiosk for restaurant order management, can now auto-assign menu items to kitchen categories and station screens. Square’s scheduling system, Appointments, can automatically import service names, descriptions, durations and prices during onboarding, meanwhile. And Square’s namesake point-of-sales platform now suggests items for sellers to adopt “based on insights about their business.” (It’s not clear exactly which insights — the press release doesn’t specify.)
Square Team Communication, which adds announcements and messaging to Square Team, Square’s app for employee scheduling and time tracking, is now able to generate and send out announcements to let employees know about new products and upcoming promotions. (The topic, length and tone are adjustable, Square says.) And Square Messages, Square’s business-customer messaging platform, can now suggest “sophisticated” AI responses, with the ability to personalize messages with replies that prepopulate customer names. (This upgrades Square Messages’ existing reply generator, which Square claims is generating 450,000 messages per month.)
In the press release, Saumil Mehta, Square’s head of point of sale, is quoted as saying that the new generative AI capabilities put Square “at the forefront of technology.”
“Square is uniquely positioned to be the technology partner that enables the most seamless, intuitive applications of AI,” Mehta said.
Me, I’m not so sure. But if the sheer breadth of today’s rollout is any indication, Square’s ambitious if nothing else.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-608877629.jpg?resize=1200,871",2023-10-18 13:00:02
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/18/amazon-pharmacy-launches-its-first-drone-deliveries/,Amazon Pharmacy launches its first drone deliveries,"Amazon’s Prime Air drone service has been slow to take off for the company, with limited operations in just two locales a whole decade after Amazon first started development of the program. Now, Prime Air is getting a small injection of activity, quite literally: today, Amazon announced the launch of drone deliveries of medicines purchased through Amazon Pharmacy, its online prescription drug store.
Amazon said packages will be dropped by drone within 60 minutes of being ordered via Amazon Pharmacy. The first city for the service will be College Station, Texas.
Amazon Pharmacy currently covers around 500 medications, including those for flu, asthma, and pneumonia; and (for now) the drone service will be free to use, Amazon said. (And despite the name “Prime” in its branding, it’s open to all customers, not just those paying for the company’s Prime membership.)
Amazon had signalled its plans to offer Pharmacy deliveries in College Station previously, but the company has declined to say where else it might expand, or when. College Station, along with Lockeford, California, are the only two markets where Prime Air drones have been rolled out so far (deliveries up to now have covered a limited set of non-Pharmacy products including household products, office supplies and beauty items).
Markets where Amazon has launched same-day delivery for Pharmacy are Austin, Indianapolis, Miami, Phoenix, and Seattle — so those might be some of the next markets for drone deliveries, too (pending regulatory clearance).
Amazon has been slowly adding new services into Pharmacy to make it more market-competitive — for example RxPass, launched earlier this year, lets customers get access to certain medications they take regularly for a $5 flat fee). Prime Air, on the other hand, has been a slow burner for the company.
Amazon’s drone delivery program, in the works since 2013, made its first delivery in 2016, in England. In the U.S., Amazon scored a win in 2020, when it got approval from the Federal Aviation Authority to trial services.
But a series of regulatory and other technical issues have impeded the tech giant from making any significant roll out since then, with a mere 100 deliveries to its name as of May 2023. To that end, multiple observers have pointed out how it’s been surpassed by offerings from some of its biggest competitors. For instance, Walmart, which has worked with third-party drone providers rather than building a service in-house, has made tens of thousands of deliveries with partners Zipline (a specialist in drone-based medical deliveries) and soon Alphabet’s Wing.
There is an obvious logic to adding drone delivery to Amazon’s pharmacy service. If a person is unwell and unable to collect prescriptions in person, but is also needing them urgently and may not have someone else to help them out, drone becomes a quick and easy route for that customer.
Amazon’s focus on that at-home opportunity is not contained just to the delivery of meds. Amazon Clinic provides virtual evaluations and treatment recommendations covering some 35 conditions; and the company’s One Medical service (which it acquired for $3.9 billion in July 2022) provides virtual and in-person primary care services. Adding drones into that mix completes the virtual service loop.
“We’re taught from the first days of medical school that there is a golden window that matters in clinical medicine,” said Dr. Vin Gupta, chief medical officer of Amazon Pharmacy, in a statement. “That’s the time between when a patient feels unwell and when they’re able to get treatment. We’re working hard at Amazon to dramatically narrow the golden window from diagnosis to treatment, and drone delivery marks a significant step forward. Whether it’s an infectious disease or respiratory illness, early intervention can be critical to improving patient outcomes.”
There is a business logic too: delivery trucks have very high costs associated with them, from labor through to the operation (and insurance) of the vehicles themselves.
The company tells me that the operation in College Station is based around a pharmacy it opened in the town to lay the groundwork for the drone delivery service: the medications are overseen by a pharmacist onsite and then loaded on the drone located immediately outside the pharmacy. This also points to is an interesting opportunity down the line: Amazon working with other pharmacies, not owned by Amazon, offering similar drone delivery services to them.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/AP_Drone_Bottles-Drone.jpg?resize=1200,801",2023-10-18 12:38:47
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/18/clearview-wins-ico-appeal/,"Selfie-scraper, Clearview AI, wins appeal against UK privacy sanction","Controversial US facial recognition company, Clearview AI, has won an appeal against a privacy sanction issued by the UK last year.
In May 2022, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) issued a formal enforcement notice on Clearview — which included a fine of around £7.5 million (~$10M) — after concluding the self-scraping AI firm had committed a string of breaches of local privacy laws. It also ordered the company, which uses the scraped personal data to sell an identity-matching service to law enforcement and national security bodies, to delete information it held on UK citizens.
Clearview filed an appeal against the decision. And in a ruling issued yesterday its legal challenge to the ICO prevailed on jurisdiction grounds after the tribunal ruled the company’s activities fall outside the jurisdiction of UK data protection law owing to an exemption related to foreign law enforcement.
Although the tribunal did agree with the ICO’s argument that Clearview’s processing was related to the monitoring of data subjects’ behavior carried out by its clients. It also found the company to be a joint controller for the processing. But the ICO’s case came unstuck on legal jurisdiction.
The UK’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) stipulates that the processing of personal data by competent authorities for law enforcement purposes is outside its scope — and is instead subject to rules in Part 3 of the Data Protection Act 2018 (which brought the EU Law Enforcement Directive EU2016/680 into UK law, post-Brexit).
Per the ruling, Clearview argued it’s a foreign company providing its service to “foreign clients, using foreign IP addresses, and in support of the public interest activities of foreign governments and government agencies, in particular in relation to their national security and criminal law enforcement functions”.
The tribunal accepted its claim to provide service exclusively to non-UK/EU law enforcement or national security bodies and their contractors (and that all such contractors also only carry out criminal law enforcement and/or national security functions) — overturning the ICO’s enforcement decision finding a string of breaches of the UK GDPR.
Contacted for a response to the ruling, an ICO spokesperson emailed us this statement:
The ICO will take stock of today’s judgment and carefully consider next steps. It is important to note that this judgment does not remove the ICO’s ability to act against companies based internationally who process data of people in the UK, particularly businesses scraping data of people in the UK, and instead covers a specific exemption around foreign law enforcement.
The data protection watchdog did not confirm whether or not it will appeal. It’s also not clear why the ICO did not bring a claim against the Clearview under the DPA 2018, rather than the UK GDPR.
Clearview, meanwhile, welcomed the tribunal ruling. “We are pleased with the tribunal’s decision to reverse the UK ICO’s unlawful order against Clearview AI,” said general counsel, Jack Mulcaire, in a brief response statement.
The UK sanction was just one of a number of enforcements that have been brought against Clearview in recent years under regional data protection laws.
Data protection authorities in France, Italy and Greece have found the US firm in breach of the EU’s GDPR — which the UK’s domestic data protection framework is based on. However, since Brexit, the UK GDPR is distinct law — so it’s not clear whether this tribunal ruling will have direct implications for other enforcements against Clearview which make reference to the EU’s GDPR.
Nonetheless, DPAs in the bloc have also struggled to enforce their will on Clearview.
Back in May, France’s CNIL confirmed Clearview had not paid the penalties it had levied — and announced a further fine for non-payment at that point. The authority had also ordered Clearview to delete data on French citizens and banned further unlawful processing. But it’s not clear the CNIL has been able to enforce those injunctions either.
Earlier this year the French authority told TechCrunch it was talking to the US Federal Trade Commission — “to discuss how we can ensure that the injunction issued against the company is enforced”. We’ve contacted CNIL for an update on its efforts to make Clearview comply with its orders. Update: A CNIL spokesperson confirmed Clearview still has not paid the penalties ordered. They also told us it has not appealed the regulatory sanction either.
We’ve also reached out to the Italian and Greek DPAs with questions about their own procedures against it and will update this report with any responses.
The Clearview case highlights the challenges for European regulators of trying to enforce data protection rules, which — in the case of the GDPR at least — do apply extraterritorially, i.e. against foreign-located firms processing local people’s data. But Clearview’s pivot to fully focusing its business on law enforcement and national security agencies appears to have complicated the legal picture.
The company claims it does not have any local customers, saying it does not provide its service to users located in the UK or EU. But that was not always the case. Back in 2021, Sweden’s data protection authority targeted a previous Clearview customer for enforcement — fining the Swedish Police Authority €250,000 ($300,000+) for unlawful use of its AI tech which it found was in breach of the country’s Criminal Data Act.
That investigation was specific to the local police authority’s use of Clearview’s tool — with the Swedish authority finding it had not fulfilled its legal obligations as a data controller, including by failing to implement sufficient organisational measures to demonstrate the processing was compliant with the law (such as not conducting a data protection impact assessment). But it underlines that law enforcement authorities operating in the EU don’t have carte blanche to use Clearview.
Indeed, the opposite may be true; it may be that local law enforcement cannot — lawfully — make use of a tool that triggers so many fundamental rights concerns.
The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) and the European Data Protection Supervisor have previously called for a ban on the processing of personal data in a law enforcement context “that would rely on a database populated by collection of personal data on a mass-scale and in an indiscriminate way”, as the EDPB put it last year — explicitly giving the example of scraping photographs and facial pictures from the public internet (as Clearview does).
The EDPB also published detailed guidance on the use of facial recognition in law enforcement that cautions authorities they can’t ignore data protection rules and principles — and must make careful assessments of “necessity and proportionality”, when considering adopting AI tools; as well as examining “all possible implications for other fundamental rights”.
So the bloc’s data protection framework does make it very difficult — or even impossible — for Clearview to sell its privacy-hostile services to regional law enforcement clients. Even as the GDPR puts limits on its ability to sell services to regional customers for any other purposes.
Over the pond, meanwhile, recent US litigation against Clearview by the ACLU, under an Illinois law banning the use of individuals’ biometric data without consent, ended in a settlement last year that included a national ban on the company selling or giving away access to its facial recognition database to private companies and individuals — essentially limiting its business to US government contracts (except for state or local government entities in Illinois itself, which were covered by the ban).
So, for European regulators, the question is whether they can do anything much to stop a US company hoovering up data on their citizens and selling privacy-hostile facial-matching to US law enforcement or other foreign authorities and state agencies?
Under current laws and enforcement powers that looks tricky.
The controversy around Clearview has landed on the radar of EU lawmakers who are working on establishing a risk-based framework for regulating applications of artificial intelligence. And, earlier this year, MEPs in the European Parliament backed amendments to the draft EU AI Act that proposed expanding a list of prohibited AI practices to include what amounts to a Clearview clause. This amendment would explicitly ban indiscriminate scraping of biometric data from social media sites (and elsewhere) to create facial recognition databases — an action MEPs affirmed as violating human rights, including the right to privacy.
The bloc’s co-legislators are still working on the AI Act file. So it remains to be seen whether the proposed prohibition on scraping selfies to power facial recognition-based ID matching will make it into the final text. If it does, it would clearly further harden regional law against Clearview.
But, once again, whether a fresh network of regional regulators, tasked with enforcing the AI Act, will have any more success at forcing an uncooperative foreign firm to stop abusing Europeans’ rights remains to be seen.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GettyImages-1306235479.jpg?resize=1200,1133",2023-10-18 12:37:32
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/18/biden-china-nvidia-a800-h800-chips/,Biden further chokes off China's AI chip supply with Nvidia bans,"In August last year, a ban on Nvidia’s chip export to China sent the country’s budding artificial intelligence startups scrambling for alternatives. A momentary sense of relief came when Nvidia unveiled chips with reduced performance to bypass export restrictions. But this respite was short-lived.
On Tuesday, the Biden administration announced a slew of measures to curb Beijing’s military ambitions, including a further restriction on Nvidia’s AI chip shipments to China. A800 and H800, the two AI chips Nvidia designed specifically to continue shipping to China, will be hit by the fresh round of new rules.
The chip bans are originally targeted at China’s military use, but the more visible victims are arguably the country’s raft of startups riding the rapid advancement of large language models. Many of them rushed to stockpile Nvidia’s A100 and H100 before the bans went into effect, shelling out millions of dollars for the inflated costs. Alibaba, Baidu, ByteDance, and Tencent, collectively ordered $5 billion of A800 chips this year and the next, according to a report from the Financial Times.
Nascent startups, meanwhile, are driven to raise venture capital hastily to support their costly AI dreams.
The U.S. chip bans have not stopped Chinese giants from pursuing their AI ambitions. On Tuesday, Baidu unveiled the latest version of its flagship foundation model, Ernie 4.0, and claimed that it now matches GPT4. To date, Ernie has amassed 45 million users, the company claimed.
The challenge of entering China’s AI fray goes beyond increasingly limited semiconductor access. The country’s regulations require that LLM-based services obtain a license before serving public users, a test of companies’ government relations and their ability to navigate the red tape.
Ultimately, a shortage of high-end chips and the intricate nature of Beijing’s censorship requirements created an environment for generative business intelligence services to flourish, as they require less computational power (data sources are internal rather than the entire internet) and are comparatively easier to control as prompts are more scenario-based. Qianfan, Baidu’s enterprise-facing AI platform built on Ernie, has amassed some 17,000 customers.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/T-15882236-L.jpg?w=1200,2023-10-18 12:15:08
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/18/snap-partners-edtech-company-inspirit-bring-ar-tech-50-us-schools/,Snap partners with edtech company Inspirit to bring its AR tech to 50 US schools,"Snap is partnering with edtech company Inspirit to bring augmented reality into classrooms to help students better understand STEM lessons, the company announced on Wednesday. The two companies are working together to create 25 AR Lenses and STEM curriculums that will be used by at least 50 across the United States next year.
One of the AR Lenses is designed to help students find the volume of a cylinder, while another gets users to tap on bubbles and choose the correct volume to pop them.
Snap says that since launching its pilot program, it found that 85% of students said AR helped with memory and retention. The company says it also found that AR lessons increased engagement by nearly 50%, and that 92% of students found AR content easy to understand.
“With custom-built Lenses brought into an easy to use mobile application with Camera Kit, Inspirit designed a transformative curriculum that pairs Snap’s AR technology with a comprehensive learning guide, empowering teachers to facilitate dynamic learning and students to achieve their best, whether they’re learning from the classroom or at home,” the company wrote in a blog post. “The curriculum is designed to stimulate classroom engagement, boost confidence levels, and improve students’ self-efficacy.”
Snap’s venture into AR for education comes a month after the company shut down its AR Enterprise Services division after less than a year of its launch. The initiative, which was announced in March, gave brands access to tools that allowed them to do things like access AR try-on features, a 3D viewer for looking at a product from multiple angles, fit and sizing recommendation technology and an enterprise manager for their digital assets. The company said that building up the initiative would take “significant” investment and it that couldn’t continue to fund those efforts.
Although Snap has seen declining revenue, the company’s shares rose nearly 12% yesterday after reports revealed than an internal memo said Snap could post better-than-expected results next year. The memo revealed that Snap could reach more than 475 million daily active users in 2024, beating analysts’ predictions of 448 million, according to a report from The Verge.
Snap is scheduled to release its Q3 2023 earnings results on October 24.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-647104884.jpg?resize=1200,800",2023-10-18 12:00:48
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/18/passwordless-authentication-startup-securew2-raises-80m-from-insight-partners/,Passwordless authentication startup SecureW2 raises $80M from Insight Partners,"Passwordless authentication offers a host of advantages over traditional pins, passphrases and passcodes. Surveys around the web show that compromised passwords cause an estimated 81% of all breaches and that the average person reuses passwords up to 14 times, giving hackers access to a big chunk of one’s digital footprint if they crack the code just once.
But despite the fact that it’s more secure, passwordless tech is running up against barriers to adoption — at least in the enterprise. A Harris Poll study found that 48% of companies didn’t have passwordless authentication as of 2021, in part because they believed that they lacked the right skills and teams to successfully implement it.
This is to the benefit of platforms like SecureW2, who’ve made a business out of abstracting away the steps required to deploy and maintain infrastructure for passwordless authentication. Case in point, SecureW2 this morning announced that it raised $80 million in funding from Insight Partners, SecureW2’s first-ever round.
Max Wolff, a principal at Insight Partners, which not long ago led a massive investment in passwordless security vendor Transmit Security, says that SecureW2’s customer momentum is what clinched the deal.
“Organizations are increasingly looking for alternatives to traditional passwords to authenticate access to networks and applications,” Wolff said via email. “SecureW2 provides an easy-to-use, cloud-native solution to address this need that’s already being used by hundreds of customers worldwide.”
SecureW2, based in Seattle, started as an open source project that allowed IT departments with “non-Windows” identity environments to connect Windows devices to their wired and wireless network infrastructure. The creators, Tom Rixom and Bert Kashyap, were spurred to launch the project by the growing frequency of password-based attacks — and, they say, by the unattractiveness of enterprise passwordless authentication solutions at the time.
“It became clear to us that there was a need for a fresh software-as-a-service-based and low-friction approach for IT teams,” Kashyap, SecureW2’s CEO, told TechCrunch in an email interview.
Rixom and Kashyap eventually incorporated SecureW2, which today offers a suite of passwordless technologies including a tool to issues certificates — digital replacements for passwords — to authorize access to a customer’s Wi-Fi, ethernet or VPN. SecureW2’s platform makes certificates available across most mobile and desktop operating systems, and can connect to cloud identity environments like Okta to extend policy-based security across a company’s environment.
“From business and government organizations to colleges and school districts, password-based connectivity to network infrastructure leads to potential disconnects due to password rotation procedures,” Kashyap said. “Eliminating user frustration and productivity loss drives direct return on investment along with the security benefits of ensuring those passwords that are used to also access other apps and resources aren’t susceptible to compromise.”
SecureW2, which has just under a thousand customers and “millions” of users, according to Kashyap, has been bootstrapped until now — and profitable with free cash flow. But it took on funding for two reasons: expanding its go-to-market efforts and ramping up software development and R&D in “product categories that surround SecureW2’s space,” Kashyap said.
“We’ve historically used machine learning to understand and predict how devices are connecting to infrastructure environments, and we have plans to expose some of these elements directly to the customer so that they may benefit from security anomaly detection, capacity planning and more,” Kashyap said. “As awareness grows of the need for a passwordless approach in both corporate environments and non-corporate infrastructure, we’re providing simple and cost-competitive solutions to drive adoption and growth.”
SecureW2 has 70 employees currently and expects to end the year with around 80.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-1399729683-1.jpg?resize=1200,708",2023-10-18 12:00:21
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/18/darwinium-brings-digital-security-and-fraud-prevention-to-the-edge/,Darwinium brings digital security and fraud prevention to the perimeter,"Back in 2018, LexisNexis acquired the digital identity platform ThreatMetrix for just under $820 million in cash. In 2021, ThreatMetrix co-founders Reed Taussig and Alisdair Faulkner returned to the world of startups when, together with a number of ex-ThreatMetrix engineers and execs Vic, they launched Darwinium, a fraud prevention platform that focuses on protecting fintech, e-commerce, financial services, gaming and gambling services at their digital perimeter without putting too much of a burden on users.
In late 2022, the company raised a $10 million seed round led by Australian VC firm Blackbird alongside Airtree. A number of prominent angel investors, including Naval Ravikant and Jeff Fagnan also participated in this round. Today, Darwinium announced that it has raised another $18 million in a Series A round led by U.S. venture partners, with participation from its existing investors.
“Fraud is just getting worse,” Faulkner explained. “There’s a lot of companies — ThreatMetrix among them — that are doing an admirable job. But fraud still is getting worse despite all of these tools. Merchants and banks are just deploying more and more and more [of these tools], but they’re all disconnected, they don’t share the same data model, and the result is increasing costs to try and stop the fraud, increasing friction for customers, and just more lost revenue over time. Then you throw in the potential of AI and it just suggests that things are going to get worse before they get better.”
Faulkner described Darwinium as ‘the self-driving car for digital security and fraud.” You can’t just build a defense, you actually have to build something that simulates the attack using generative AI models. People are looking at that in terms of images, deep fakes, and others. Darwinium is the first company that is pioneering this approach to be able to have not just defense but also simulating attacks and having those solutions duke it out” (I guess that’s AI security Darwinism at work…).
Faulkner argues that even the best bot detection tools today are still blunt tools that can’t understand customer behaviors — something that fraudsters can now leverage thanks to AI. For customers, that means more CAPTCHAs they have to solve before they can make a purchase, which isn’t a great user experience, all while fraud teams can’t be sure that bots aren’t making it past their perimeter.
In contrast, Darwinium aims to collect more signals at the perimeter — long before a customer (or bot) enters a credit card number, for example. Ideally, Darwinium can understand the behavioral context of a user journey and allow downstream tools — and fraud teams — to take more tailored action based on the company’s bot score.
One nifty aspect of Darwinium is that it places its service right there at the perimeter, too, integrating with content delivery networks like Cloudflare and AWS CloudFront. The service also integrates with other third-party tools to enrich its data.
“The Darwinium team has built something truly unique,” says Rick Lewis, General Partner at
USVP. “Darwinium offers a product that is both simple to deploy and effective at reducing fraud
losses and reputational damage associated with the ever-more complex web of digital fraud.
Darwinium is a game-changer, differentiated in a crowded market, offering the innovation that
businesses are asking for to simplify their risk stack.”","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1310129244.jpg?resize=1200,646",2023-10-18 12:00:14

The firm, which began operations in 2021, has already amassed over a 1,000 customers, said Neo founder Nitin Jain in an interview.
The two firms reserve the optionality to extend the size of the investment, they said. TechCrunch reported in August that Peak XV was engaging with Neo for an investment. Neo earlier raised about $40 million from a list of undisclosed investors.
Despite being second only to China in high-net-worth individuals among BRICS countries, and being home to more than 14,000 ultra high net-worth households, India’s wealth management sector remains underdeveloped, plagued by a trust deficit and misaligned incentives.
Part of the reason is that the industry is often more geared toward product sales than tailored financial advice, said Jain, who like many of his co-founders and other founding members of Neo started the venture after long stints at investment giant Edelweiss.
On the advisory side, Neo serves as an extended CIO to multi-family offices, participating in their investment committees and offering views on asset allocation, corporate holding structure and taxations.
“We sit on their side. It’s slightly different from the classical wealth management practice as we are advising as well as selling products to them. So this is a very unique proposition,” he said.
The startup works with multiple relationship managers, providing them with additional resources and incentives that supplement their existing practices. Jain said he estimates that 350 to 400 RMs in India control 70 to 75% of assets. Neo will aim to attract about 100 of them in the next two to three years, he said.
On the asset management side, Neo focuses on long-term yield-based solutions in real estate and private credit for clients that are looking to generate an income from their investments.
Neo already has about $3 billion of assets under management, it said. The startup didn’t need new capital and doesn’t anticipate raising more than one more round in the future, said Jain.
Sakshi Chopra, an MD at Peak XV Partners, said the firm had been tracking Jain’s journey for over a year and in Neo it found the right combination of experience, expertise and opportunity.
“The founding team, they built asset businesses at Nuvama and Edelweiss, is very high-quality and this is all they have done through their lives,” she said in an interview, adding that the two firms began engaging about 15 months ago. “We share the philosophy on doing good for the people who trust us with their money.”
Having Peak XV becoming a partner will help Neo recruit high-quality talent, said Jain, citing the venture firm’s strong reputation and brand image.
With the investment in Neo, Peak XV Partners is expanding its portfolio of startups that operate in the asset and wealth management category. The venture firm is also backer of CRED and Groww, though both are currently serving different sets of audiences.
And more players are gearing up to serve the market. Jio Financial Services — backed by Reliance Industries, run by Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani — in July said it had partnered with BlackRock to form an asset manager venture, called Jio BlackRock, that will aim to serve India’s growing investor base.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-520120864.jpg?resize=1200,780",2023-10-18 11:33:16
https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/revolutionising-the-green-economy-with-vein-graphite/35747/,Revolutionising the green economy with vein graphite,"Exploration company Reflex Advanced Materials is working to unearth a vein graphite treasure trove in Montana, US.
In pursuing a sustainable and eco-friendly future, the demand for natural graphite has soared, especially after more and more countries have started working towards the electrical green economy revolution.
Reflex Advanced Materials (CSE: RFLX) (OTCQB: RFLXF), a forward-thinking exploration company, has taken the lead in this valuable mineral by setting its sights on Montana’s past-producing vein graphite mine.
This move not only marks a pivotal step towards securing a domestic supply of graphite, but also plays a crucial role in bolstering national security, reducing dependence on foreign sources, and unleashing the potential of high-tech applications.
Synthetic versus natural: Unveiling the power of natural graphite
The power of natural graphite over its synthetic counterpart has become increasingly evident, bolstering the argument for a secure domestic supply within the US.
While the current battery industry leans towards synthetic graphite, which holds the lion’s share of the anode market, a shift is occurring. Businesses are moving towards natural graphite because of cost advantages and environmental benefits.
Superior conductivity
Natural graphite’s thermal and electrical conductivity outmatch synthetic graphite, making it the preferred choice in applications that require efficient energy transfer. For instance, the U.S. Geological Survey has identified natural graphite as one of the 35 critical minerals due to its unique properties, making it suitable for high-value applications like nuclear reactors, fuel cells, and graphene production.
Thermal resistance
Natural graphite maintains stability at high temperatures, a feature synthetic graphite lacks. This makes natural graphite ideal for applications that involve high heat.
Eco-friendliness
Natural graphite has a smaller carbon footprint than synthetic graphite, making it more environmentally friendly. The mining of natural graphite produces the only significant emissions, while synthetic graphite production releases over 4.9kg CO2 per kilogram, which is three times more CO2 than 1kg of natural graphite.
With these unique properties, natural graphite holds a clear edge over synthetic graphite. This advantage underscores the importance of Reflex’s efforts in securing a consistent domestic supply of this crucial mineral within the US.
The distinguishing brilliance of vein graphite
Natural graphite consists predominantly of two primary forms: flake graphite and vein graphite. Each has its distinguishing features, yet vein graphite stands out for its superior qualities, especially concerning its application in innovative and high-tech industries.
Flake graphite, the more common form, is predominantly used in refractories, foundries, and batteries. It is formed through the metamorphism of organic-rich sediments, resulting in a layered structure that is soft and flexible.
However, it requires extensive processing to remove impurities and achieve the desired particle size and shape, which can lead to higher costs and environmental impacts. Despite these drawbacks, it still carries significant market value due to its abundance and the wide range of industrial applications it can serve.
On the other hand, vein graphite, though rare, is highly valued for its unique properties that make it ideal for high-tech applications. This type of graphite is formed by the crystallisation of carbon-rich fluids in metamorphic rocks. It is known for its high carbon content (up to 99%), compared to flake graphite’s typical 85-95%. The high purity of vein graphite reduces the need for processing, making it cost effective and more environmentally friendly.
Distinguishing features of vein graphite include:
Crystalline structure : Vein graphite has a unique crystalline structure, giving it a higher thermal
conductivity than flake graphite. This makes it the preferred choice in electronics to energy storage industries;
: Vein graphite has a unique crystalline structure, giving it a higher thermal conductivity than flake graphite. This makes it the preferred choice in electronics to energy storage industries; High purity : With a carbon content of up to 99%, vein graphite’s high purity makes it ideal
for applications that require consistent quality and performance. Its exceptional purity is utilised in high-value applications such as nuclear reactors and fuel cells;
: With a carbon content of up to 99%, vein graphite’s high purity makes it ideal for applications that require consistent quality and performance. Its exceptional purity is utilised in high-value applications such as nuclear reactors and fuel cells; Eco-friendliness : Compared to flake graphite, vein graphite requires less processing. This, in turn, leads to less waste production, thus making vein graphite a more environmentally-friendly option; and
: Compared to flake graphite, vein graphite requires less processing. This, in turn, leads to less waste production, thus making vein graphite a more environmentally-friendly option; and Market value: Due to its rarity, purity, and unique properties, vein graphite commands a higher price per tonne than flake graphite, making it a higher-value product.
In terms of its use in advanced technologies, vein graphite’s unique crystalline structure makes it more favourable for high-tech applications.
For instance, the production of graphene, a cutting-edge material with vast potential in electronics, often employs vein graphite due to its high purity. Furthermore, its high thermal conductivity makes it suitable for nuclear reactors and fuel cells.
Given the importance of graphite, particularly vein graphite, in high-tech applications, securing a domestic material supply is crucial for the US.
As we progress towards a future powered by renewable energy and electric vehicles, the demand for high-quality vein graphite is expected to increase further, emphasising the need for a reliable and sustainable domestic source.
With the US currently dependent on imports for its graphite supply, establishing a robust domestic supply chain should be a top priority.
Securing a domestic supply with Reflex Advanced Materials
Reflex Advanced Materials Corp (CSE: RFLX) (OTCQB: RFLXF) has strategically moved toward safeguarding America’s domestic graphite supply by acquiring the rights to the Ruby Graphite Project in southwest Montana.
The Ruby Graphite Project is a past-producing mine that potentially holds vast amounts of natural vein graphite – a critical resource for various high-tech applications. This acquisition signifies a pivotal step in Reflex’s mission to reduce US dependence on foreign imports for graphite, particularly from China which currently holds a strong position in the global graphite market.
Growth in graphite demand
The demand for graphite, a key component in lithium-ion batteries, is projected to increase significantly with a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 8.01% from 2023 to 2028. As the electric vehicle space continues to expand, the need for graphite, particularly in the battery segment, will also surge, evident from the 80% increase in vehicle battery demand in 2022 in the US alone.
China’s dominance in graphite supply
Currently, China dominates the graphite market, accounting for over 60% of global production. Almost all downstream graphite processing involves at least one stage in China. The US can reduce dependence on China by developing a domestic source, as Reflex does at the Ruby Graphite Project, thereby securing supply chain stability.
Supporting US decarbonisation efforts
Graphite is essential for electric vehicles and other high-tech applications crucial to the US’ decarbonisation and vehicle electrification ambitions. Therefore, securing a domestic supply chain for this critical mineral is a requisite for these national goals.
Facing this level of demand, it is clear that decisive action is required to secure graphite supply for the future. Reflex Advanced Materials Corp is taking a giant leap towards building a robust domestic graphite supply chain by securing access to the Ruby Graphite Project.
This step is pivotal for the US to maintain its position in the electric vehicle market and reduce its dependence on foreign sources, ensuring a sustainable and secure future for its ambitious decarbonisation and vehicle electrification plans.
Empowering the electrical green economy revolution
The surging popularity of electric cars, hybrid cars, laptops, and smartphones, which all heavily rely on lithium-ion batteries, is causing the demand for graphite to skyrocket. Further fuelling the demand is the increasing adoption of high-technology applications like carbon-graphite composites and flexible graphite products.
The US, which imported 53,000 tons of natural graphite in 2021, with 33% of it coming from China, is starkly dependent on foreign sources for its graphite supply.
However, this dependence is poised to change with the US government allocating $750m under the Title III fund to support domestic production and supply chain development of critical minerals like graphite. President Joe Biden has also invoked the Defense Production Act to spur US production of minerals for electric vehicle batteries and reduce reliance on foreign supply.
One of the promising domestic graphite projects in the US is the Ruby Graphite Project in southwest Montana, managed by Reflex Advanced Materials Corp. This deposit aligns perfectly with the vision of a greener and more electrified future, and the U.S Department of Energy’s allocation of funds to develop the country’s battery supply chain further underscores this commitment.
The urgency to establish a secure supply of domestic graphite is about meeting the rising demand and empowering the US to lead the global green economy revolution. Thus, graphite stands at the heart of the sustainable future we strive to build.

https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/hardt-and-zeleros-sign-mou-to-european-hyperloop-deployment/38417/,Hardt and Zeleros sign MoU to European hyperloop deployment,"Leading hyperloop innovators Hardt, from the Netherlands and Zeleros, from Spain, have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to expedite the technical and commercial development of hyperloop.
The two leading hyperloop pioneers will work closely on a shared development roadmap to ensure their technologies are fully compatible across borders – overcoming an issue that plagues traditional transport, such as rail.
This synergistic approach to development is hoped to accelerate the deployment of the technology significantly, with both companies targeting 2030 for an operational pilot route.
David Pistoni, CEO of Zeleros, commented: “Together, we are able to multiply our impact to speed up the process of hyperloop commercialisation.
“We consider this as a first step of collaboration where others can add to further consolidate the industry.”
What is hyperloop?
Hyperloop is an ultra-high-speed, low-emission, fully autonomous mode of land transportation that promises to not only decarbonise passenger and cargo travel but also slash journey times significantly across Europe.
Capable of speeds of over 800km/h, in the hyperloop, vehicles are guided through a low-pressure system of tubes and are propelled, suspended, and guided with magnets.
This process drastically reduces rolling and aerodynamic friction, which reduces energy requirements. For example, hyperloop is ten times more energy efficient than road transport and aviation and uses 50% less energy than traditional rail.
The combined effects of this almost sci-fi-inspired transportation are astounding; it is estimated that trips across Europe that would once take up to six hours will be a mere fraction of that.
For example, hyperloop journeys from Munich to Milan or from Berlin to Warsaw would take just over an hour.
Now, the new MoU signed between Hardt and Zeleros looks to accelerate the technology considerably to make journeys between Europe’s major cities faster, cleaner, and more efficient than ever.
What will the collaboration involve?
Hardt and Zeleros will work together on the demonstration, de-risking, and implementation of the technology, with the development of an interoperable system to allow seamless transport across borders as the main priority.
Such technologies are currently under development in the Netherlands and Spain, with pilot projects at the European Hyperloop Center, Groningen, and the HyperTrack, Valencia.
By 2030, the companies are targeting an operational pilot route and are preparing for large-scale deployment whilst working to establish an open, accessible, and competitive hyperloop ecosystem throughout Europe.
Mars Geuze, co-founder and Chief Hyperloop Officer of Hardt Hyperloop, said: “The signing of this MoU with Zeleros is a great sign of collaboration and convergence within the hyperloop developments.
“Instead of competing, we are collaborating to make the hyperloop a reality in Europe and beyond.”
Innovation News Network will be publishing our experience of an exclusive visit to Hardt Hyperloop to provide a more in-depth look at the groundbreaking transport modality.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MoUZeleros1.jpeg,2023-10-18 13:43:08
https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/unlocking-space-for-business-set-benefit-organisations-around-uk/38411/,Unlocking Space for Business set to benefit organisations around the UK,"The UK Space Agency has launched the Unlocking Space for Business programme to help organisations take advantages of satellite data and services.
Unlocking Space for Business is an 18-month programme that will bring the benefits of satellite data and services to hundreds of new organisations across the UK. The programme primarily focuses on the leading transport, logistics, and financial services sectors.
The programme will offer the opportunity to bid for a share of up to £6m UK Space Agency funding later this year to help launch pilot projects, data procurement, and partnerships.
As well as this, Unlocking Space for Business will provide workshops, networking events, learning and development opportunities, and online resources to support companies in their understanding of what satellite data can do for them.
Dr Paul Bate, Chief Executive of the UK Space Agency, said: “Unlocking Space for Business will champion the use of space and help tackle barriers facing organisations that have not traditionally used satellite data or services.
“This will help catalyse further investment into our growing space sector and deliver greater benefits for businesses, people, and the environment.”
Harnessing the advantages offered by satellites
Global satellite services support activity that contributes £370bn to the UK economy. This is around 17.7% of the GDP.
A large number of businesses have the opportunity to harness the advantages offered by satellites, due to the cost of accessing space falling and the pace of innovation increasing. The advantages include enhanced imagery, connectivity, and navigation capabilities.
Specifically, satellite imagery can be used to improve the measurement of climate variables and verification of customer insurance claims after extreme weather events. Satellite position and navigation can also be utilised to support location tracking.
Passengers and crews can use satellite connectivity to stay in touch with operators on shore.
George Freeman MP, Minister of State at the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, said: “With UK space open for business like never before, sectors as diverse as transport and finance have a huge opportunity to bring the benefits of satellite data down to Earth and improve their operations, deliver for customers and ultimately grow their industries.”
Satellite data can unlock and deliver new revenue growth opportunities, operational efficiencies, ESG benefits, and improved customer experiences for businesses.
About the Unlocking Space for Business programme
Unlocking Space for Business is set to connect leading data suppliers, technology integrators, insight providers, and end-users with innovative solutions using satellite data and services.
PwC is supporting the delivery of the project.
Organisations can get involved with the Unlocking Space for Business programme and keep up to date with planned activities ahead of the funding call opening later in the year.
Unlocking Space for Business is part of the UK Space Agency’s Inspiration Programme, delivering the National Space Strategy goal.
Lucy Edge, Chief Operating Officer and Acting CEO at the Satellite Applications Catapult, said: “We’re excited to launch Unlocking Space for Business today.
“By bringing together key players in the satellite industry, integrators and end users, we’ll make it easier for businesses to access the business-critical data they did not even know was available to them.
“We’ll also connect companies with government funding sources to test out pilot projects using satellite tech.”",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/©-shutterstockgreenbutterfly_1421446100-1024x576.jpg,2023-10-18 13:37:49
https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/barriers-to-solar-energy-transition-identified-researchers/38395/,Barriers to solar energy transition identified by researchers,"In a study led by the University of Exeter and University College London, researchers have found four barriers to solar energy that must be resolved by the government.
The four barriers to solar energy are the creation of stable power grids, financing solar in developing economies, capacity of supply chains, and political resistance from regions that lose jobs.
Policies to resolve these barriers are thought to be more effective than price instruments such as carbon taxes in accelerating the clean energy transition.
The study, ‘The momentum of the solar energy transition,’ is part of the Economics of Energy Innovation and System Transition project, funded by the UK Government’s Department for Energy Security and Net Zero and the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF).
Solar PV is set to become the dominant power source
Based on a data-driven model of technology and economics, the study found that solar PV is expected to dominate the global power mix before 2050.
Solar energy is projected to become our main energy source, even without support from more ambitious climate policies.
Dr Femke Nijsse, from Exeter’s Global Systems Institute, said: “The recent progress of renewables means that fossil fuel-dominated projections are no longer realistic.
“In other words, we have avoided the ‘business as usual’ scenario for the power sector.
“However, older projections often rely on models that see innovation as something happening outside of the economy.
“In reality, there is a virtuous cycle between technologies being deployed and companies learning to do so more cheaply.
“When you include this cycle in projections, you can represent the rapid growth of solar in the past decade and into the future.
“Traditional models also tend to assume the ‘end of learning’ at some point in the near future – when in fact we are still seeing very rapid innovation in solar technology.
“Using three models that track positive feedbacks, we project that solar PV will dominate the global energy mix by the middle of this century.”
Four barriers to solar energy
However, energy systems dominated by solar energy could become “locked into configurations that are neither resilient nor sustainable, with a reliance on fossil fuel for dispatchable power.”
The government must therefore overcome the barriers to solar energy, rather than trying to bring about the solar transition in itself. These key barriers are:
Grid resilience
Solar generation is variable so processes must be put into place to deal with the variability. To build resilience instead of burning fossil fuels, the government could invest in other renewables, transmission cables linking different regions, and electricity storage and policy to manage demand.
The study stated that government subsidies and funding for research and development are important for initially creating grid resilience.
Access to finance
Another barrier to the solar energy transition is the availability of finance. Currently, low-carbon finance is concentrated in high-income countries.
International funding favours middle-income countries, leaving low-income countries deficient in solar finance despite the huge potential for investment.
Critical minerals supply chains
The solar energy transition requires many critical minerals, causing demand to increase.
It is estimated that renewable technologies will make up 40% of total mineral demand for copper and rare earth elements, between 60 and 70% for nickel and cobalt, and around 90% for lithium by 2040.
Securing a sustainable supply chain of these materials is a major challenge.
Political opposition
The final barrier to solar energy is resistance from declining industries. The pace of the solar energy transition depends on both the economic decisions of entrepreneurs and how desirable policymakers consider it.
If the solar energy transition is to accelerate quickly, the livelihood of around 13 million people working in fossil fuel industries globally may be put at risk.
Regional economic and industrial development policies can mitigate risks posed by resistance from declining industries.
These four barriers must be overcome to facilitate the solar energy transition, and to ensure that net zero goals are met.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/shutterstockKampan_1614874936.jpg,2023-10-18 09:58:17
https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/urgent-action-is-needed-to-tackle-the-plastic-recycling-postcode-lottery/36152/,Urgent action is needed to tackle the plastic recycling ‘postcode lottery’,"The University of Manchester ‘One Bin to Rule Them All’ project team outline how implementing a new plastic recycling system in the UK could improve participation rates.
Our ineffectiveness at recycling plastic packaging waste is causing a significant environmental problem.
Of the 2.5 million tonnes of plastic waste generated in the UK in 2021, just 44% was recycled and over 60% was sent abroad, exporting the problem of plastic waste to countries that often do not have the ability to re-use or dispose of this waste sustainably.
Recent years have seen consumers bombarded with campaigns promoting the importance of recycling, in an attempt drive up participation rates. However, whilst the intention and effort of such policies are welcome, they have had little success.
And, as shown in a new report written by The University of Manchester’s ‘One Bin to Rule Them All‘ project team – which involves a cross-sector consortium of 25 industry partners and local authorities – the blame does not in fact lie with consumers, but with the convoluted nature of the recycling system.
Trialling a ‘one bin for all plastics’ system
Our research involved trialling a ‘one bin for all plastics’ system, which saw 30 households get a separate bin for all of their plastic waste for a two-week period.
This allowed the project team to explore how consumers engage with recycling, and showed that the blame levelled against households for poor quality recycling is largely misplaced.
Indeed, most households are eager to do the right thing, with numerous respondents demonstrating a willingness to go above and beyond to correctly dispose of their plastic.
So, what needs to change to make sure their efforts don’t go to waste?
Low recycling rates are driven by confusion over rules
The research found that the key driver of low recycling rates is confusion over rules as to what can and can’t be thrown away – and with an estimated 39 differing bin regimes currently in place across the UK, as well as 3,500 waste recycling plants with varying capabilities in infrastructure, it’s understandable why.
Described as a ‘postcode lottery’, this siloed and fragmented system has caused a lack of clarity over correct procedure, whilst the inability of some local authorities to process certain plastics holds back consumers from recycling what may be possible to recycle elsewhere.
Introducing a standardised approach to plastic recycling
A first step in tackling this would involve the adoption of a standardised approach to plastic recycling, to allow for a consistent method of waste management across the country.
Two years ago, the government outlined plans to do just that, by introducing nationwide consistency in recycling standards by October this year. However, in a new ‘waste prevention programme’ published in July, officials quietly confirmed that consistent recycling collections would be delayed until late 2025.
This is a huge blow. Introducing recycling consistency could create a platform on which the government can begin to effectively deliver the transition towards a circular economy of plastic waste, and these plans should be prioritised rather than kicked further down the road.
Crucially, it is worth noting that the onus does not lie solely on government or local authorities. Consistency in collection can only be truly effective if packaging designers and plastic producers adopt a large-scale, standardised approach to manufacturing.
Multi-material packaging is much harder to recycle
The 30 households involved in the ‘One Bin’ project trial disposed of a total of 5,800 pieces of plastic over the two-week trial period. Of this total, nearly half of the items collected consisted of multi-material packaging.
Made up of a combination of materials, these are much harder to recycle, with their inconsistency in composition meaning that a lot more plastic ends up in the general bin instead of being collected for reuse.
Maximising the recycling of such materials will involve simplifying their design and disposal. In this regard, delivering any real change would require broad adoption across sectors. This may take some time to co-ordinate, but it would pay dividends by increasing the amount of high-quality recycled plastic that can be used in packaging moving forward.
The research shows the willingness for change amongst consumers, but we need to ensure the infrastructure is in place to support this. The issue can no longer be ignored if the UK is to truly achieve its sustainability goals.

https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/developing-responsible-sources-of-magnet-metals-at-the-monte-muambe-project/38352/,Developing responsible magnet metals at the Monte Muambe project,"Altona Rare Earths tell us about the state of magnet metals and provides an update on their Monte Muambe project.
Rare earths are a group of 17 chemical elements. Each of these elements has its own properties, uses, and prices. Among other uses, four elements – neodymium, praseodymium, terbium, and dysprosium, collectively known as the ‘magnet metals’ – are necessary for the manufacturing of high-performance permanent magnets.
By volume, permanent magnets represent about 50% of the world’s rare earth consumption. By value, they represent more than 95%.
Ryan Castilloux, the founder of Adamas Intelligence, recently revealed that nine out of ten electric vehicles (EV) deployed during September 2023 were permanent magnet synchronous motors or magnet-assisted synchronous reluctant motors. Both types contain rare earth magnets.
The same company forecasts that the current supply deficit of neodymium-praseodymium oxide will grow from a few thousand tons currently to 90,000 tons per year by 2040.
Magnet metals are already an essential raw material for many industrial and high-technology applications. They are critical to the decarbonisation of the world’s energy sources through the production of EV drive trains and wind turbines. While alternatives exist, these have drawbacks in terms of performance and cost that make them second choices.
The share of EV and wind turbines in the consumption of magnet metals is set to grow during the next decades, driven by the green energy transition and policy changes aimed at implementing it.
Altona Rare Earths’ acquisition strategy
Altona Rare Earths is a British mineral resources exploration and development company specialised in rare earths and focussed on Africa. The company joined the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange on 9 June 2023.
Altona Rare Earths started to implement its rare earths project acquisition strategy in early 2020 and reviewed different projects in various African jurisdictions, applying its strict selection criteria.
In 2021, the company settled on the Monte Muambe carbonatite-hosted rare earths deposit, located in the Tete Province in the Northwest part of Mozambique. The project now has a maiden JORC Mineral Resource Estimate published, and a Scoping Study will soon be completed.
Taking advantage of its position in Africa, its networks, and its knowledge of the African continent’s geology, Altona Rare Earths continues to assess new potential project acquisition opportunities and expects to add at least one other rare earths project to its portfolio over the next year.
Africa’s geological history
The African continent has a long and complex geological history, which has been favourable to the development of rare earth deposits over time. The crustal abundance of rare earths is of the same order of magnitude as that of metals such as copper, vanadium, and lead.
However, economically viable concentrations are rare, and they are found in very different geological environments.
The main sources of rare earths are carbonatites, ionic clay deposits, and heavy mineral sands. The grade of rare earth deposits is expressed as total rare earth oxide (TREO), either as a percentage or in parts per million (ppm).
Ionic clay deposits typically have a low grade, usually ranging from 500 to 2,000 ppm TREO (0.05 to 0.2% TREO), which is compensated for by lower development and exploitation costs, and they can be exploited on a small scale. Carbonatite deposits such as Monte Muambe have higher grades, typically ranging from 1-10% TREO, but have higher development and exploitation costs.
Assessing a rare earths project is difficult
Rare earth projects are relatively new to the mining industry. Production currently originates mostly from a few carbonatite mines in China, one in Australia, and one in the United States, as well as a flurry of small-scale ionic clay deposits in Southeast China and neighbouring countries.
Therefore, when benchmarking a rare earths project, it is difficult to compare with existing operations, and comparisons are more easily made with advanced projects at the definitive feasibility study stage.
However, the complexity of rare earth deposits is such that every deposit is different in terms of geology, mineralogy, metallurgy, and costs. Therefore, comparisons also have their limitations.
While assessing a rare earths project, it is also important to distinguish between mineral resources, which represent the quantity of minerals contained in the ground, from ore reserves, which show the quantity of minerals viably extractable, as demonstrated in a feasibility study.
For example, mineral resource statements for carbonatite rare earth deposits can reach several hundreds of millions of tons, but the ore reserve statements for such projects rarely exceed 30 million tons.
An update on the Monte Muambe project
Since 2021, Altona Rare Earths has carried out several drilling campaigns at Monte Muambe, as well as soil sampling and ground geophysical surveys. Over 100 boreholes have been drilled for a total of more than 7,800m. This focused exploration work has allowed the company to discover and define two significant orebodies, referred to as Target 1 and Target 4.
On 25 September 2023, Altona Rare Earths announced its maiden JORC Mineral Resource Estimate for the Monte Muambe project, totalling 13.6 million tons at 2.42% TREO. This includes 45,000 tons of Magnet Metals oxides. This result provides a solid base for a mining project, and the tonnage is expected to increase through additional drilling during the pre-feasibility study without reducing the grade.
Importantly, about 58% of the resource’s tonnage belongs to the Indicated category (the rest being inferred), which demonstrates a high level of confidence in the resource figures. This is in line with the company’s strategy to avoid ‘drilling for numbers’ and rather to focus on defining the mineral resources that can be converted into an ore reserve and ultimately into a mining operation, from the onset.
So far, the Monte Muambe project ticks all the boxes of a low strip ratio open-pit mining operation.
Altona Rare Earths is now about to publish a scoping study, which will give a first pass test of economic viability for the project. The completion of this important milestone will allow Altona Rare Earths to increase its holding of the project to 51%, thus further de-risking the project for its shareholders.
The new challenges of the supply chain
While about 40% of rare earths mining is done outside of China, this country clearly dominates the supply chain, with over 90% of the separation, refining, and conversion of oxide to metal and magnet manufacturing being done in China. The country has heavily invested over the past 30 years, both domestically and abroad, to create this dominance. This has created a situation of dependence on China for other nations, not just for the supply of permanent magnets and EVs but also for critical high-technology applications such as within the communications and defence industries.
Western countries have recently started to recognise this situation and its associated risks, and are reacting by putting in place policies to develop domestic, or at least China-independent, supply chains for rare earths and other critical minerals. Rare earth processing facilities are starting to appear outside of China and will reduce the reliance on China. These changes will take time but will happen. They will, in our opinion, ultimately lead to the integration of Chinese and non-Chinese supply chains rather than their separation and to a more balanced market with more stable rare earths prices.
However, developing rare earth mines in the West, such as Europe, is proving to be a lot more difficult. This is because there are not many mineable rare earth deposits in Europe and also because the regulatory and social environment in Europe has, over time, become very adverse to mining.
The role of African, Asian, and South American countries hosting rare earths and other critical mineral resources will become essential to ensuring supplies of rare earths to both Chinese and non-Chinese markets. Africa has a long history of producing raw minerals, which have been exported to be processed and transformed in other countries. There is a strong sentiment in Africa that this must stop. Several countries have put in place bans on raw mineral products exports.
It is essential for mineral project developers to take this changing environment into consideration and integrate in-country value addition as much as possible. This is best done by starting to assess opportunities for value addition at an early stage in the life of projects rather than when reaching the final stages of the feasibility studies.
However, ultimately, the viability of a project depends on whether it can be economically implemented or not. African Governments therefore have a duty to put in place favourable conditions and lift obstacles to such value addition projects.
Another important angle in the developing rare earths supply chains is that of responsible sourcing. Western supply chains typically want to be able to guarantee to their customers, especially the end consumers, that the raw materials used to manufacture products have been extracted with no harm to people or the environment.
Responsible sourcing systems have previously been put in place, with more-or-less success, for minerals such as diamond or columbo-tantalite. Responsible sourcing is bound to become a topic of major importance in the development of critical minerals supply chains. Large and well-managed rare earth projects such as Monte Muambe can be certified and audited by responsible sourcing organisations, contrary to Southeast China artisan ionic clay operations, which are very environmentally destructive.
The outlook for 2024 at Monte Muambe
Buoyed by a rare earths market with solid long-term fundamentals and highly encouraging exploration results at Monte Muambe, including the recently published mineral resource estimate, Altona Rare Earths looks forward to a busy 2024 with the preparation of a pre-feasibility study for Monte Muambe.
A lot of emphasis will be put on the metallurgy part of the project and fine-tuning the process flow chart.
The increase of the company’s holding in the project to 51%, as well as securing a mining concession, are also important milestones that will happen during this time frame and will contribute greatly to de-risking Monte Muambe.

https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/navigating-turbulent-waters-modern-cyber-security-threats/38374/,Navigating the turbulent waters of modern cyber security threats,"Kamal Srinivasan, SVP of Product and Program Management at Parallels (part of Alludo), explains that technological advances require new approaches to dealing with cyber security threats.
“The only constant in life is change.” I’m very sure that when Heraclitus said this, he was not referring to the ever-changing cyber security landscape. But had he been, he would have been spot on. In the rapidly evolving technological realm of cyber security, the conventional approach to addressing cyber security threats that businesses face is no longer sufficient.
With the increased reliance upon technology to help businesses meet their internal and external goals, there is a necessity for a more robust and adaptive approach towards cyber security.
According to a recent survey by Alludo – in partnership with Qualtrics, featuring nearly 500 IT professionals, eight out of ten respondents stated that security is a top priority. Even still, with this increased importance placed upon cyber security, there were more than 79 million breached records in August alone.
It’s clear to see that the desire is there from companies to attack cyber security threats head-on, yet still, it wouldn’t be out of the ordinary to wonder why many cyber security breaches take place.
Technology is evolving faster than ever before
From cloud computing to Artificial Intelligence, the recent developments made in technology have led businesses from numerous sectors to implement new technologies to improve all aspects of business operations and customer satisfaction.
However, whilst doing this, reaping the benefits and capabilities of these technological advancements, they also at times inadvertently leave themselves exposed to cyber security threats.
An increased demand from both customers and employees for a more contactless on-demand experience has led businesses to invest in technology to meet both parties’ desires. At an ever-growing rate, cloud computing is being adopted to make data more readily available when customers and employees desire it.
41.4% of IT leaders reported that they were increasing their use of the cloud. A further 32.8% announced they were migrating on-premises workloads to the cloud.
This sudden shift to the cloud has undeniably improved operations for businesses from a productivity, flexibility, and collaborative standpoint.
Nevertheless, it has also left behind traditional security enterprise controls, rooted in the firewall-centric approach, making it increasingly more apparent that such and often used cyber security approaches can’t keep up with the new dynamic landscape.
There is no denying that in the future, the cloud will become more prominent in the way that businesses operate. Although IT decision-makers from businesses may be reluctant to do so, it is time to let go of the old and outdated cyber security measures and put in place newer approaches such as the Zero-Trust Architecture (ZTA). This approach operates under the principles that all entities are untrusted by default, least privileged access is enforced, and comprehensive security monitoring is implemented as is a core foundational requirement of secure remote access.
A ZTA approach challenges traditional thought processes and ways of working by assuming ‘trust in good, but control is better.’ This means that no user or system should be inherently trusted, no matter their location within or outside the network. Addressing the limitations of traditional enterprise controls and extending protective measures beyond the typical boundaries.
Double trouble: Tackling dual cyber security threats in a connected world
If the last few years have shown business leaders and IT decision-makers anything it’s that the future is unpredictable. Take the most conventional form of working now. No one would have thought that 47% of all workers would be hybrid and a further 11% were fully remote before the pandemic. But that’s where we currently find ourselves today.
The increase in employees working from both a hybrid and remote capacity though has had positives, it has also increased the chances of businesses falling victim to cyber security threats from a dual perspective. It shouldn’t be a surprise that with all the potential security threats out there such as phishing attacks, organisations plan to increase their security expenditures. 78% of IT leaders reported that they planned to up their security budgets either moderately or significantly in the coming year.
As all professional sectors increasingly become interconnected and work no longer has to be confined specifically to one place, it wouldn’t be a surprise if mobile devices and cloud computing become integral components of business operations. If they’re not already.
Bearing all of this in mind, businesses must invest in the necessary technologies such as remote application servers and remote browser isolation to deal with both external cyber security threats whilst employees work away from home.
In tandem with implementing the necessary technology, businesses should also implement a culture where all decisions by employees relating to data take into consideration the cyber security risks. Having principles as such whilst leveraging the right technology, gives businesses the best chance of not falling victim to cyber attacks.
The battle in the landscape will be continuous
According to IT professionals, the top three external threats to sensitive data in their organisations were malware and ransomware attacks (64%), cloud vulnerabilities (42%), and phishing attacks (38%). This isn’t a surprise considering the fact the dependability that has been placed on certain technologies such as the cloud.
But with the increased developments in other areas within the technological landscape, such as in AI, it wouldn’t be surprising if new avenues and loopholes arise for cyber attacks to take place.
So even though 59% of IT leaders have not experienced a security breach, organisations should not rest on their laurels. In today’s reality of hybrid and remote work, along with technological developments means that organisations must be forever alert and take a holistic approach to cyber security to adapt to the ever-changing landscape.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/shutterstockGorodenkoff_2136788157.jpg,2023-10-18 07:52:54

The technological transformation effectively futureproofs the company, with further functional changes easier to implement and benefits reaped by agents through easier access to more accurate data, reduced downtime and quicker responses.
The company has refactored all visible channels – including its websites – which are now device agnostic. The changes are driving tangible increase in booking conversion and have been achieved for a capital expenditure of €11 million.
Ecosystem creation
HBX Group is an ecosystem player within the world of travel. By combining the company’s four pillars – making up the “X” – technology, data, product and people, HBX Group is better-placed to support its clients and partners by offering the full scope of travel products, including ancillary services, and selling them in one package. It also encompasses the multiplier effect businesses that choose to work with the Group will benefit from.
“Being an ecosystem player enables us to provide our customers with interconnected products and services, which complement each other and which, when combined and sold seamlessly together, gives our clients what they want, when they want it.” adds Nicolas Huss. “It also streamlines the buying process while enabling clients to upsell ancillary products, enhancing their business and providing frictionless travel to the end consumer.”
Supporting the transition into an ecosystem player, Hotelbeds’ accommodation, mobility and attractions sales teams have been brought together as part of the new Group infrastructure, enabling them to cross-sell all product lines and streamline client relationships as they will now have one point of contact for all sales activity.
New fintech solutions
As part of the evolution to HBX Group, the company will introduce fintech products in 2024, including travel insurance, payment solutions, and multi-currency solutions. These products will be embedded into the company’s core business to offer its clients and partners these services across their total business volumes.
The size of these opportunities is already large and growing. For example the travel insurance sector alone is currently worth €15 billion and is expected to grow to €99bn by 2030, according to research by Spherical Insights & Consulting.
“As travellers increasingly seek the connected trip experience with all aspects of their travel included in the same ticket, we must ensure we’re meeting this need through travel insurance and associated financial products,” added Nicolas Huss. “We have offered hotels since our inception in 2001, later adding car hire, transfers and attractions. Financial services are the natural next step in our business development and one our clients have asked us to provide.”

https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-reveals-its-making-a-risc-v-chip-for-android-wearables-124002464.html,Qualcomm reveals it's making a RISC-V chip for Android wearables,"Qualcomm is working with Google to develop a RISC-V platform that can power Wear OS devices. RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA), which Arm describes as ""part of the abstract model of a computer that defines how the CPU is controlled by the software."" Since it's open standard, it could lead to open-source chip designs and could lower the costs for companies that want to build their own chips. That means more companies entering the industry and more devices on the market, which could foster innovation and give rise to more affordable options.
Google came out in support of RISC-V earlier this year in hopes that it could compete on equal footing with Arm one day. However, the technology still has a long way to go to reach that status. According to Ars Technica, Qualcomm's could be the first mass-market RISC-V Android chip ever, if all goes according to plan. As the publication notes, a RISC-V platform represents a big threat to Arm, whose CPU architecture dominates the smartphone industry. Things had been pretty unsteady for Arm over the past couple of years, with its parent company Softbank trying to sell it to NVIDIA until regulators stepped in and prevented the acquisition from happening. The company ended up registering for a US IPO instead and raised $4.87 billion in September.
In its announcement, the chipmaker said its RISC-V Snapdragon Wear platform will power the next generation of Wear OS devices. It's planning to commercialize the technology for wearable products meant for global release, but it doesn't have a launch date yet. Qualcomm said it has already started the new chip's development and will be sharing more information about its timeline at a later date.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8gKFStL0R_uuQ0fbj4nrIw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MzQ-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/345e9340-31e1-11ee-bdff-f26414cd25dd,2023-10-18 12:40:02
https://interestingengineering.com/science/4000-genomes-from-40000-years-tracing-neanderthal-dna-in-eurasians,"4,000 genomes from 40,000 years: Tracing Neanderthal DNA in Eurasians","Neanderthal genes can be found in the DNA of certain modern humans.Genetic studies have revealed interbreeding between modern humans (Homo sapiens) and Neanderthals (Homo neanderthalensis) tens of thousands of years ago.Interbreeding happened around 40,000 years ago when Homo sapiens from Africa traveled to the western portions of the Eurasian continent.Neanderthals had already inhabited the western Eurasian continent for thousands of years before this encounter.A study led by the University of Geneva has examined the distribution of the Neanderthal-inherited DNA segments within the genomes of humans.This new research might help us better grasp the shared history of these two species.The modern Eurasian populations have some two percent of their DNA derived from Neanderthal ancestors.The recent study highlights that this minor Neanderthal DNA component exhibits slight variations across different Eurasian regions. Neanderthal DNA appears more abundant in Asian people's genomes than in European populations. “In the case of Sapiens and Neanderthals, the hypothesis is that the further one moves away from Africa, Homo sapiens’ point of origin, the greater the proportion of DNA from Neanderthal, a population mainly located in Europe,” noted the press release.The team investigated this theory with the help of a comprehensive genome database provided by Harvard Medical School. The database contains almost 4,000 genomes from people living in Eurasia for the last 40,000 years. This study mainly examined the genomes of European populations. Statistical analyses of the genomes revealed exciting insights about the genetic variation.It found that when Homo sapiens left Africa, Paleolithic hunter-gatherers in Europe had somewhat more Neanderthal DNA than those in Asia. As the Neolithic era began 10,000 to 5,000 years ago, there was a drop in Neanderthal DNA in European populations, which was lower than in Asian ones. This period represents the shift from the hunter-gatherer to the agricultural lifestyle.This decline coincided with the arrival of the first farmers from Anatolia (Turkey’s western peninsula) and the Aegean area, who carried less Neanderthal DNA. Their intermixing with European populations further decreased the prevalence of Neanderthal DNA in European genomes.“We are beginning to have enough data to describe more and more precisely the percentage of DNA of Neanderthal origin in the genome of Sapiens at certain periods of prehistory. Our work can, therefore, serve as a reference for future studies to more easily detect genetic profiles that deviate from the average and might, therefore, disclose an advantageous or disadvantageous effect,’’ concluded Mathias Currat, one of the study's authors.Studying early human genes could provide insights into our evolutionary history, helping experts trace the origins and development of the human species.The findings were published in the journal Science Advances.

https://interestingengineering.com/transportation/berge-bulks-berge-olympus-wind-power,Berge Bulk's Berge Olympus: A wind-powered marvel for greener oceans,"Berge Bulk, a prominent dry bulk shipping industry player, has officially unveiled its latest creation – the Berge Olympus. This Newcastlemax bulker is set to revolutionize the world of cargo shipping, the company announced. At its heart lies a groundbreaking innovation – four BARTech WindWings by Yara Marine Technologies, massive sails designed to harness the power of the wind and significantly reduce fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.The Berge Olympus, equipped with these colossal WindWings, is set to embark on a remarkable journey between Brazil and China, a trade route well-known for its favorable wind conditions. With each WindWing measuring 20 meters in width and 37.5 meters in height, these rigid sails dwarf even the wings of the largest passenger aircraft globally, the A380, boasting a total surface area of 3,000 square meters, more than three times that of the massive airplane.The environmental impact of this innovative technology is equally impressive. On an average global route, the Berge Olympus is projected to save a remarkable 6 tonnes of fuel daily, translating into a 20 percent reduction in fuel consumption while concurrently slashing CO2 emissions by approximately 19.5 tonnes each day. These statistics are a testament to Berge Bulk's commitment to sustainability and a significant contribution to the industry's mission to reduce carbon intensity as per the new IMO regulations.James Marshall, CEO of Berge Bulk, expressed the company's dedication to reducing its environmental footprint and added, ""At Berge Bulk, we are constantly striving to enhance our efficiency and reduce the environmental impact of our existing fleet. From 2008 until today, we have achieved a remarkable 46 percent reduction in our CO2 emissions per tonne mile, already surpassing the 2030 IMO target for reducing carbon emissions intensity.""Marshall further highlighted the need to accelerate the transition to zero-carbon fuels and applauded the collaboration with BAR Technologies and Yara Marine Technologies, the masterminds behind the WindWing system. The Berge Olympus, he remarked, stands as a testament to innovation and sustainability.This remarkable project from Berge Bulk aligns seamlessly with the company's ambition to achieve carbon neutrality by 2025. It falls under the company's four-pillar decarbonization plan, dubbed the ""Marshall Plan."" This strategic approach focuses on enhancing fleet efficiency, embracing cutting-edge maritime technology, experimenting with new fuels, and investing in carbon capture technologies.The WindWing installation on the Berge Olympus is a monumental step towards meeting these goals, and it has already proven its effectiveness in real-world applications. The WindWings' debut on the M/V Pyxis Ocean, an 80,000-ton bulk carrier chartered by Cargill, marked a milestone. The Pyxis Ocean, belonging to MC Shipping, a Mitsubishi Corp. subsidiary, completed its maiden voyage from Shanghai to Singapore with two WindWings, demonstrating the feasibility and potential of this technology.Thomas Koniordos, CEO of Yara Marine Technologies, emphasized the significance of wind-assisted propulsion in achieving net-zero emissions in the shipping industry. He stated, ""Wind-assisted propulsion has the potential to offer immediate long-term solutions for shipping's pathway to Net Zero."" Furthermore, he expressed pride in collaborating with Berge Bulk and reaffirmed their commitment to scaling this technology to meet industry demand.In addition to the WindWings, the Berge Olympus is equipped with a shaft generator system driven by the main engine. This innovative system supplies electric power to the vessel and eliminates the need for auxiliary engines while at sea, resulting in further fuel savings and reduced emissions. It is a groundbreaking development that brings Berge Bulk closer to achieving its ambitious sustainability goals.The launch of the Berge Olympus represents a giant leap towards a more sustainable and environmentally friendly future for the shipping industry. With its WindWings and innovative technologies, Berge Bulk is setting new standards and leading the charge toward a carbon-neutral future in maritime transportation.

https://interestingengineering.com/military/russia-withdrawal-nuclear-testing-treaty,"Russia reverses course on nuclear test ban, raising global concern","Russia has reportedly begun the process of withdrawing from ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).State Duma, the country's lower house of the Federal Assembly, voted on Tuesday to revoke Moscow's ratification of the global treaty that prohibits nuclear tests, according to some US media reports.This has left international advocates for arms control concerned, even though Russian authorities claim to remain committed to the treaty's goals.""We are not yet in a terrible place, but we are in a bad place,"" Andrey Baklitskiy, a senior researcher at the UN Institute for Disarmament Research in Geneva, Switzerland, told National Public Radio (NPR) news.The goal of the CTBT, passed by the UN General Assembly in 1996, is to outlaw all nuclear blasts, including for peaceful and hostile reasons.The pact has been ratified by 170 countries and signed by 185, except for a few key countries such as the United States, China, and North Korea.Russian action has led to worries that the delicate balance of international nuclear security may be slipping.Some see the withdrawal of ratification as a significant step backward in the direction of global efforts to reduce the threat of nuclear proliferation.The withdrawal procedure has not yet reached its ultimate phase, calling for a string of successive votes.However, its ramifications have already started to ripple across the worldwide political scene, spurring urgent conversations about the necessity of maintaining and bolstering global arms control agreements among significant parties.The United States has signed but never ratified the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was ratified by Russia in 2000.President Vladimir Putin gave the Duma a clue weeks ago when he stated that the goal of de-ratifying would be to ""mirror"" the American attitude, Reuters reported earlier this month.""For 23 years we have been waiting for Washington to ratify the treaty. What is this? Double standards, meanness, and an irresponsible attitude. There is no other name for it,""  claimed Vyacheslav Volodin, Duma speaker.""In this situation, we must be guided exclusively by the interests of the citizens of our country, our state.""Putin stated earlier that the country's ""tit-for-tat"" relations with the United States were a factor in the de-ratification of the treaty banning nuclear tests.The Russian President pointed out that new nuclear weapons are being developed in Russia and that the country may decide to test them.""There is this tendency in the last couple of years that Russia wants to have everything the U.S. has,"" according to Andrey Baklitskiy.Historically, Russia has conducted nuclear weapons tests on Novaya Zemlya, a remote territory in the Arctic.Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, US, claims that satellite photography reveals a significant amount of renewed activity at the site.A group overseeing the Test Ban Treaty has promised to keep the international nuclear monitoring apparatus operating on Russian soil. Meanwhile, 32 of the 321 monitoring stations that make up the international test monitoring network are still run by Russia, and many of these stations are essential for keeping track of events in politically sensitive regions including North Korea, China, and Iran.

https://interestingengineering.com/science/energy-crisis-iea-directs-for-50-million-miles-of-new-power-lines,Energy crisis: IEA directs for 50 million miles of new power lines,"The world needs to act fast to improve and expand its electricity grids or risk facing a climate catastrophe and frequent blackouts, a new report by the IEA, aka The International Energy Agency, said recently.Electricity grids are the lifelines of modern societies, powering homes, factories, offices, and hospitals. They are also crucial for the transition to clean energy, as more and more electricity comes from solar, wind, and other low-carbon sources. However, the report titled Electricity Grids and Secure Energy Transitions found that grids must catch up with the pace of change and innovation in the energy sector.The report warned that grids could become a bottleneck for deploying renewables and electrifying transport and heating without more investment and policy support. This could jeopardize the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 °C and threaten energy security.To meet all national climate and energy targets, the world will need to add or replace 50 million miles (roughly converted from 80 million kilometers) of power lines by 2040 – the same as the length of the existing grid. By 2030, the operation and regulation of grids will require significant reforms, and annual investment in grids will need to be doubled to over USD 600 billion.Sources: IEA analysis The report also highlighted the growing backlog of renewables projects waiting to be connected to the grid. It is estimated that there are 1,500 gigawatts of solar PV and wind projects in advanced stages of development – enough to power over a billion homes – but they are stuck in limbo due to grid constraints.IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol stated that the world is experiencing an unparalleled clean energy transition. However, he warned that this could be at risk unless immediate action is taken to improve our electricity grids. Birol emphasized the importance of investing in grids to avoid potential gridlock and guarantee a stable and sustainable energy future. He also cautioned that failing to invest in grids could result in a much higher cost in the future.The report also stressed the importance of grids for coping with the rising demand for electricity as more people switch to electric cars and heat pumps. These new technologies can help reduce emissions but also require more power lines and innovative distribution networks to ensure reliable supplies. The report also called for more flexibility in grids, such as through demand response and energy storage, to balance the variability of solar and wind power.The report presented a new scenario called the Grid Delay Case, which showed the consequences of failing to upgrade grids in time. It projected that CO2 emissions from the power sector would be almost 60 billion tonnes higher between 2030 and 2050 due to a slower expansion of renewables and a higher reliance on fossil fuels. This would make it impossible to achieve the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 °C and increase the likelihood of exceeding two °C by 40%.The report also suggested some strategic actions that can help improve grids, such as building more cross-border and regional interconnections to share power across different areas and increase resilience. It also urged countries to integrate more solar and wind power into their grids by adopting best practices and standards for grid planning, operation, and regulation.The report urged governments to back large-scale transmission projects to ensure that grids are prepared for further strong growth in renewable power. It also encouraged grid developers and operators to embrace digitalization to make future grids more resilient and flexible.Given the long lead times for modernizing and extending grids, the report emphasized the urgency of taking action. It said that new grid infrastructure often takes 5 to 15 years to plan, permit, and complete – compared with 1 to 5 years for new renewables projects and less than two years for new charging infrastructure for electric vehicles.The report also called for more vital international collaboration to improve and expand grid infrastructure in countries worldwide. It noted that emerging and developing economies, excluding China, have seen a decline in grid investments in recent years despite robust electricity demand growth and ongoing efforts to meet energy access goals.The report quoted Birol as saying that ensuring the developing world has the resources it needs to build and modernize electricity grids is essential for the international community. He said that by mobilizing financing, providing access to technology, and sharing best practices on policies, leading economies can help improve people’s lives, strengthen sustainable development, and reduce the risks of climate change.

https://interestingengineering.com/military/insitu-pacific-innovaero-australian-uas,New all-Australian UAS-loitering munition tag team announced,"Two Australian companies, Innovaero and Boeing subsidiary Insitu Pacific (IPL), intend to collaborate to develop a new loitering munition and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) combination for the Australian Department of Defense. The new system will provide Australia with a long-range strike capability using uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS). The combination includes IPL's ""Integrator"" ISR UAS and Perth-based Innovaero’s ""One-Way Loitering"" (OWL) munition.“This unified approach would combine uncrewed intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and long-range strike capabilities to rapidly deliver direct effects in the engagement zone without the need for crews in larger air assets being put at risk,” said Andrew Duggan, Managing Director of Insitu Pacific in a press release. “The concept is designed to achieve seamless integration with current Australian Defence Force systems, including the Integrator, and offers great potential to become an integral strike asset,"" he added. The IPL ""Integrator"" is, according to IPL, an advanced version of the UAS and is designed to provide Group 4 and 5 capabilities in a Group 3 UAS. According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FDA), ""Groups 4 and 5 are the largest of DoD UAS, weighing over 1,320 pounds [(598 kg)] and operating at all speeds and altitudes. Group 4 aircraft operate at all altitudes, usually below 18,000 feet [(5,486 meters), mean sea level (MSL)]. Group 5 aircraft typically operate well above 18,000 feet MSL."" Group 3 are UAS that weigh more than 55 pounds [(25 kg)] and less than 1,320 pounds, operate below 18,000 feet, and have a top speed of 250 knots (463 kph). With the addition of satellite-enabled beyond line of sight (SATCOM BLOS), the ""Integrator"" UAS is capable of extended ranges that can help reduce logistical challenges and improve the safety of field personnel. According to IPL, ""Integrator"" has over one million operational hours of experience, making it one of the most innovative and reliable unmanned aircraft systems available in the industry today.Innovaero's ""OWL,"" developed in collaboration with BAE Systems Australia, is an electrically-powered munition with a maximum range of nearly 124 miles (200 km). It can loiter at a range of 62 miles (100 km) for up to 30 minutes. According to Innovaero, precision targeting of stationary and moving targets is achieved using an electro-optical/infrared camera. Additionally, it has a range of anti-armor and fragmentation warheads that can weigh up to 15 pounds (7 kg).""Together, the companies will develop, test, and field the collaborative system using Insitu Pacific’s common ground control station (GCS) and INEXA software to control UAS and long-range OWLs. Operators would command both assets through the common GCS,"" explains Innovaero. The announcement strengthens the partnership between Insitu Pacific and Innovaero to develop Australian technology for uncrewed aerial systems, as outlined in a Memorandum of Agreement established in July 2021.“The versatility of the proposed combined ISR and strike solution provides a significantly shorter ‘sensor to shooter’ loop to engage emerging threats,” said Simon Grosser, Innovaero Group CEO. “Our collaboration with Insitu Pacific builds on our work with Defence in Australia to develop an Australian loitering munitions capability and offers an integrated solution for long-range UAS target detection and effective engagement,"" he added. Development and testing for the Integrator/OWL system will continue through 2023.

https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/breakthrough-mini-device-converts-molecular-movement-into-electricity,Breakthrough: Mini device converts molecular movement into electricity,"Energy is a critical component of modern human civilization, supplying electricity to houses, factories, and transportation. As the world's population and demands grow, sustainable energy sources and efficient use become critical for the long-term future.In a major development, a tiny device has harnessed the motion of molecules in room-temperature liquid to generate electricity.This innovative technological solution promises to create a clean and readily available energy source for low-power devices, entirely self-sufficient and not reliant on any external energy sources.As per the New Scientist report, this device may find applications in energizing items such as tiny medical implants and even small household gadgets in the future. Molecules are constantly in motion because they have thermal energy — even when they seem stationary to our eyes.For instance, even though a glass of water appears to be still, the individual water molecules continually vibrate and clash with one another, resulting in this seemingly undetectable motion. This underlying molecular mobility is a basic property of matter at every temperature above absolute zero.“We thought it would be interesting and meaningful to see if this motion can be harvested and converted into electricity,” Wei Li at Nankai University in China told New Scientist. The study team created a small energy-harvesting device that is only one square centimeter, called a molecular thermal motion harvester (MTMH). This device has two electrodes, one on top and one on the bottom, each having several 25-nanometer-wide strands of zinc oxide attached to it. Reportedly, zinc oxide was chosen as the material because of its ability to generate an electrical charge when mechanically deformed.The harvesting device was then placed in a container filled with n-octane – a hydrocarbon comparable to propane or butane but with a longer chain of carbon and hydrogen atoms. This process occurred at room temperature.APL materials The experiment results indicated that when the molecules in the liquid came into contact with the microscopic zinc oxide strands, they generated a small voltage of 2.28 millivolts and a current of 2.47 nanoamperes.“The energy of the thermal motion of octane can be converted into electrical energy through the device based on the piezoelectric properties of ZnO and a nano-array structure,” mentioned the study. The team also aims to examine whether different solvents or liquids can efficiently serve as power sources for this device.The researchers believe the gadget might provide energy for nano-scale devices such as implants for medicine delivery and therapeutic purposes. The team hopes to advance this technology further to power more complex applications with high efficiency. The results were reported in the journal APL Materials.Study abstract: Molecular thermal motion has been studied yet never utilized as an energy source. In this work, we demonstrate that the energy of liquid molecular thermal motion can be converted into electrical energy by a novel harvesting device, the molecular thermal motion harvester (MTMH). The MTMH was made by using two ZnO-based nano-arrays and one of which was gold coated to form a Schottky junction. The assembled electrodes were immersed in different liquid phase environments. The device was demonstrated to convert the molecule thermal energy of the liquid into a continuous and stable electric current. The output voltage and current can achieve 2.28 mV and 2.47 nA, respectively, and increase with the liquid temperatures. This strategy opens new insights into the development of mini- and micro-scale energy sources, and it can be expected the MTMH will have broad applications in the future.

https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/undersea-cables-reshape-earthquake-preparedness,How old undersea cables could reshape earthquake preparedness,"A new study has found a way to use old telecom cables lying under the sea as earthquake sensors, which could save precious seconds in warning people of impending tremors. The researchers used a method called Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) to turn 31 miles (50 kilometers) of fiber optic cable between the US and Chile into thousands of seismic detectors.The study, published in The Seismic Record, was led by Jiuxun Yin, a former Caltech researcher who now works at SLB. He and his colleagues analyzed the seismic data from 8,960 channels along the cable for four days and detected three earthquakes, one on land and two in the ocean.They found that the offshore DAS array could improve the earthquake early warning (EEW) by about three seconds compared to the onshore DAS arrays. They also simulated how multiple offshore DAS arrays spaced 31 miles (50 kilometers) apart could work together to reduce the EEW alert time by five seconds in the subduction zone, where one tectonic plate slides under another.Yin said that the offshore location of the DAS array was the critical advantage, as it eliminated the delay caused by the seismic waves traveling to the land-based stations. He said they were surprised by how much faster the offshore DAS array was than their initial expectations.TSR doi.org/10.1785/0320230018 The study focused on the region off the coast of Chile, which is prone to powerful and frequent earthquakes due to its active subduction zone. The same is true for the Cascadia region off Canada, the US Pacific Northwest, and even Southern California, where many faults have produced strong quakes. In these densely populated coastal areas, offshore EEW could help save lives and property from earthquake damage.Yin explained that they chose the cable off Chile because of its high seismic risk. He said Chile had witnessed several devastating earthquakes of magnitude eight or more in history, including the largest one ever recorded in 1960. He said there was an urgent need for a reliable offshore EEW system in Chile.The researchers used a deep-learning artificial intelligence model to identify the earthquake waves from the DAS data of the offshore cable. Yin said this was a fast and efficient option for real-time applications like EEW, as DAS data was vast in volume. He added, however, that other traditional seismological methods could also work well with DAS data with automation.Yin also revealed that there were more than 1,500 cable landing stations around the globe and that the progress in the technology allowed them to use operational cables and add DAS systems without affecting data transportation. He expressed his belief that this opened up many exciting research opportunities and that he and his colleagues were eager to explore them in future studies. He said they sought close interactions with cable owners, environmental agencies, and policymakers to scale up the DAS-EEW to benefit coastal communities.Yin said more data from significant earthquakes was needed to develop and test EEW algorithms effectively. More information is needed on how DAS instruments behave before building a real-time EEW system that integrates with existing EEW frameworks.He said there were many places worldwide where this research could be continued and expanded.The study was published in The Seismic RecordStudy abstract:We present a real‐data test for offshore earthquake early warning (EEW) with distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) by transforming submarine fiber‐optic cable into a dense seismic array. First, we constrain earthquake locations using the arrival‐time information recorded by the DAS array. Second, with site effects along the cable calibrated using an independent earthquake, we estimate earthquake magnitudes directly from strain rate amplitudes by applying a scaling relation transferred from onshore DAS arrays. Our results indicate that using this single 50 km offshore DAS array can offer ∼3 s improvement in the alert time of EEW compared to onshore seismic stations. Furthermore, we simulate and demonstrate that multiple DAS arrays extending toward the trench placed along the coast can uniformly improve alert times along a subduction zone by more than 5 s.

https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/nvidias-ai-bites-nails-as-us-halts-advanced-chipset-sales-to-china,Nvidia’s AI bites nails as US halts advanced chipset sales to China,"The US administration has gone forward with its objective of limiting China's access to advanced chipsets made in the country by introducing further regulations. A year back, the US announced new laws prohibiting companies operating out of its soil from selling specific chips used in supercomputing and AI to Chinese corporations. The limitations also targeted foreign enterprises that utilize US equipment. The Western superpower is engaged in an arms race with its Eastern counterpart, and such curbs are designed to limit the use of such cutting-edge semiconductors for military uses. According to information accessed initially by Reuters, chips intended for consumer items such as laptop computers would be excluded from the new tariffs. Corporations must notify the Commerce Department when processing orders for the most potent consumer chips to ensure they are not utilized in ways that endanger national security.The new updates to the rule were necessitated as many firms found a way to bypass the restrictions on exporting such chipsets. Nvidia, the world's most valuable chipmaker, was prevented from sending two of its most sophisticated AI chips to Chinese clients last year, processors that have become the industry standard for building chatbots and other AI systems. However, Nvidia quickly created other variations for the Chinese market that were less complex and circumvented US export limits. The H800 processor, for example, has the same computational capability as the company's more powerful but banned H100 device at particular settings used in AI work. Nvidia has now released a filing saying that the new export limitations will prevent the sale of two high-end AI processors explicitly designed for the Chinese market, the A800 and H800. It also stated that one of its gaming chips will be disabled. China accounts for up to 25% of its data center chip sales income. The US has maintained that such curbs are required to ensure that China does not use such advanced chipsets to manufacture weapons that may specifically target the country's cybersecurity initiatives. China has responded by alleging that the US restriction is intended to suppress its firms from advancing their businesses. ""The US needs to stop politicizing and weaponizing trade and tech issues and destabilizing global industrial and supply chains. We will closely follow the developments and firmly safeguard our rights and interests,"" Mao Ning, China's foreign ministry spokesperson, said. The relationship between the superpowers is hitting new lows after the trade war seen under the leadership of President Trump in 2018-19. In retaliation to the US curbs on chipsets last year, China restricted exports of two strategic materials in the semiconductor industry, gallium and germanium. Over the years, China has been moving some of its foreign-goods imports away from the United States. Both are concerned that the other side may suddenly weaponize trade flows, cutting off imports or exports in the name of security. According to statistics from 2022, US exports are lagging behind global counterparts selling into the Chinese market. Once significant, US-manufactured exports, such as automobiles and airplanes, have vanished. Unsurprisingly, the semiconductor sector sales also fell in 2022 and are unlikely to recover owing to a new US export control regime. US service exports plummeted during the epidemic and have yet to recover.According to the Semiconductor Industry Association, the new curbs go a step forward in national security and risk harming the industry. ""Overly broad, unilateral controls risk harming the US semiconductor ecosystem without advancing national security as they encourage overseas customers to look elsewhere. Accordingly, we urge the administration to strengthen coordination with allies to ensure a level playing field for all companies,"" said SIA.

https://interestingengineering.com/science/nasa-starts-planning-of-the-roman-telescopes-future-observations,NASA starts planning of the Roman telescope's future observations,"A new sophisticated telescope will soon join the next generation of advanced space observatories. NASA is making preparations for the launch of its next major astronomical observatory, the Nancy Roman Space Telescope, scheduled for 2027.The agency has already begun working with the space community to prepare plans for observations using the Roman telescope.In fact, NASA intends to begin cosmic investigations soon after the successful deployment of the telescope in the Lagrange point. “We’re harnessing the science community at large to lay a foundation, so when we get to launch we’ll be able to do powerful science right out of the gate. There’s a lot of exciting work to do, and many different ways for scientists to get involved,” said Julie McEnery, Roman’s senior project scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, in a NASA blog post. This cutting-edge telescope, originally known as the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST), will be critical in advancing our understanding of the cosmos, from the nature of dark energy to the discovery of exoplanets and other astrophysical research.The newly selected infrastructure teams will play a critical role in the initial phase by engaging in activities such as producing simulations, fine-tuning the telescope's components, and more. This will enable scientists to harness the telescope's capabilities as soon as it is launched.In essence, this initiative will equip scientists with the necessary tools to study countless cosmic entities and contribute to solving various enigmas, such as the nature of dark energy.Among the preparatory efforts, telescope simulations are of crucial importance. These simulations will enable the space community to evaluate algorithms, predict the scientific output of the Roman telescope, and refine the strategies employed for observations.“The preparatory work is complex, partly because everything Roman will do is quite interconnected. Each observation is going to be used by multiple teams for very different science cases, so we’re creating an environment that makes it as easy as possible for scientists to collaborate,” said McEnery. Interestingly, one team is developing software for processing and interpreting data from the Roman telescope's Coronagraph Instrument. This instrument will showcase its prowess in directly obtaining images of exoplanets. This development has the potential to be a game-changer for a field that is still relatively young. Furthermore, scientists will simulate numerous stellar processes and occurrences as well. Machine learning algorithms will assess models’ ability to detect these phenomena automatically.Developing quick and practical approaches for discovering underlying patterns is critical for this mission. The telescope is anticipated to accumulate 20,000 terabytes (20 petabytes) of observations, encompassing trillions of individual measurements of stars and galaxies throughout its five-year primary mission.The Nancy Roman Space Telescope will serve the valuable role of identifying intriguing celestial targets. These discoveries will provide observatories like NASA's James Webb Space Telescope with specific areas to focus on for more comprehensive and detailed scientific investigations.These efforts will immensely benefit teams and individuals worldwide who will collaborate to optimize the scientific capabilities of the Roman telescope.

https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/superlensing-microscope-without-superlens,Scientists invent superlensing microscope without a superlens,"Physicists at the University of Sydney Nano Institute in Australia have invented a superlensing microscope that does not actually use a superlens, a press release said. The invention is expected to help advance imaging in areas such as medical diagnostics, archaeology, and forensics. In the 17th century, Dutch microbiologist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek opened up a whole new world of smaller objects and microorganisms with his invention of the microscope. Over the years, scientists have been working to increase the power of these microscopes to peer deeper into this world and understand how it works. However, scientists soon came across the physical limitations of light waves. Objects smaller than half of the wavelength of light could not be observed using the optical approach. This is known as the diffraction limit. To advance, science now needed a superlens that could overcome this hurdle. A superlens is a lens made from metamaterials that can work beyond the diffraction limit. Different materials have been used in the past to make superlenses, and they work by producing a negative refractive index to produce nanometer-sized images. Superlenses typically work in close proximity to the object being examined. This is because the lenses work to capture high-resolution information that decays as it travels further. The low-resolution data does not decay quickly but the close proximity of the superlens distorts the image. In worst-case scenarios, superlenses absorb too much light and render their usage meaningless. A research team led by Alessandro Tuniz at the University of Sydney Nano Institute has found an alternate way to capture images of objects smaller than the diffraction limit by avoiding the superlens altogether. Uni Sydney Tuniz's team approached the issue at hand by placing the light source far away from the object. This way, they could capture both high and low-resolution information coming from it. Previous studies have also shown that keeping the probe further away ensures that it does not interfere with high-resolution data. By moving the probe away, the team was successful in maintaining the integrity of the high-resolution data and filtered out the low-resolution data using a post-processing step on the computer to get a clear final image. ""This produces a ‘truthful’ image of the object through the selective amplification of evanescent, or vanishing light waves,"" said Tuniz in the press release. ""This technique is a first step in allowing high-resolution images while staying at a safe distance from the object without distorting what you see.""The researchers used light at terahertz frequency at millimeter wavelength, in the region between visible and microwave, which is useful for biological imaging such as visualizing protein structures or cancerous cells. However, that's not all. ""Our method could be applied to determine moisture content in leaves with greater resolution, or be useful in advanced microfabrication techniques, such as non-destructive assessment of microchip integrity,"" added Boris Kuhlmey, associated professor at Sydney Nano, who was involved in the work. (It) could even be used to reveal hidden layers in artwork, perhaps proving useful in uncovering art forgery or hidden works.""The research findings were published in the journal Nature Communications.
