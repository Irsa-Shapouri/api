https://www.reuters.com/world/us/floridas-desantis-signs-law-restricting-social-media-people-under-16-2024-03-25/,Florida's DeSantis signs law restricting social media for people under 16,"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis recently signed a bill that imposes new restrictions on children's access to social media platforms. The law bans children under the age of 14 from using social media altogether and requires parental consent for 14- and 15-year-olds. Supporters argue that these measures will protect children's mental health from the dangers of online platforms.

Under the new legislation, social media platforms are required to terminate the accounts of users under 14 years old and those under 16 who lack parental consent. To enforce these age restrictions, platforms must implement a third-party verification system to identify underage users.

It is worth noting that the Republican-led Florida legislature initially passed a bill in February that would have prohibited children under 16 from using social media entirely. However, Governor DeSantis vetoed this bill, stating that it infringed upon parents' rights. The revised version of the bill now allows parents to grant consent for older children to access social media. The law will go into effect on January 1, 2025.

Governor DeSantis emphasized the harmful impact of social media on children, stating that ""social media harms children in a variety of ways."" He believes that this legislation gives parents more control over their children's online activities and helps protect them from potential harm.

Proponents of the bill argue that excessive use of social media can have detrimental effects on children's well-being, leading to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. They believe that these restrictions will help mitigate these negative consequences.

However, critics contend that the law violates the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which protects freedom of speech. They argue that decisions regarding their children's online presence should be made by parents, not the government, regardless of their age.

Meta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, has opposed the legislation. They argue that it limits parental discretion and raises concerns about data privacy due to the personal information that users would have to provide for age verification. Meta supports federal legislation that requires parental approval for downloads by children from online app stores.

While the bill does not explicitly mention any specific social media platforms, it targets sites that employ features such as ""infinite scrolling,"" display reaction metrics like likes, feature auto-play videos, and offer live-streaming and push notifications. Websites and apps primarily used for email, messaging, or texting between specific senders and recipients would be exempt from the law.

The new legislation also mandates that social media companies permanently delete personal information collected from terminated accounts. Additionally, it allows parents to file civil lawsuits against platforms that fail to comply with these requirements.

Florida is not the first state to regulate children's access to social media. Utah became the first state to implement such laws in March 2023, followed by states like Arkansas, Louisiana, Ohio, and Texas. Numerous other states are considering similar regulations, as indicated by a legislative analysis prepared for the Florida bill.

In conclusion, Florida's new law aims to protect children from the potential risks associated with social media by imposing age restrictions and requiring parental consent. While supporters argue that these measures safeguard children's mental health, critics raise concerns about potential violations of free speech and parental rights. The law will take effect on January 1, 2025, and its impact will be closely monitored by other states contemplating similar regulations.",https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MIALARPPIBJ3PCVXMFVQKH2QUY.jpg?auth=759c0ddcbb82653dbdf6d25fe7d2670fa08b08e5fae89da0c6f5ecd397ad07e9&width=1920&height=1005&smart=true,2024-03-25 17:07:20,Innovation,Innovation

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-liquid-iron-battery-grid-energy.html,New all-liquid iron flow battery for grid energy storage,"Flow batteries, a type of battery that stores energy in two chambers filled with different liquids, have been used for large-scale energy storage since the 1980s. However, researchers at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have developed a new design that utilizes a commonplace chemical used in water treatment facilities. This design offers a safe, economical, and water-based solution for energy storage, which is crucial for incorporating intermittent energy sources like wind and solar power into the electric grid.

The researchers, led by battery researcher Gabriel Nambafu, utilized an iron-based battery that demonstrated remarkable cycling stability over one thousand consecutive charging cycles while maintaining 98.7% of its maximum capacity. This is a significant improvement compared to previous studies on iron-based batteries, which reported a much higher degradation of charge capacity over fewer cycles.

What sets this battery apart is the unique liquid chemical formula used to store energy. It combines charged iron with a neutral-pH phosphate-based liquid electrolyte called nitrogenous triphosphonate, nitrilotri-methylphosphonic acid or NTMPA. This chemical is commercially available in industrial quantities because it is commonly used to prevent corrosion in water treatment plants.

Phosphonates, including NTMPA, belong to a broad chemical family based on phosphorus. They are known for their ability to dissolve well in water and their non-toxic properties, making them suitable for various applications such as fertilizers and detergents.

The development of new flow battery technologies is crucial for modernizing the U.S. electric grid and enabling the storage of energy from renewable sources like wind and solar power. Flow batteries consist of two chambers filled with different liquids, and they charge through an electrochemical reaction, storing energy in chemical bonds. When connected to an external circuit, they release that energy to power electrical devices. Unlike conventional batteries, flow batteries feature two external supply tanks of liquid that constantly circulate through them, serving as the battery system's ""blood supply."" The larger the electrolyte supply tank, the more energy the flow battery can store.

Flow batteries have the advantage of being scalable, meaning they can be built at any scale, from lab-bench size to the size of a city block. They can serve as backup generators for the electric grid and are an essential component of decarbonization strategies that aim to store energy from renewable sources. In the near term, grid operators plan to locate battery energy storage systems (BESS) in urban or suburban areas near energy consumers. The aqueous flow battery design developed by the researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory could help address safety concerns in these areas. It operates in water at neutral pH, which is advantageous for consumer safety.

The initial design developed by the research team has an energy density of up to 9 watt-hours per liter (Wh/L). While this is lower than commercialized vanadium-based systems, which have an energy density of 25 Wh/L, the use of Earth-abundant materials in the design allows for scalability to provide the same energy output. Higher energy density batteries can store more energy in a smaller space, but the use of Earth-abundant materials is a more sustainable and cost-effective solution.

The research conducted by the team at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory offers a promising pathway for large-scale energy storage using flow batteries. By repurposing a commonplace chemical, they have developed a safe, economical, and water-based solution that can help incorporate renewable energy sources into the electric grid. With further development and optimization, flow batteries could play a significant role in modernizing the U.S. electric grid and ensuring a more sustainable and reliable energy future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/new-all-liquid-iron-fl.jpg,2024-03-25 07:22:25,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.zdnet.com/article/saving-hours-of-work-with-ai-how-chatgpt-became-my-virtual-assistant-for-a-data-project/,Saving hours of work with AI: How ChatGPT became my virtual assistant for a data project,"Generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT have been receiving a lot of attention lately. While they have been hailed as revolutionary, it's important to remember that they are simply tools that can assist with various projects. Today, I want to share with you a project where ChatGPT proved to be a valuable asset, saving me hours of tedious work. Although your own projects may not require the same approach, my experience may inspire you to explore the potential of ChatGPT as a workhorse tool.

The project I undertook involved creating what I like to call a ""stunt article."" These are fun projects that I come up with and know will capture the interest of readers. In this particular article, I decided to showcase how much computer gear I could buy from Temu for under $100. After some careful selection, I managed to come in at a total of $99.77.

Putting together this article involved scouring the Temu website for items to feature. For instance, I found an iPad keyboard and mouse that cost around $6. To stay within my budget, I needed to add all the Temu links to a spreadsheet, find the price of each item, and rearrange things until I reached my desired total.

The challenge I faced was converting the Temu links into a usable format. That's where ChatGPT came to the rescue.

Phase 1: Gathering the links
To start, I collected all the links and pasted them into a Notion page. Notion offers the option to create bookmark blocks that not only include links but also product names. Once I had selected all the blocks, I copied and pasted them into a text editor. Although the resulting page may appear messy, it proved to be a useful resource.

Phase 2: Identifying the data
Each data block had three crucial elements. First, the product name was enclosed in braces and displayed in gold text. Second, the base URL of the product, surrounded by parentheses, was shown in green text. Lastly, there was a question mark separating the main page URL from additional tracking data. I only needed the main URL. The delimiters were highlighted in purple.

Phase 3: Teaching ChatGPT to recognize the data
I fed ChatGPT the prompt: ""Accept the following data and await further instructions."" Then, I copied and pasted all the information from the text editor into ChatGPT. At this point, ChatGPT knew to wait for more details.

The next step was the crux of the project. I wanted ChatGPT to extract the titles and links while discarding the rest. I provided the prompt: ""The data above consists of a series of blocks of data..."" This prompt allowed me to name the data for future reference and test ChatGPT's understanding of the assignment.

ChatGPT successfully completed the assignment but paused when its buffer ran out. I prompted the bot to continue, and it provided the remaining data. Completing this task manually would have involved a lot of tedious cutting and pasting, but ChatGPT accomplished it in less than a minute.

Phase 4: Cleaning up Temu's titles
Temu's product titles were overly complex for my project. Instead of including the full title, I wanted to simplify them. For example, I transformed ""10 Inch LCD Writing Tablet, Electronis Memo With Leather Protective Case, Electronic Drawing Board For Digital Handwriting Pad Doodle Board, Gifts For"" into ""LCD writing tablet with case."" I assigned this task to ChatGPT as well, reminding it that it had already parsed and identified the data. I find that reminding ChatGPT about previous steps helps it incorporate the information more reliably.

By leveraging ChatGPT's capabilities, I was able to streamline the process and save valuable time. Whether you're working on a similar project or exploring the potential of AI tools, ChatGPT can be a powerful asset. Its ability to understand prompts, extract relevant information, and assist with complex tasks can significantly enhance productivity.

Remember, while generative AI tools are impressive, they are ultimately just tools. They can be immensely helpful, but it's important to approach them as aids rather than replacements for human creativity and expertise.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/70d8814af33b190ff84b8faa5f9bafe13d3586e2/2024/03/25/7d1cb1ff-3bb7-4972-a6cd-33d04da76bc1/cover.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-deep-geothermal-renewable-powerhouse.html,Dig deep: US bets on geothermal to become renewable powerhouse,"Geothermal energy, while currently representing a small percentage of US energy production, has caught the attention of businesses and the Biden administration as a potential backbone of the green transition. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm believes that if the heat beneath our feet can be harnessed, it can provide clean, reliable, and scalable power for industries and households alike. The Department of Energy estimates that geothermal energy could even surpass hydroelectric and solar power in the country by 2050.

Geothermal energy utilizes the naturally high temperatures underground to produce electricity and heat buildings. In 2022, it accounted for only 1.6 percent of US energy consumption. To increase production, the US government has invested over $200 million since 2018 in an experimental site in Utah. This site explores Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) technology, which involves injecting water into naturally hot rocks, often located over two miles deep. This approach eliminates the need for nearby hot springs or underground reservoirs.

Francesco d'Avack, an analyst with S&P Global Commodity Insights, explains that geothermal energy can theoretically be generated anywhere. Additionally, the upfront risk of drilling and finding nothing, which has discouraged some investors in the past, is significantly reduced with this technology. Furthermore, the US government is streamlining the permit conversion process from oil or gas exploration to geothermal licenses, reducing paperwork and delays. The use of EGS also requires fewer chemical additives compared to traditional fracking methods, which is more environmentally friendly.

Geothermal energy offers a consistent flow of energy regardless of weather or time of day, unlike solar or wind power. The US government predicts that the cost of geothermal energy will decrease from the current range of $70 to $100 per megawatt hour (MWh) to $45 by 2035. Leveraging existing drilling technology makes geothermal energy development both quicker and cheaper.

The US has been at the forefront of adopting this new technology, with other countries such as France also exploring EGS sites. However, there is a risk of inducing seismic activity, similar to what can occur with fracking. The US Energy Department has implemented a mitigation protocol for all funded projects to address this issue and is funding research in this area. While seismicity has not been felt near any DOE-funded project, it is crucial to continue monitoring and addressing potential risks.

There is growing interest in the geothermal energy market, with several US and Canadian start-ups raising significant investments. Fervo Energy, for example, has successfully connected its Nevada site to the electric grid with support from Google. Big corporations like Google, Microsoft, and Nucor are also starting to purchase geothermal energy. This increased demand signals a positive outlook for the industry.

Cindy Taff, CEO of Sage Geosystems, believes that the geothermal energy market is still open for new and next-generation players. The first successful commercial facility will pave the way for others to follow suit. As the industry is still relatively small, responsible and sustainable growth is the primary objective.

In conclusion, geothermal energy holds immense potential as a clean and reliable source of power. While it currently represents a small fraction of US energy production, advancements in technology and government support are driving its growth. By leveraging Enhanced Geothermal Systems, reducing risks, and addressing environmental concerns, geothermal energy can play a significant role in the green transition. With increasing interest from major corporations and investments in infrastructure, the future of geothermal energy looks promising.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/a-worker-operates-a-dr.jpg,2024-03-25 04:59:03,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/swift-planning-launch-new-central-bank-digital-currency-platform-12-24-months-2024-03-25/,SWIFT planning launch of new central bank digital currency platform in 12-24 months,"SWIFT, the global bank messaging network, has announced plans to create a new platform in the next one to two years. This platform will connect the emerging central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to the existing financial system. With around 90% of the world's central banks exploring digital currencies, this move by SWIFT is expected to have a significant impact on the CBDC ecosystem.

The decision to launch the platform will likely coincide with the launch of the first major CBDCs. SWIFT's head of innovation, Nick Kerigan, stated that the recent trial, which lasted six months and involved a group of central banks, commercial banks, and settlement platforms, was one of the largest collaborations on CBDCs and tokenized assets. The trial focused on ensuring interoperability between different countries' CBDCs, even if they were built on different underlying technologies. This would reduce payment system fragmentation risks.

The trial also demonstrated that CBDCs could be used for complex trade or foreign exchange payments and potentially automated to speed up and reduce costs. The results of the trial were widely regarded as a success, providing SWIFT with a timeline to work towards. Kerigan stated that they are looking at launching the platform as a product within the next 12-24 months.

However, the timeline could still change if major economy CBDC launches are delayed. SWIFT aims to be ready for the launch of CBDCs to maintain its dominant position in the bank-to-bank network. Several countries, including the Bahamas, Nigeria, Jamaica, and China, already have operational CBDCs. The European Central Bank and the Bank for International Settlements are also running trials for digital currencies.

SWIFT's advantage lies in its existing network, which is already operational in over 200 countries and connects more than 11,500 banks and funds. This network handles trillions of dollars in transactions daily. The scalability of SWIFT's network would provide banks with a single global connection point for digital asset payments, rather than setting up individual connections with every counterparty.

Kerigan also mentioned a forecast by Boston Consulting Group that by 2030, around $16 trillion worth of assets could be tokenized. Tokenization involves transforming assets like stocks and bonds into digital tokens that can be issued and traded in real-time. SWIFT believes that by integrating various networks into its system, it can provide a more scalable option for the industry.

In summary, SWIFT is planning to create a platform to connect central bank digital currencies to the existing financial system. This move is expected to have a significant impact on the CBDC ecosystem. The recent trial conducted by SWIFT was successful in demonstrating the interoperability and potential benefits of CBDCs. SWIFT aims to launch the platform within the next one to two years, aligning with the launch of major CBDCs. With its existing network and scalability, SWIFT is well-positioned to maintain its dominant role in the bank-to-bank network.",https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UUDGY355ONLBXGONVFMQTN5QUY.jpg?auth=939bafd8676ab83c7a68c4a343248be9cc30e197d22f24e54a6cda618c66d336&width=1920&height=1005&smart=true,2024-03-25 18:44:59,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-large-language-simple-mechanism-knowledge.html,Large language models use a surprisingly simple mechanism to retrieve some stored knowledge,"Large language models (LLMs) are complex tools used in various applications, but their inner workings are not fully understood. Researchers at MIT and other institutions have studied how these models retrieve information to gain a better understanding. Surprisingly, they discovered that LLMs often use simple linear functions to decode stored facts, and they use the same function for similar types of facts. Linear functions, which involve two variables and no exponents, represent a straightforward relationship between variables.

By identifying these linear functions for different facts, researchers can probe the model to determine its knowledge about new subjects and where that knowledge is stored. They developed a technique to estimate these functions and found that even when a model provides incorrect answers, it often has stored the correct information. This approach could be used in the future to identify and correct falsehoods within the model, reducing the likelihood of incorrect or nonsensical responses.

Neural networks, such as transformer models, form the basis of large language models. These networks consist of interconnected nodes or neurons organized into layers to process and encode data. The knowledge stored in a transformer can be represented as relations connecting subjects and objects. For example, the relation ""Miles Davis plays the trumpet"" connects the subject (Miles Davis) to the object (trumpet).

As a transformer acquires more knowledge, it stores additional facts about a subject across multiple layers. When a user poses a query about that subject, the model must decode the most relevant fact to provide a response. The researchers aimed to understand the mechanism responsible for this decoding process.

Through a series of experiments, they discovered that despite their complexity, LLMs use simple linear functions to decode relational information. Each function is specific to the type of fact being retrieved. For example, the model uses one decoding function to output the instrument a person plays and a different function to output the state where a person was born.

The researchers developed a method to estimate these functions and computed functions for 47 different relations. They focused on a specific subset of relations, such as ""capital city of a country"" and ""lead singer of a band,"" to represent the types of facts that can be expressed using linear functions.

To test the functions, they changed the subject and observed if the correct object information could be recovered. The results showed that the model successfully retrieved the correct information using the estimated linear functions for these relations.

Understanding these linear functions and how they decode stored facts in LLMs provides valuable insights into the inner workings of these models. It reveals that despite their complexity, there are simple mechanisms at play. By further exploring and utilizing these mechanisms, researchers can improve the accuracy and reliability of large language models.

In conclusion, large language models employ linear functions to recover and decode stored facts. This discovery sheds light on the inner workings of these complex models and provides opportunities for improving their performance. By identifying and utilizing these mechanisms, researchers can enhance the accuracy and reliability of large language models in various applications.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/large-language-models-2.jpg,2024-03-25 09:34:06,Innovation,Innovation

Kuruvilla confirmed the leadership change on LinkedIn and X by posting a simple message, ""One-Click Checkedout from @bolt! Onwards,"" along with a rocket emoji. However, he declined to provide further comments on the matter. Arjun Sethi, a co-founder of venture firm Tribe Capital, commented on Kuruvilla's post, expressing his admiration for the executive.

According to a report from The Information, the Bolt board voted to remove Kuruvilla over the weekend. Kuruvilla, a former executive at Amazon, took on the role of CEO in January 2022 after founder Ryan Breslow stepped down.

In contrast to Kuruvilla's limited statement, Grooms' LinkedIn profile provides more information about his background. He joined Bolt five years ago and has previously held executive positions at companies such as Ultraleap (formerly Leap Motion), Datron World Communications, and Qualcomm.

When asked about the change in leadership, Bolt stated that the CEO role had changed and characterized Kuruvilla's departure as ""amicable."" However, no further details were provided.

Bolt has faced its fair share of controversies in the past. The company was founded by Breslow, who dropped out of Stanford at the age of 27. Breslow was known for his outspoken rants. In an interview with TechCrunch, he mentioned that Bolt had signed significant deals in the second half of 2021, surpassing any previous deals in the company's history.

However, the company encountered difficulties along the way. Bolt was the subject of a federal probe regarding potential violations of securities laws during its fundraising efforts in 2021. The company was seeking a $355 million Series E round, which valued the company at $11 billion. Bolt managed to raise approximately $1 billion in total venture-backed funding.

Additionally, Bolt experienced multiple rounds of layoffs, with the first occurring in May 2022. At least 185 employees, or one-third of the workforce, were let go. Subsequent layoffs took place in early 2023 and December 2023, affecting 29% of the staff.

In October, Kuruvilla stated in an interview with TechCrunch that the SEC was no longer investigating Bolt. He also mentioned that the company was working towards profitability and had plans to introduce new features, such as improving merchandise returns and providing personalized experiences for its universal shopper network. Bolt announced partnerships with various retailers, including Saks OFF 5TH, Shinola, Filson, Lafayette 148, and Toys ""R"" Us, in November.

More recently, Bolt entered into a deal with Checkout.com, becoming the exclusive one-click checkout provider for Checkout.com. In return, Checkout.com became Bolt's preferred payment partner.

However, Bolt remains committed to its mission and has formed partnerships with prominent retailers and payment providers.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Headshot_Maju-Kuruvilla_CEO-of-Bolt-1.jpg?resize=1200,813",2024-03-25 21:15:07,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/elon-musk-x-ccdh-california-lawsuit-dismissed/,A judge just killed Elon Musk's lawsuit against an anti-hate research org,"A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by Elon Musk and X against the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), a nonprofit that conducts research on online hate. The lawsuit was brought against CCDH after it published reports about hate and extremism on the platform, which X claimed resulted in significant financial losses. Musk and X also accused CCDH of scraping data illegally and violating the platform's rules by using a third-party social media monitoring tool called Brandwatch.

The CCDH filed a motion to dismiss X's claims under California's law against Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (SLAPP), which aims to prevent frivolous lawsuits intended to intimidate. The organization accused Musk of purposely prolonging the legal process to increase their legal costs. United States district judge Charles R. Breyer granted CCDH's motion to dismiss and denied Musk and X the opportunity to relitigate the case.

Judge Breyer stated in the ruling that it was clear that X Corp. brought the case to punish CCDH for criticizing their publications and to discourage others from engaging in such critiques. He emphasized the importance of free speech and the right to research and advocate.

The CCDH has been actively tracking hate speech on various platforms, including Twitter. They highlighted the rise of hate speech on the platform after Musk's takeover, particularly his decision to unban several highly followed extremists. The nonprofit's research shed light on disturbing content across social media platforms, addressing issues such as eating disorder content on TikTok, climate denial on YouTube, and violent misogynistic threats on Instagram.

CCDH CEO Imran Ahmed expressed satisfaction with the court's ruling, stating that it affirmed their right to research, speak, and hold social media companies accountable for their decisions. The organization aims to combat lies and hate and protect fundamental human rights and civil liberties.

The nonprofit's legal team, led by Roberta Kaplan, celebrated the victory, emphasizing that the ruling demonstrated that even the wealthiest individuals cannot manipulate the rule of law. Kaplan recently achieved a significant win in the E. Jean Carroll defamation suit against former President Donald Trump.

Although the CCDH celebrated its victory in California, Musk is pursuing a similar lawsuit against the left-leaning media watchdog Media Matters for America. However, the lawsuit against Media Matters for America is taking place in Texas, which lacks the same protections against frivolous lawsuits as California.

This ruling provides relief to researchers who work diligently to track and combat online extremism. It upholds the importance of free speech and the right to hold social media platforms accountable for their actions. While the fight against online hate continues, this victory sets a precedent for organizations like CCDH to continue their vital work.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/twitter-x-logo-musk-pattern.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-25 20:33:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewwight/2024/03/25/how-are-scientists-saving-colombias-delicious-native-palm-species/,How Are Scientists Saving Colombia’s Delicious Native Palm Species,"Colombia is known for its rich biodiversity, including a wide variety of palm species. However, over 200 Colombian palm species are at risk of extinction, which has prompted scientists to take action in preserving these important plants. Two key food species, the Taparo palm and the Chontaduro or peach palm, are of particular cultural and economic significance in the central and southern regions of the country.

Alberto Gomez Mejia, a botanist and founder of the Quindio Botanical Garden, is leading efforts to protect the genetic diversity of these palm species. His team aims to establish a gene bank, reintroduce the palms into the wild, and develop sustainable commercial plantations. With the largest collection of palms in Colombia, Gomez and his team have the resources to make a significant impact on the preservation of these endangered species.

To achieve their goals, Gomez and his team will collaborate with local communities to conserve wild populations, gather population data on the palms, and study their reproductive patterns in the central Andes of Colombia. Their efforts have been recognized and supported by organizations such as the Whitley Fund for Nature, which awarded Gomez a Whitley Award in 2005 and provided funding for the development of palm gene banks.

Gomez's journey into conservation was unconventional. He initially studied law and taught philosophy before becoming interested in ecology in 1972. This newfound passion led him to become a university professor and eventually the mayor of Armenia, earning him the nickname ""Ecologist Mayor."" Throughout his career, Gomez has attended numerous conservation events and emphasizes the importance of harnessing the biological diversity of the Global South.

In addition to the preservation of palm species, other researchers in Colombia are also making important discoveries. One such researcher has recently identified a new plant species called Glossolomamagenticristatum. This species faces threats from periodic roadside maintenance and the overall decline of Andean forests due to colonization and agriculture. Understanding the biodiversity of Colombia and the risks faced by these species is crucial for developing effective conservation and management strategies.

Laura Clavijo, an assistant professor at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia and co-author of the study on Glossolomamagenticristatum, emphasizes the importance of collaboration with local communities to protect native species. Through research and community involvement, scientists can gain a better understanding of Colombia's unique flora and work towards preserving its natural heritage.

Colombia's plants hold great potential for food, medicine, handicrafts, and ornamentation. However, this potential remains largely untapped, and more than half of Colombian families live in food insecurity. Gomez believes that education is key to unlocking the nutritional power of these plants and inspiring a love for their preservation. By raising awareness and promoting knowledge, Colombia can better appreciate its biological riches and ensure the survival of its native species.

Preserving the palm species and other unique plants in Colombia is not only crucial for the country's biodiversity but also for the global ecosystem. Each species plays a role in maintaining the balance of nature and contributes to the overall health of our planet. Through the efforts of dedicated scientists like Alberto Gomez Mejia and Laura Clavijo, we can hope for a future where these incredible plants continue to thrive and enrich our world.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660196dcec2b8dcfcc90103a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 18:24:36,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-targets-russian-fintech-operators-ukraine-sanctions-evasion-work-2024-03-25/,US targets Russian fintech operators for Ukraine sanctions evasion work,"The U.S. Treasury has recently announced the imposition of sanctions on several Russian financial services and technology players, including blockchain firm Atomyze. These sanctions were put in place due to their involvement in developing or offering services in virtual assets that aimed to evade the Ukraine war-related sanctions on Russia.

The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the Treasury has designated 13 entities and two individuals as part of this round of sanctions. The main objective is to target Russia's core financial infrastructure and prevent its use of the international financial system to further its Ukraine war aims.

Among the entities targeted is Atomyze, a fintech firm controlled by Russian billionaire Vladimir Potanin's Interros Holding investment group. Atomyze has been designated for its work in tokenizing precious metals and diamonds for Russian companies, as well as its partnership with sanctioned Russian banks Rosbank and Sovcombank.

Another company on the list is Lighthouse, a fintech firm that executed the first cash-backed Russian digital asset deal in June 2022. Lighthouse has collaborated with Russia's sanctioned central bank and major lenders VTB and Sberbank.

Additional financial technology firms that have been hit with OFAC sanctions include B-Crypto, Masterchain, and Veb3 Technology. These sanctions generally prohibit the designated entities from engaging in U.S. dollar transactions and using the U.S. financial system.

It is important to note that these sanctions are specifically targeted at entities and individuals involved in activities that circumvent the existing sanctions on Russia. The U.S. Treasury aims to disrupt Russia's financial networks and prevent them from evading sanctions through the use of virtual assets and technology.

By imposing these sanctions, the U.S. government is taking a strong stance against those who seek to undermine international efforts to address the conflict in Ukraine. It is a clear message that attempts to bypass sanctions will not be tolerated and will be met with severe consequences.

This latest round of sanctions highlights the U.S. government's commitment to maintaining the integrity of the international financial system and enforcing sanctions aimed at promoting peace and stability. The Treasury's actions demonstrate a proactive approach in addressing emerging challenges related to virtual assets and financial technology.

In conclusion, the U.S. Treasury's imposition of sanctions on Russian financial services and technology players is a significant step in preventing the evasion of Ukraine war-related sanctions. By targeting key entities involved in the development and offering of services in virtual assets, the Treasury aims to disrupt Russia's financial networks and prevent the misuse of the international financial system. These sanctions send a clear message that attempts to bypass sanctions will not be tolerated, and further actions may be taken to address emerging challenges in the field of financial technology.",https://www.reuters.com/pf/resources/images/reuters/reuters-default.webp?d=183,2024-03-25 15:40:25,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/bankrupt-ev-startup-arrival-sold-its-assets-to-canoo/,Bankrupt EV startup Arrival sold its assets to Canoo,"Bankrupt electric vehicle (EV) startup Arrival has sold some of its assets, including advanced manufacturing equipment, to struggling startup Canoo, which is also trying to build and sell EVs. Canoo, facing challenges in moving beyond prototypes to commercial production, stated that the acquisition of these assets would reduce its capital expenditures by 20%. The purchased assets, which are currently packed into more than 20 container ships, will be sent to Canoo's facility in Oklahoma. Canoo had previously acquired all the new and ""like-new"" assets owned by Arrival's business unit in the United States. However, it is unclear whether Canoo acquired any of Arrival's intellectual property (IP).

Arrival announced its plans to sell off assets and IP from its UK division in January after filing for bankruptcy protection in the UK. The company, once valued at over $13 billion and backed by Hyundai and UPS, aimed to revolutionize EV production by building compact ""microfactories"" in city centers. However, these plans, including the production of an electric bus, vans, and a purpose-built car for Uber, fell apart due to financial difficulties and a series of executive departures. Arrival underwent multiple restructuring efforts, resulting in layoffs, and shifted its focus from the UK to the US to conserve capital. Unfortunately, Arrival never successfully produced commercial vehicles at scale, and its current market valuation is around $7.7 million. The company eventually filed for bankruptcy.

Canoo, on the other hand, has faced its own set of challenges. After going public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, the company struggled to produce its unique EV design based on a ""skateboard"" architecture. This design houses the batteries and electric drivetrain in a chassis beneath the vehicle's cabin, creating an eye-catching design. Canoo reported having over $1 billion in its sales pipeline, largely due to a deal with Walmart to purchase 4,500 units, with an option to buy up to 10,000 units. However, the company has faced difficulties in converting these sales into actual deliveries.

Canoo is currently a pre-revenue company that is burning through cash. To stay afloat, it has resorted to stock splits and issuing more shares. Last year, the company moved to a different tier in the Nasdaq Exchange after its stock price fell below $1, triggering a delisting notice.

Although both Arrival and Canoo have faced numerous challenges and setbacks, Canoo's acquisition of Arrival's assets presents an opportunity for the struggling startup to reduce its capital expenditures and potentially accelerate its progress towards commercial production. The EV industry remains highly competitive, and these two companies will need to overcome their respective obstacles to achieve success in the market.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/canoo-walmart-arkansas.jpg?resize=1200,670",2024-03-25 22:15:20,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-pairing-crypto-green-hydrogen-energy.html,"Pairing crypto mining with green hydrogen offers clean energy boost, study suggests","Cryptocurrency mining, known for its high energy consumption, can be paired with green hydrogen to promote the use of renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, according to a recent study conducted by Cornell University. The study, titled ""Climate Sustainability Through a Dynamic Duo: Green Hydrogen and Crypto Driving Energy Transition and Decarbonization,"" emphasizes the need to explore opportunities for utilizing the growing interest in cryptocurrency to achieve a sustainable and climate-friendly future.

Fengqi You, a professor of energy systems engineering at Cornell, highlights the importance of developing a green hydrogen infrastructure to support cryptocurrency production. This combination, referred to as the ""dynamic duo"" by the researchers, has the potential to accelerate the growth of renewable energy sectors. By using clean energy sources for blockchain mining and green hydrogen production, the capacity for wind and solar energy can be expanded, leading to a more sustainable energy landscape.

The current structure of cryptocurrency mining in the U.S. consumes a significant amount of carbon-based energy, equivalent to the energy consumption of an entire country like Argentina, as stated in a 2022 report from the White House Office of Science and Technology. The majority of crypto-mining operations rely on energy-intensive consensus mechanisms, known as ""proof of work,"" to validate crypto-assets. Preliminary estimates from the U.S. Energy Information Administration suggest that cryptocurrency mining may account for 0.6% to 2.3% of total U.S. electricity consumption in 2023.

In response to the substantial energy demands of cryptocurrency mining, the researchers propose a technology solution that leverages cryptocurrencies as virtual energy carriers alongside green hydrogen. This innovative approach transforms the environmental challenge of crypto-mining into a powerful force for climate mitigation and sustainability.

The study conducted by You and his team focused on assessing the energy potentials of individual U.S. states. They discovered that supporting cryptocurrency could accelerate the development of additional energy infrastructure. For example, mining one Bitcoin in New Mexico could potentially generate 78.4 megawatt hours of solar power, while mining one Bitcoin in Wyoming could potentially produce 265.8 megawatt hours of wind power. This demonstrates the potential for cryptocurrency to contribute to the growth of renewable energy sources.

Although cryptocurrency holds a high dollar value, it is important to understand that it is a virtual asset. Similarly, cryptocurrency can also hold an energy value, comparable to the concept of a gift card. By recognizing this energy value and combining it with green hydrogen, cryptocurrency can not only mitigate its own environmental impact but also pave the way for a sustainable renewable energy transition.

To achieve a sustainable future for blockchain-based cryptocurrency, the researchers emphasize the need for stronger federal policies that support climate goals and renewable energy. By coupling cryptocurrency with green hydrogen, this approach not only addresses its environmental impact but also pioneers a sustainable pathway for the transition to renewable energy.

Fengqi You is a senior faculty fellow at the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability. His research, in collaboration with Apoorv Lal, sheds light on the potential of pairing cryptocurrency mining with green hydrogen as a means to promote renewable energy and combat climate change.

In conclusion, the study from Cornell University highlights the potential of combining cryptocurrency mining with green hydrogen to drive the adoption of renewable energy sources. By utilizing clean energy for crypto-mining operations and green hydrogen production, the capacity for wind and solar energy can be expanded, leading to a more sustainable energy landscape. This innovative approach not only addresses the environmental impact of cryptocurrency but also paves the way for a sustainable future. Stronger federal policies supporting climate goals and renewable energy are necessary to fully realize the potential of this dynamic duo.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2023/cryptocurrencies.jpg,2024-03-25 15:00:02,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/match-board-directors-after-talks-activist-investor-elliott-management/,Match appoints two board directors after talks with activist investor Elliott Management,"Tinder-owner Match Group has made some significant changes to its board of directors and formed a partnership with Elliott Management, an activist investor, according to an announcement made on Monday. Laura Jones, the chief marketing officer at Instacart, and Spencer Rascoff, the co-founder of Zillow, will be joining the board with immediate effect.

Match stated in a press release that these appointments were the result of a ""constructive dialogue"" with Elliott Management. The two companies have entered into an ""information-sharing"" agreement. This news comes a few months after The Wall Street Journal reported that Elliott had acquired a stake of around $1 billion in Match Group. The report suggested that Elliott was interested in discussing strategies to improve Match's performance, as the company has been facing a decline in paying users due to economic uncertainties.

Marc Steinberg, a partner at Elliott, expressed confidence in Match Group's potential for value creation as the global leader in online dating. He mentioned that the collaboration with management and the board has been productive, and he believes that Laura Jones and Spencer Rascoff's unique skills and perspectives will contribute to the company's growth in its next phase.

Elliott Management has a track record of acquiring stakes in technology companies and driving changes. Their push for change at Match follows similar board shakeups at Crown Castle and Etsy.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, Match Group experienced a 5% decline in the number of total paid users compared to the previous year, resulting in a total of 15.2 million users. The company's growth has slowed down from the peak it reached during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to a 79% decline in its stock value since its highest point in 2021.

Match Group is the parent company of several popular dating apps, including Tinder, Hinge, Match.com, Meetic, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, OurTime, and more.

Overall, Match Group's recent board appointments and partnership with Elliott Management indicate a strategic effort to address the company's challenges and drive growth in the online dating industry. With the addition of Laura Jones and Spencer Rascoff, Match Group aims to leverage their expertise and insights to navigate the next phase of its development.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1241790742.jpeg?w=1024,2024-03-25 14:15:04,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/gostudent-tutoring-profitability/,"GoStudent, the online learning platform, says it's now profitable","GoStudent, the Vienna-based online tutoring marketplace, has established itself as one of the leading startups in Austria. With 11 million families and 23,000 tutors on its platform, GoStudent has now achieved profitability. CEO Felix Ohswald stated that the company is not just EBITDA profitable, but also has positive operating cash flow. Alongside Bitpanda and Runtastic, GoStudent is one of the few Austrian startups to gain international recognition.

However, reaching profitability was not without its challenges. The online learning market experienced a crash, resulting in a decline in customer demand and significant losses for GoStudent. In 2021, the company lost €89 million, which increased to €220 million in 2022. This led to layoffs and cost-cutting measures.

GoStudent experienced rapid growth from 2019 to 2022, scaling its core business to over €100 million in revenue within two years. But this growth came at a cost, with a cash burn of over €150 million in 2022 alone. As the market changed, the company realized it needed to reduce its burn rate. It cut costs by 70% in 2023 but still faced challenges. The company underwent multiple rounds of layoffs to ensure sustainable growth.

The COVID-19 pandemic played a significant role in the success of GoStudent. The digital transformation accelerated the adoption of edtech solutions, and GoStudent became a go-to platform for online tutoring. To overcome its cash burn issues, the company made several strategic changes. It stopped hosting lavish parties, halted acquisitions, and refrained from expanding to new markets where online tutoring was not established. It also exited the U.S. market and refocused on Europe, adopting a more organic growth strategy.

GoStudent's goal is to become the leading global school and provide personalized tutoring to unlock every student's potential. While the company primarily offers tutoring services, its acquisition of Studienkreis in 2022 indicates its evolution towards a more comprehensive educational platform. Studienkreis has physical learning centers that GoStudent can leverage to enhance hybrid learning. CEO Felix Ohswald believes that the future of education is hybrid, and technology can help match students with the right tutors regardless of location.

Most of GoStudent's tutors are university students, which enables them to connect with pupils more effectively. The company's focus on personalized education and its emphasis on hybrid learning will be crucial as it aims to grow while keeping costs in check. GoStudent's journey to profitability has been challenging, but by making strategic changes and focusing on its core strengths, the company has positioned itself for long-term success.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Founders-of-GoStudent-Gregor-Muller-I-Felix-Ohswald-2.jpg?w=1024,2024-03-25 11:00:36,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/london-regtech-gss-raises-47m-to-help-banks-screen-for-global-sanctions/,London regtech GSS raises $47M to help banks screen for global sanctions,"Global Screening Services (GSS), a London-based regulatory compliance platform, has successfully raised $47 million in a recent funding round. The timing of this raise is particularly significant, as there has been a surge in economic sanctions imposed by the United States on countries such as Russia, China, Iran, and more.

GSS was founded by Tom Scampion, who previously served as the head of financial crime for Deloitte's EMEA arm. In 2020, Scampion left Deloitte to become a general partner at consulting firm AlixPartner. It was during his time at AlixPartner that GSS was incubated before becoming an independent entity in 2021.

Last year, GSS secured a similar amount of funding from prominent investors, including Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), one of the largest banks in the world. In this latest round, GSS has attracted the support of another financial powerhouse, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), along with Cynosure Group and AlixPartner.

Financial institutions, particularly banks, often find themselves at the forefront of sanctions enforcement due to their role in managing global money flows. However, identifying the parties involved in financial transactions can be a complex task. For instance, in 2019, Standard Chartered faced fines of $1.1 billion from regulators in the UK and the US for inadequate money-laundering controls and breaching sanctions against countries like Iran. Similarly, BNP Paribas was fined a staggering $8.9 billion in 2014 for processing financial transactions related to sanctioned countries.

Given the increased focus on regulatory compliance, investors have been supporting businesses in this sector. For example, Droit, based in New York, raised $23 million last year, while London's SteelEye secured $21 million in financing.

GSS offers a sanctions-screening platform that assists banks and other financial institutions in complying with regulations. These institutions input transaction data into GSS's cloud-based platform, which then alerts them if there is a match against a standardized set of sanctions lists from around the world. GSS also enhances these lists by adding additional data points, such as dates of birth, International Maritime Organization (IMO) numbers for ships, and data from the local financial transfer systems of sanctioned countries like Russia and China.

Moreover, GSS provides ""enhanced"" lists for screening, including companies that have partial ownership by individuals, companies, or governments subject to sanctions by organizations like the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the European Union (EU), or the United Kingdom.

With the recent funding of $47 million, GSS is now transitioning from the development phase to becoming fully operational. The company is gearing up to launch its platform for its first set of customers.

In conclusion, GSS has successfully raised $47 million in funding to support its regulatory compliance platform. With the backing of notable investors, including the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, GSS is well-positioned to assist financial institutions in meeting their global sanctions obligations. As the company prepares to go live, it marks a significant milestone in its journey towards ensuring effective compliance in an increasingly complex regulatory landscape.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1770041999-e1711386339681.jpg?resize=1200,677",2024-03-25 18:36:37,Innovation,Innovation
