https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-liquid-iron-battery-grid-energy.html,New all-liquid iron flow battery for grid energy storage,"A New Battery Design for Large-Scale Energy Storage

Researchers at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have repurposed a commonplace chemical used in water treatment facilities to create a new battery design for large-scale energy storage. This design offers a safe, economical, water-based, and flow battery that is made with Earth-abundant materials. It provides a promising solution for integrating intermittent energy sources like wind and solar energy into the electric grid.

The researchers, led by battery researcher Gabriel Nambafu, have published their findings in the journal Nature Communications. Their lab-scale, iron-based battery demonstrated remarkable cycling stability over one thousand consecutive charging cycles, while maintaining 98.7% of its maximum capacity. This is a significant improvement compared to previous studies, which reported a degradation of charge capacity two orders of magnitude higher over fewer charging cycles.

Iron-based flow batteries have been in development since the 1980s, and some are already available commercially. However, what sets this battery apart is its unique liquid chemical formula for storing energy. It combines charged iron with a neutral-pH phosphate-based liquid electrolyte, known as nitrogenous triphosphonate (NTMPA). The key advantage of NTMPA is that it is commercially available in industrial quantities due to its use in inhibiting corrosion in water treatment plants.

NTMPA belongs to a broader chemical family called phosphonates, which are based on the element phosphorus. Many phosphonates, including NTMPA, dissolve well in water and are nontoxic. They are commonly used in fertilizers, detergents, and other applications.

To modernize the U.S. electric grid and effectively store energy from renewable sources like wind and solar power, new flow battery technologies are necessary. Flow batteries consist of two chambers filled with different liquids. They charge through an electrochemical reaction and store energy in chemical bonds. When connected to an external circuit, they release the stored energy, which can power electrical devices. Unlike conventional batteries, flow batteries have two external supply tanks of liquid that constantly circulate through them, serving as the battery system's ""blood supply."" The larger the electrolyte supply tank, the more energy the flow battery can store.

Flow batteries can act as backup generators for the electric grid and play a crucial role in decarbonization strategies that aim to store energy from renewable resources. One of their advantages is that they can be built at any scale, from small lab-bench setups to large systems that can power entire cities.

In the short term, grid operators are interested in installing battery energy storage systems (BESS) in urban or suburban areas close to energy consumers. However, safety concerns often arise in these densely populated areas. The aqueous flow battery developed by the research team at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory could help address these concerns. It operates in water with a neutral pH, which enhances safety. Additionally, the system uses commercially available reagents that have not been previously explored for use in flow batteries.

The initial design developed by the researchers has an energy density of up to 9 watt-hours per liter (Wh/L). Although commercialized vanadium-based systems have higher energy density, at 25 Wh/L, it is important to note that higher energy density batteries require more space. A system built with Earth-abundant materials could be scaled up to provide the same energy output in a smaller footprint.

The future development of flow batteries holds great promise for large-scale energy storage. The research conducted by the team at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory demonstrates the potential of using a commonplace chemical to create a safe, economical, and water-based flow battery. With further advancements and optimization, flow batteries could play a vital role in the transition to a sustainable energy future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/new-all-liquid-iron-fl.jpg,2024-03-25 07:22:25,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2024/03/26/can-ai-amplify-esprit-de-corps/,Can AI Amplify Esprit De Corps?,"Can AI bring us together? That's the question many experts and observers are asking as they explore the potential of artificial intelligence to unify teams and foster collaboration. While data-driven decision-making has become a common practice in sports and business, there is a growing recognition that there is an ""X factor"" beyond data that can elevate teams to new heights.

In the early 1980s, Dr. Peter Senge conducted a study on the Los Angeles Lakers, one of the most successful basketball teams of the previous decade. He found that the key to their success was a shared vision and a deep understanding of each other's intentions. This notion of a common vision is now being revisited with a new twist – the integration of artificial intelligence.

AI has the potential to serve as a unifying force for teams, helping to align members and enhance their understanding of each other's feelings and motivations. Unlike a basketball team that needs to be physically present on the court, business teams can be spread across the globe. AI can bridge the distance and facilitate collaboration.

Dr. Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic suggests thinking of AI as ""artificial emotional intelligence"" or AEI. It involves computers trying to understand how we feel and think, a fundamental aspect of human emotional intelligence. For example, natural language processing can analyze teammates' language to estimate their morale, engagement, and enthusiasm, providing valuable insights for managers.

AI can also scrape body language during video meetings, giving team members a sense of how others are feeling. It's like a Shazam for the soul, helping to bridge the gap of physical distance and create a sense of connection.

However, AI still has some way to go before it can fully bring teams into alignment. Currently, AI is primarily focused on enhancing individual productivity rather than team collaboration. While it can take on administrative tasks like notetaking and transcription, or provide real-time translation, it is not yet optimized to foster team cohesion.

Yingqi Wang, CEO and founder of ONES, a project management software provider, compares much of today's AI usage to ""shadow IT"" with collaborative functionalities. As AI becomes more widely adopted and reliable, it has the potential to reshape the way teams approach tasks and break down barriers to collaboration and communication.

But there is a caveat – humans cannot over-rely on AI. While AI can streamline processes and suggest relevant information, it should not replace human interaction and spontaneous collaboration. Over-automation can diminish human touch and hinder true innovation. As AI takes on more administrative roles, it is essential to dial up our people skills and maintain open lines of communication with both human and synthetic team members.

Additionally, we must be cautious of relying too heavily on data-driven creativity. While data can provide valuable insights, it should not stifle true innovation and creativity. Team dynamics and the human element need to be nurtured and explored alongside AI's evolving role.

In conclusion, AI has the potential to bring teams together by enhancing alignment, understanding, and collaboration. By leveraging artificial emotional intelligence, teams can bridge physical distance and achieve a shared vision. However, it is crucial to strike a balance between AI and human interaction to maintain team cohesion and foster true innovation. As we continue to explore the possibilities of AI, we must remember that it is a tool to enhance teamwork, not a substitute for human connection.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66025c981748a83933081202/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-26 01:28:39,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.zdnet.com/article/saving-hours-of-work-with-ai-how-chatgpt-became-my-virtual-assistant-for-a-data-project/,Saving hours of work with AI: How ChatGPT became my virtual assistant for a data project,"Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been a hot topic lately, with tools like ChatGPT gaining a lot of attention. While these tools are certainly impressive, it's important to remember that they are just that - tools. They can be helpful in streamlining projects and saving time, much like other productivity software.

In this article, I want to share a project where ChatGPT proved to be a valuable asset. Although your specific project may not require the same approach, I hope that my thought process and prompts can inspire you to leverage ChatGPT as a workhorse tool for your own projects.

Let's dive into the project I undertook. In the coming month, I plan to publish what I call a ""stunt article."" These articles are meant to be fun and intriguing for readers. The particular article I'm working on involves showcasing how much computer gear I can purchase from Temu for under $100. I managed to come in at a total of $99.77.

To compile this article, I had to search the Temu website for items to feature. For example, I found an iPad keyboard and mouse combo that only cost about $6. To stay within my budget, I needed to add all the Temu links to a spreadsheet, find the prices for each item, and then rearrange things until I reached my desired total budget.

The challenge I faced was converting the Temu links into a more usable format. This is where ChatGPT came to the rescue.

Phase 1: Gathering the links
First, I collected all the links by copying them from the Temu website and pasting them into a Notion page. Notion offers the option to create bookmark blocks that not only contain the links but also include the product names. Here's a snapshot of the page:

[Insert snapshot of Notion page]

As you can see, I began selecting the blocks. Once I had them all selected, I copied them and pasted the entire set into a text editor. It may not look pretty, but it gets the job done.

Phase 2: Identifying the data
Let's take a closer look at one of the data blocks. I've switched my editor to light mode, so it's easier for you to see the data elements within the block:

[Insert snapshot of data block]

There are three key elements here. The gold text represents the product name, enclosed in braces. The green text is the base URL of the product, enclosed in parentheses. There's also a question mark that separates the main page URL from any additional tracking data passed to the Temu page. For this project, I only needed the main URL. The purple sections highlight the delimiters, which are the data we will feed into ChatGPT.

Phase 3: Teaching ChatGPT to recognize the data
First, I provided ChatGPT with the following prompt:
""Accept the following data and await further instructions.""

Then, I copied all the information from the text editor and pasted it into ChatGPT. At this point, ChatGPT understood that there would be more details to come.

The next step was the core of the project. I wanted ChatGPT to extract the titles and links while discarding the rest. Here's the prompt I used:

""The data above consists of a series of blocks. Each block begins with a section enclosed in [] brackets, which represents the title. Following the brackets is an open parenthesis (followed by a web URL). For each block, extract the URL, but disregard everything after the question mark, including the question mark itself. Most URLs will end in .html. Display the title, followed by a carriage return, the URL, and two newlines.""

This process served two purposes. First, it allowed me to assign names to the data, making it easier to refer to later. Second, it served as a test to ensure that ChatGPT understood the assignment.

ChatGPT successfully completed the assignment but stopped about two-thirds of the way through due to buffer limitations. I prompted the bot to continue, and it provided me with the remaining data. If I had done this manually, it would have been a tedious process of copying and pasting. ChatGPT completed the task in less than a minute.

Phase 4: Cleaning up Temu's titles
For my project, the titles provided by Temu were too long and complex. Instead of something like:

""10 Inch LCD Writing Tablet, Electronis Memo With Leather Protective Case, Electronic Drawing Board For Digital Handwriting Pad Doodle Board, Gifts For""

I wanted something simpler and more concise, like:

""LCD writing tablet with case""

I assigned this task to ChatGPT as well. I reminded the tool that it had previously parsed and identified the data. I find that reminding ChatGPT about previous steps helps it incorporate the information more reliably.

When most people think of Amazon, they envision a delivery truck bringing a package to their door. However, Amazon is much more than just a delivery service. It is one of the most innovative companies in the world, heavily investing in infrastructure, supply chain management, IT, and transportation.

What many people may not realize is that Amazon has been incorporating AI and machine learning into its processes long before these terms became popular buzzwords. Now, Amazon is taking its AI expertise and bringing it into classrooms and virtual learning experiences. We had the privilege of sitting down with Victor Reinoso, the global director of education philanthropy at Amazon, to discuss the future of education and AI. Reinoso, who was previously the deputy mayor of Washington D.C., brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to this topic.

Victor Reinoso has always been passionate about educating and training students in computer science disciplines to prepare them for future careers. Before joining Amazon in 2020, he championed this initiative in various roles across venture capitalism, consulting, and as the D.C. deputy mayor for education. At Amazon, Reinoso is able to combine these experiences to invest in innovations and nonprofit partnerships that will better prepare and inspire young people for the careers of tomorrow.

One major challenge schools face in integrating AI education into their curriculums is the lack of resources and knowledge among educators. While there is a strong desire to teach AI content to students, many teachers struggle to access the necessary tools and training. According to a recent survey conducted by Amazon and Access Partnership, 70% of educators lack the resources to teach foundational AI skills, despite 60% believing that these skills should be taught from Grade 6 through university.

AI is becoming increasingly prevalent in our daily lives, and it is crucial that students are equipped with the skills to navigate this technology. To bridge the AI education gap, funding for educator training is essential. Amazon funds professional development for teachers, helping them implement sustainable STEM education initiatives and improve job readiness among students.

In addition to training, increasing access to tools and curriculum is vital. Amazon recognizes this and has launched several initiatives to provide free AI resources. For example, the Hour of Code Dance Party: AI Edition is a collaboration with Code.org that introduces K-12 students and teachers to coding and generative AI. Amazon Web Services (AWS) Generative AI Scholarships offer more than 50,000 high school and university students globally the opportunity to access a new generative AI course on Udacity for free. Professionals in the workplace can also benefit from the eight new and free AI and generative AI courses offered by Amazon.

While integrating AI education into curriculums is crucial, it is equally important to teach students how to use AI responsibly. Responsible AI use should be a critical part of the curriculum, and educators recognize its significance. As AI continues to evolve, responsible stewards will play a pivotal role in guiding its application.

In conclusion, Amazon is not just a delivery service but a pioneer in AI and machine learning. Through initiatives like free AI resources and educator training, Amazon is working to bridge the AI education gap and prepare students for the future. With the guidance of responsible stewards, AI can be harnessed for the benefit of society. The future of education and AI is bright, and Amazon is at the forefront of this exciting journey.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/08bc5883c45c188259ecb098a51ea114dc119601/2024/03/25/38b15b64-4b2d-45b8-8147-39fda8737c67/amazon-future-engineer-career-discovery-day-20231024-bsd-students-1010.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 10:59:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/900care-raises-23-million-for-its-waterless-personal-care-products/,900.care sells waterless personal care products and lets you add tap water at home,"Here’s a stark reality about personal care products: most of what you're buying is water and plastic. When you purchase a bottle of shampoo or shower gel, the primary ingredient is water. It's then mixed with a variety of active ingredients. These pre-mixed products require companies to invest a significant amount of money in plastic bottles to transport them to your bathroom.

However, French startup 900.care is looking to change the game. Instead of purchasing a new bottle of shower gel or shampoo each time you need it, this startup focuses on the active ingredients themselves.

When you place your first order with 900.care, you receive an empty, reusable plastic bottle equipped with a pump. Inside the bottle, you place a small stick of compacted powder and add some water. After a few hours, the product is ready to use. The next time you need more shower gel or shampoo, all you require is a new stick and some tap water.

Co-founder and CEO Aymeric Grange explains, ""You still get all the benefits of using shower gel, such as lather, texture, and a pleasant scent. But you haven't purchased any plastic, nor have you had to transport any water.""

This innovative approach has proven successful in 900.care's home country, resulting in a recent funding round of €21 million ($23 million). Lombard Odier Investment Managers is leading the funding, with existing investors White Star Capital, Swen Blue Ocean, and Founders Future also participating.

900.care has followed the direct-to-consumer model, allowing customers to purchase its products exclusively through its website. As personal care products are items people consistently need, the company has decided to offer its products through subscriptions only.

In 2023, 900.care generated €10 million ($10.8 million) in revenue alone. The startup currently boasts 90,000 clients with 235,000 active subscriptions. Each client can have multiple subscriptions.

In addition to shampoo and shower gel, 900.care also sells foaming hand soap, dish soap, laundry and dishwasher tablets, and a few other products. The company estimates that it has prevented the equivalent of 3.5 million plastic bottles from becoming waste.

Now, let's delve into the fine details.

900.care's products not only benefit the environment but also present a lucrative business opportunity. Customers receive envelopes every few weeks containing new sticks for their hygiene and home products. Due to the compact size of these powder sticks, they can be easily mailed in a standard envelope without incurring high shipping fees. This saves 900.care money on shipping costs.

Additionally, the compact nature of the powder sticks allows for smaller factories and production lines. Unlike traditional personal care products that require large basins for mixing water and active ingredients, 900.care only needs to combine various powders and compress the mixture into tiny sticks.

""At the compacting and industrialization stage, our biggest challenge was finding the right expertise. Initially, we partnered with individuals involved in the cosmetics industry,"" Grange explained. ""However, we quickly realized this approach wasn't sustainable. They couldn't keep up with our pace, and their factories were not designed for our needs. In the second quarter of 2023, we opened a factory in Saint-Etienne dedicated to compacted powder production.""

While this new factory operates under a partner, it has been specifically tailored to meet 900.care's requirements. This optimization has greatly improved the company's profit margins.

900.care anticipates reaching €100 million in revenue within the next three years as it expands to other European countries beyond France, Belgium, and Switzerland. The company also expects to turn a profit this year.

In summary, 900.care has revolutionized the personal care industry by focusing on the active ingredients rather than selling water and plastic. By providing customers with compacted powder sticks and reusable bottles, the company eliminates the need for excessive packaging and transportation. With its successful direct-to-consumer model and commitment to sustainability, 900.care is making waves in the industry and poised for further growth in the coming years.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mousse-Mains-1.jpg?resize=1200,690",2024-03-26 05:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-semiconductors-scale-processor-remarkable-speedup.html,Semiconductors at scale: New processor achieves remarkable speedup in problem solving,"Annealing processors are specialized for solving combinatorial optimization problems, making them valuable in various fields such as logistics, resource allocation, and drug discovery. However, the scalability of these processors is directly impacted by the complexity of their components.

In a recent study published in IEEE Access and presented at the 22nd World Symposium on Applied Machine Intelligence and Informatics, Professor Takayuki Kawahara and his team from Tokyo University of Science introduced a scalable processor that divides calculations among multiple LSI chips. This breakthrough allows for advanced information processing directly at the edge, eliminating the need for cloud-based preprocessing.

The researchers utilized a unique processing architecture developed by Tokyo University of Science in 2020, which enabled the creation of a fully coupled LSI chip using 28nm CMOS technology. They also developed a scalable method that utilizes parallel-operating chips, demonstrating its feasibility with FPGAs in 2022.

The team successfully created a scalable annealing processor using 36 22nm CMOS calculation LSI chips and one control FPGA. This processor follows the Ising model, a mathematical model of magnetic systems, and incorporates two technologies developed at Tokyo University of Science. The first is the ""spin thread method,"" which allows for eight parallel solution searches. The second is a technique that reduces chip requirements by approximately half compared to conventional methods. The processor operates at a power consumption of 2.9W (1.3W for the core part) and a frequency of 10MHz. These specifications were confirmed through practical experiments involving a vertex cover problem with 4096 vertices.

The power performance ratio of the processor outperforms simulating a fully coupled Ising system on a PC using annealing emulation by 2,306 times. It also surpasses the core CPU and arithmetic chip by 2,186 times. This successful verification suggests the potential for further capacity enhancements.

Looking ahead, Professor Kawahara envisions the social implementation of this technology through business initiatives, joint research efforts, and technology transfer. He aims to develop this technology to create an LSI system with computing power equivalent to a 2050-level quantum computer for solving combinatorial optimization problems. The goal is to achieve this using current semiconductor processes without the need for air conditioning, large equipment, or cloud infrastructure. By 2030, the team aims to achieve 2 million spins and explore the creation of new digital industries.

In conclusion, the researchers at Tokyo University of Science have developed a scalable annealing processor that incorporates 4096 spins on a single board with 36 CMOS chips. Key innovations, including chip reduction and parallel operations for simultaneous solution searches, have played a crucial role in this development. This breakthrough opens up new possibilities for solving combinatorial optimization problems and paves the way for future advancements in information processing.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/semiconductors-at-scal.jpg,2024-03-25 13:50:03,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/03/25/3-motivations-behind-cosplaying-according-to-a-psychologist/,"3 Motivations Behind ‘Cosplaying,’ According To A Psychologist","Cosplay: Becoming the Best Version of Ourselves

If you've ever dressed up for Halloween, you know the excitement of becoming someone else, even if just for a night. But for some people, it's not just a once-a-year event; it's a lifestyle. Welcome to the world of cosplay - a vibrant subculture where individuals don elaborate costumes and embody fictional personas from various forms of media. It's not just about dressing up; it's a passion and an art form that allows people to become the best version of themselves through the act of becoming someone else.

What is Cosplay?

Cosplay, short for ""costume play,"" is a phenomenon that has taken the world by storm. From comic books and anime to video games and movies, cosplayers immerse themselves in the worlds of their favorite media franchises. They meticulously recreate the costumes, hairstyles, makeup, and accessories of their chosen characters, striving for accuracy and authenticity. But it doesn't stop there - cosplaying also involves embodying the personality, mannerisms, and unique traits of the character being portrayed. It's all about bringing these fictional characters to life and celebrating the fandom that surrounds them.

Popular Characters and Source Material

When it comes to cosplay, the possibilities are endless. From the iconic superheroes like Superman, Batman, and Spider-Man to the villains like Harley Quinn and the Joker, there's a character for everyone. Disney characters, the Harry Potter world, and the Star Wars universe also provide rich source material for cosplayers. Whether it's Darth Vader, Princess Leia, or Luke Skywalker, these characters have captured the hearts of fans worldwide. And let's not forget about anime and manga - Naruto Uzumaki from ""Naruto,"" Goku from ""Dragon Ball Z,"" Sailor Moon from ""Sailor Moon,"" and Luffy from ""One Piece"" are just a few of the popular choices among cosplayers.

Why Do People Cosplay?

Research has shed light on the motivations behind cosplay, revealing three key reasons why people engage in this transformative hobby.

1. Creative Self-Expression: Authentic self-expression is associated with greater life satisfaction, and cosplay provides an outlet for creative expression. It allows individuals to celebrate their favorite fandoms and express their passion for fictional characters and stories. Cosplaying is a means of exploring different facets of one's identity, experimenting with personas and aspects that may not be easily expressed in everyday life. It's a chance to momentarily change identity, creating an exciting and extraordinary self. As one cosplayer puts it, ""I'm no longer a passive reader or video game player.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/bankrupt-ev-startup-arrival-sold-its-assets-to-canoo/,Bankrupt EV startup Arrival sold its assets to Canoo,"Bankrupt electric vehicle (EV) startup Arrival has sold some of its assets, including advanced manufacturing equipment, to Canoo, another struggling startup in the EV industry. This acquisition is seen as a cost-saving measure for Canoo, as it aims to reduce capital expenditures by 20%. Canoo plans to send the purchased assets, which have been packed into over 20 container ships, to its facility in Oklahoma. The company has already acquired all of Arrival's new and ""like-new"" assets in the United States. It remains uncertain whether Canoo has also acquired any of Arrival's intellectual property (IP).

Arrival had previously announced its intention to sell off assets and IP from its U.K. division after filing for bankruptcy protection. Once valued at over $13 billion and backed by Hyundai and UPS, Arrival aimed to revolutionize EV production by building compact ""microfactories"" in city centers. The company had plans for an electric bus, vans, and even a purpose-built car for Uber. However, Arrival faced financial difficulties, burned through cash, and experienced executive turnover. It restructured multiple times, resulting in layoffs. To preserve capital, Arrival shifted its focus from the U.K. market to the United States. Despite its ambitious plans, Arrival never achieved large-scale production of commercial vehicles, and its market valuation has now plummeted to around $7.7 million. After years of volatility and a significant decline in share price, the company ultimately filed for bankruptcy.

Canoo has also faced its own set of challenges. After going public through a merger, the company struggled to produce its distinctive EV design, which utilizes a ""skateboard"" architecture to house batteries and the electric drivetrain. Canoo previously reported a sales pipeline worth over $1 billion, largely due to a deal with Walmart to purchase 4,500 units, with the option to acquire up to 10,000 units. However, Canoo has encountered difficulties in converting these sales into actual deliveries. As a pre-revenue company burning through cash, Canoo has resorted to stock splits and issuing more shares to maintain its financial stability. Last year, the company moved to a different tier in the Nasdaq Exchange after its stock price dipped below $1, triggering a delisting notice.

In summary, Arrival's sale of assets to Canoo represents a cost-saving measure for the struggling EV startup. Both companies have faced significant challenges in their respective journeys. Arrival's bankruptcy filing and Canoo's difficulties in producing and delivering its EVs underscore the competitive and volatile nature of the EV industry. As they navigate through these obstacles, it remains to be seen how these startups will fare in the future.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/canoo-walmart-arkansas.jpg?resize=1200,670",2024-03-25 22:15:20,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-method-quantum-mechanics-lithium-metal.html,New method that uses quantum mechanics can lead to improved lithium metal batteries,"In a recent study published in Nature Energy, Dr. Perla Balbuena and Dr. Jorge Seminario, professors in the Artie McFerrin Department of Chemical Engineering at Texas A&M University, have made significant progress in understanding the effects of external pressure on lithium-metal batteries using quantum mechanics. By gaining a deeper understanding of how lithium ions behave under pressure, researchers hope to improve the fabrication processes of lithium-metal batteries and develop more efficient and longer-lasting battery technologies.

Dr. Balbuena described the study as a ""beautiful demonstration of the impact of first-principles ab initio analysis on the design of macroscopic processes."" She also highlighted the potential applications of similar methods in various fields, such as chemical engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, materials science, and biology.

This research is part of the ongoing work under the Battery500 Consortium, a collaborative effort between national laboratories and academia focused on developing more reliable and high-performing vehicle batteries. Led by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, the consortium aims to achieve the goals set by the Department of Energy.

Lithium-ion batteries have played a pivotal role in revolutionizing mobile electronics and enabling the development of compact devices that can easily fit in our pockets. They are widely used in smartphones, watches, toys, laptops, electric vehicles, and power grids. However, these batteries still face several challenges, with one of the most significant being their limited energy density, which is determined by the battery components.

According to Dr. Seminario, lithium-ion batteries work by converting lithium ions into neutral species and storing their energy as chemical energy. The two essential electrodes in these batteries are the anode (the negative electrode) and the cathode (the positive electrode). The anode contains lithium ions with maximum energy, while the cathode holds lithium ions with minimum energy. This energy difference drives the migration of lithium ions from the anode to the cathode during discharge, allowing the transfer of energy as electrical energy.

To overcome the limitations of current lithium-ion batteries, researchers are exploring alternative materials. One promising approach is replacing the conventional graphite anode with lithium metal, which could potentially enhance the energy density by a factor of ten within the anode. However, lithium metal is highly reactive, requiring innovative control measures, such as applying external pressure to the battery.

While external pressure has been found to significantly impact cell performance, there is a lack of research exploring the relationship between external pressure and the electroplating of lithium in large-format pouch cells. Additionally, during the cycling process, the battery's components may experience volume changes, leading to cell swelling and affecting battery performance and cycle life.

Dr. Balbuena and her team focused their research on understanding how pressure influences the distribution of lithium ions on the anode and prevents the formation of dendrites, which are needle-like structures that can potentially cause short circuits in the battery. By employing theoretical-computational techniques, the Texas A&M team analyzed the precise effects of pressure on lithium-metal anodes.

Through their research, the team discovered that lithium ions tend to detour towards regions with elevated pressure or a higher concentration of lithium atoms on the surface. This behavior is a result of the electric field generated by the lithium-metal anode. This finding allows researchers to predict the behavior of novel materials proposed as components for advanced applications. Being able to predict ion behavior under these conditions could lead to the widespread use of lithium-metal batteries with lower costs, improved fabrication processes, longer battery life, and increased functionality.

The research conducted by Dr. Balbuena and Dr. Seminario provides valuable insights into the behavior of lithium ions under pressure in lithium-metal batteries. Their study paves the way for further advancements in battery technology and the development of more efficient and longer-lasting batteries. By utilizing quantum mechanics and computational techniques, researchers can continue to explore alternative materials and improve the performance of lithium-metal batteries, bringing us closer to a future with more reliable and high-performing energy storage solutions.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/new-discovery-can-lead.jpg,2024-03-25 17:06:08,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/london-regtech-gss-raises-47m-to-help-banks-screen-for-global-sanctions/,London regtech GSS raises $47M to help banks screen for global sanctions,"Global Screening Services (GSS), a London-based regulatory compliance platform, has recently secured $47 million in funding. The increase in economic sanctions, particularly by the U.S. against countries like Russia, China, and Iran, has created a greater need for financial institutions to meet their global sanctions obligations.

GSS was initially incubated within consulting firm AlixPartner before becoming an independent entity in 2021. The company's co-founder and CEO, Tom Scampion, previously served as the head of financial crime for Deloitte's EMEA arm. Last year, GSS raised a similar amount of funding, with investors including Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), one of the world's largest banks. In this latest funding round, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) has joined as a backer, along with Cynosure Group and AlixPartner.

Financial institutions often face challenges in identifying and preventing money laundering and sanctions violations. For example, in 2019, Standard Chartered was fined $1.1 billion for inadequate money-laundering controls and breaching sanctions against Iran. Similarly, BNP Paribas was fined $8.9 billion in 2014 for processing financial transactions for sanctioned countries.

In response to these challenges, investors have shown interest in regulatory compliance businesses. Last year, New York-based Droit raised $23 million, and London's SteelEye secured $21 million in financing.

GSS offers a sanctions-screening platform that helps banks and financial institutions comply with regulations. Users input transaction data into GSS's cloud-based platform, which compares the data against a standardized set of sanctions lists from around the world. GSS also enhances these lists with additional data, such as dates of birth, International Maritime Organization (IMO) numbers for ships, and information from the financial transfer systems of sanctioned countries.

Additionally, GSS provides ""enhanced"" lists that include companies partially owned by individuals, companies, or governments subject to sanctions by organizations like the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the European Union (EU), or the United Kingdom (U.K.).

With the recent funding, GSS is transitioning from the development phase to becoming fully operational. The company is preparing to launch its services to its first customers.

Overall, GSS's innovative platform and its ability to help financial institutions navigate the complex landscape of global sanctions make it a valuable solution in the industry. With the financial backing and support from major institutions like CBA, GSS is well-positioned to make a significant impact in regulatory compliance.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1770041999-e1711386339681.jpg?resize=1200,677",2024-03-25 18:36:37,Innovation,Innovation
