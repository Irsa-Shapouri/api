Having recently passed the Artificial Intelligence Act, the European Union is set to implement some of the world's strictest AI regulations. The Act designates certain AI applications as ""unacceptable"" and will make them illegal, with exceptions for government, law enforcement, and scientific study under specific conditions. Similar to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), this new legislation will impose obligations on businesses operating within the 27 EU member states, regardless of their location.

The primary goal of the AI Act is to safeguard citizens' rights and freedoms while fostering innovation and entrepreneurship. However, the Act's 460 pages contain more than just these principles. For businesses operating in Europe or targeting European consumers, it is crucial to be aware of the key takeaways and prepare for potential significant changes.

Effective Date and Enforcement

The EU Parliament adopted the Artificial Intelligence Act on March 13, and it is expected to become law once passed by the European Council. Full enforcement of the Act will take up to 24 months, but certain aspects, such as the ban on specific AI practices, could be enforced within six months.

Similar to GDPR, this grace period allows companies to ensure compliance. After the deadline, companies may face substantial penalties for any breaches, with the most severe penalties reserved for those violating the ban on ""unacceptable uses."" Violators could be fined up to 30 million euros or six percent of the company's global turnover, whichever is higher. Additionally, non-compliance may damage a business's reputation, leading to further consequences as consumer trust in AI is paramount.

Banned Uses of AI

The AI Act emphasizes that AI should be human-centric and serve as a tool to enhance human well-being. Consequently, the EU has prohibited several potentially harmful uses of AI. These include:

1. Using AI to influence or change behaviors in harmful ways.
2. Biometric classification to infer political, religious, or sexual beliefs.
3. Social scoring systems that may lead to discrimination.
4. Remote identification of individuals through biometrics in public places, such as facial recognition systems.

While there are exemptions, such as situations where law enforcement organizations can utilize ""unacceptable"" AIs to prevent terrorism or locate missing persons, the Act prioritizes limiting AI's potential to cause harm. However, there is some ambiguity in the language used, which may require further guidance or clarification. For instance, the Act does not explicitly address whether targeted marketing for fast food and high-sugar soft drinks could be considered harmful behavior influence. Additionally, determining whether a social scoring system leads to discrimination in a world where credit checks and scoring are common is a complex issue.

High-Risk AI

In addition to prohibited uses, the AI Act categorizes AI tools into three risk levels: high, limited, and minimal risk. High-risk AI includes applications like self-driving cars and medical applications. Businesses operating in these high-risk fields will face stricter rules and greater obligations regarding data quality and protection.

On the other hand, limited and minimal-risk AI use cases may involve entertainment applications like video games or creative processes such as text, video, or sound generation. These use cases will have fewer requirements, but transparency and ethical use of intellectual property will still be expected.

Transparency

The AI Act emphasizes the importance of transparency in AI systems. However, there is some ambiguity, particularly regarding the protection of trade secrets and confidential business information. It remains uncertain how this aspect will be interpreted in court cases.

The Act addresses transparency in two ways. Firstly, it emphasizes the need for transparency in AI systems, but exceptions may exist to protect trade secrets and confidential business information. Secondly, the Act requires certain AI systems to be accompanied by detailed documentation, including information on the system's purpose, capabilities, limitations, and potential risks.

Conclusion

The European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act introduces stringent regulations to ensure the responsible use of AI technology while protecting citizens' rights and freedoms. Businesses operating in Europe or targeting European consumers must familiarize themselves with the Act's key takeaways and prepare for potential changes. Understanding the effective date, banned uses of AI, risk categorization, and transparency requirements will help businesses navigate this new regulatory landscape successfully.

As the AI Act becomes law, it is essential for CEOs and businesses to prioritize compliance, not only to avoid penalties but also to maintain consumer trust. AI has the potential to revolutionize industries and enhance human well-being, but its responsible and ethical use is crucial for a sustainable future.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660119636c929844c48ce7dd/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 02:28:31,Innovation,Innovation

America is currently experiencing a golden age of eclipses, and this week's celestial event is a prelude to the main event happening next week. In the early hours of Monday, March 25, the full worm moon will be slightly eclipsed by Earth, resulting in a penumbral lunar eclipse. Although not a full ""blood moon"" total lunar eclipse, this event is crucial because it sets the stage for a total solar eclipse on Monday, April 8, 2024. Missing this upcoming solar eclipse is not an option, so here are some planning tips to ensure you don't miss out.

In addition to the eclipse, there are other exciting things happening in the night sky this week. The waning gibbous moon will pass near a couple of bright stars as it rises later and later at night, making the early evening skies perfect for stargazing by the weekend.

Here's a breakdown of what you can expect to see this week:

Monday, March 25: 'Worm Moon Lunar Eclipse'
The third full moon of 2024, known as the ""Worm Moon,"" will move through Earth's outer shadow in space, resulting in a slight penumbral lunar eclipse. This eclipse will be visible from various parts of the world, including North and South America, Europe, East Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. In New York, the eclipse will begin at 00:53 a.m. EDT and end at 05:32 a.m. EDT, with the maximum eclipse occurring at 03:12 a.m. EDT. In Los Angeles, the eclipse will start at 9:53 p.m. PDT and end at 02:32 a.m. PDT, with the maximum eclipse happening at 00:12 a.m. EDT.

Tuesday, March 26: Moon And Spica
A few hours after sunset, you'll notice the almost full moon rising due east. However, what makes this moonrise unique is the presence of the bright star Spica, located just to the top right of the rising moon. Spica is the brightest star in the constellation Virgo and one of the 20 brightest stars in the night sky. It will be within 1.4 degrees of our natural satellite.

Saturday, March 30: Moon And Antares
If you're up late on Friday into the early hours of Saturday, look to the southeast, and you'll spot a 78%-lit waning gibbous moon less than a degree from Antares. Antares is a red supergiant star in the constellation Scorpius.

Galaxies Of The Week: Bode's And The Cigar
Ursa Minor and Ursa Major, visible in the northern sky after dark this week, are home to two stunning galaxies that can be observed with an 8-inch telescope. M81, also known as Bode's galaxy, is a large spiral galaxy located about 12 million light-years from Earth. It is one of the brightest galaxies in the night sky. M82, also known as the Cigar galaxy, is a starburst galaxy situated about 12 million light-years from Earth. It is renowned for its high star formation rate. In a telescope's field of view, you can see small, diffuse patches of light northwest of the bright star Dubhe in the Big Dipper.

Eclipse Tip Of The Week: Preparing For The Total Solar Eclipse
Less than two weeks from now, North America will be graced with a rare and beautiful celestial event—a total solar eclipse. If you haven't made plans yet, now is the time to act. Remember, you must be within the path of totality (the yellow stripe on the map provided) to experience the full effect of the eclipse. Simply being close to it won't make a significant difference. Check out the plethora of articles on my feed for recommendations on where to stay and where to witness the eclipse. Alternatively, visit websites that offer maps, simulations, and event listings to help you plan your eclipse experience.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/techcrunch-mobility-the-wheels-are-starting-to-come-off-the-fisker-ev-bus/,TechCrunch Mobility: The wheels are starting to come off the Fisker EV bus,"Welcome to TechCrunch Mobility, your source for all things transportation. In this edition, we'll be covering a range of topics, including the latest regulations affecting U.S. automakers, Uber's first investment in an Africa-founded startup, and more. So let's dive in!

First off, let's talk about the new proposed standards from the Biden Administration that will impact U.S. automakers and consumers. The Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have released separate regulations that, while softened to accommodate the industry, still impose stricter standards than before. The DOE's ""petroleum equivalency factor"" gives electric vehicles (EVs) a score under the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. This move aims to prevent automakers from facing significant fines for not meeting the CAFE standards. The EPA, on the other hand, has released tailpipe standards for 2027 to 2032 model year vehicles. These standards are technology agnostic, allowing automakers to meet them with various powertrains, not just electric vehicles. The original proposal, which required EV sales to make up 67% of the U.S. passenger vehicle market by 2032, has been revised to be less stringent. While this might not have a significant impact on EV startups like Rivian, Tesla, and Lucid, it does pose challenges for legacy automakers who are investing heavily in EVs while still profiting from internal combustion engine vehicles.

Speaking of EV startups, we have some interesting news to share. Rivian, known for its electric pickup trucks, has partnered with Tesla. The details of this partnership are still under wraps, but it's an exciting development in the EV space. Additionally, there's a startup called Candela that is making waves in the electric boat industry. With a recent funding round of $25 million, Candela aims to revolutionize the boating industry with its electric boats. It's great to see innovation in transportation extending beyond just cars.

Now, let's shift our focus to Uber and its latest investment. In a surprising move, Uber has made its first investment in an Africa-founded startup called Moove. Moove is a mobility fintech company that provides vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers. The startup recently raised $100 million in a Series B funding round led by Uber. This investment aligns with Uber's commitment to achieving a fully zero-emission fleet by 2040, as Moove has made electric vehicles a central part of its business strategy.

Finally, let's talk about a startup called Amber. This Bay Area company, founded in early 2023, has launched an aftermarket Tesla extended warranty product. In a seed round funding, Amber raised $3.18 million, with participation from Era, Primer Sazze, Alcove Fund, Virta Ventures, Global Millennial Capital, and Root & Shoot Ventures. This investment highlights the growing interest in the aftermarket space for electric vehicles.
