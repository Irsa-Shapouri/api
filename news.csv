The combination of the delicious savory dish and the sweet irony of using rabbit seems perfect. But for now, let's focus on Wordle and the new word puzzle game that I've been writing Strands guides for. It's really fun, and you can check out today's guide on my blog.

So, let's get into solving today's Wordle. Here are the hints, clues, and the answer:

Hint: Useful when dry, useless when wet.
Clue: Today's Wordle begins with a consonant.

Now, for the spoilers:

The Answer: [insert answer here]

Now, let's analyze my Wordle game. Every day, I check Wordle Bot to see how I did, and you can do the same. My initial guess was ""chain,"" which gave me a whopping 681 words. Thankfully, ""slope"" brought that number down to a more manageable 19. I decided to go with ""below"" for my next guess, even though I think it might have been a Wordle phrase before. It just felt right. And guess what? It wasn't bad! I could come up with a few more possibilities, and because of today's Strands puzzle, I guessed ""towel."" And to my surprise, it worked! Coincidence? Maybe...

Unfortunately, my competitive Wordle score was a total wash. I didn't score any points for guessing in four tries and didn't tie with the Bot either. Zeroes all around!

Now, let's talk about the etymology of the word ""towel."" It originated from the Old French term ""touaille"" in the 13th century. This Old French word is believed to have its roots in the Medieval Latin term ""tovaglia,"" which possibly derived from the Latin word ""tubicula,"" meaning ""tube"" or ""cloth."" The evolution of language reflects the usage and significance of towels in daily life, initially as a piece of cloth used for drying or wiping.

The transformation from ""touaille"" in Old French to ""towel"" in English showcases the influence of Norman French on the English language after the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. With time, many words of French origin underwent Anglicization in pronunciation and spelling, resulting in the modern English word ""towel"" that we use today. Towels have been a household staple for centuries, evolving in materials and uses, but their fundamental purpose remains the same: drying or wiping.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/23/google-upgrade-samsung-s24-s23-pixel-towards-apple-iphone-15-pro-max/,Google Suddenly Reveals Surprise Android Update That Beats iPhone,"Android and iPhone are constantly trying to outdo each other in terms of features and functionality. Recently, Google has taken a significant step forward by introducing a new feature that not only matches an existing iPhone feature but goes even further. This update is a game-changer and is coming to Android first.

One of the notable features that Google has added to Android is an emergency satellite service. This means that Android now has the same satellite SOS functionality that Apple has had for a few years. In fact, Google's offering even includes a Garmin rescue service, making it a comprehensive solution for user safety.

However, Apple's emergency SOS offering is limited to emergencies only. This means that if you're not in a life-threatening situation, you won't find much use for it. Google, on the other hand, with its latest Android 15 developer preview, is bridging this gap. It is allowing users to expand their cellular accounts to include a satellite add-on, which enables core messaging apps to use the satellite network. This means no more dropping connectivity in cellular black spots.

According to Mishaal Rahman, Android 15 DP2 adds UI elements to ensure a consistent user experience for devices that support satellite connectivity. It also introduces a new API that apps can use to detect when a device is connected to a satellite. Additionally, Android 15 allows SMS/MMS/RCS apps to use satellite connectivity for sending and receiving messages.

This last bit of news is the most exciting. Some networks have plans to add LEO satellite connectivity as an account option. This is a significant improvement compared to what we initially thought was coming. Previously, Google updated Pixel phones with a ""Satellite SOS"" feature, but now it seems there is much more in store.

Apple's satellite connectivity is more limited. With the latest iPhone models, users can connect to a satellite to text emergency services, request roadside assistance, and share their location with friends and family when they have no mobile or Wi-Fi coverage.

There were hopes that Android would go even further with satellite messaging. Previous beta code suggested a satellite messaging option in partnership with T-Mobile. Elon Musk's announcement that SpaceX achieved download speeds of 17mbps to an unmodified Galaxy S21 Ultra further fueled these expectations. This indicates that in the future, direct-to-phone satellite connectivity will become more common and usable.

For now, the integration of satellite messaging is a great start. It confirms that Android 15 will indeed include this feature. As Android and iPhone continue to converge, Google seems to be leading the way, with Apple likely to follow suit. This news comes shortly after reports that Gemini, Google's powerful AI, might be coming to iPhone.

In conclusion, Android is making significant strides to match and exceed iPhone's features. The addition of satellite messaging is a game-changer for Android users, providing them with enhanced safety and connectivity. This development further closes the gap between Android and iPhone, and it will be interesting to see how Apple responds in the future.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65d79ec3dadcd6b682668331/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-23 19:17:25,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/apple-sued-microsofts-ai-ambitions-and-nvidia-surprises/,"Apple sued, Microsoft's AI ambitions and Nvidia's surprises","Welcome to the latest edition of Week in Review, where we bring you the most significant news and updates from the tech industry. In this edition, we'll delve into the Apple antitrust lawsuit and Microsoft's AI ambitions. So, let's get started!

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has joined international regulators in accusing Apple of engaging in monopolistic tactics to lock in iPhone users. However, Apple argues that the DOJ's actions could jeopardize the very aspects that its users value about its phones and ecosystem.

While the lawsuit draws parallels between Apple and Microsoft's practices in the 1990s, there are notable differences between the two companies' efforts to retain customers. Despite this legal battle, experts predict that it will likely take several years for a resolution to be reached.

Moving on to other news, Microsoft recently acquired the co-founders of Inflection AI, a prominent AI startup. Mustafa Suleyman will now lead Microsoft's consumer-facing unit, Microsoft AI, while Karén Simonyan assumes the role of EVP and CEO of the same group. Inflection AI had previously raised $1.3 billion, with Microsoft being its largest investor.

Nvidia made waves during its GTC developer conference, with CEO Jensen Huang making surprising announcements. Huang predicted that artificial general intelligence would be achievable within the next five years. Additionally, Nvidia unveiled GR00T, a new AI platform for humanoid robots.

In a potentially groundbreaking development, Google and Apple are reportedly in talks to deploy Google's AI model on upcoming iOS updates. This raises speculation about the nature of their partnership and whether it will be a temporary arrangement until Apple's own AI efforts catch up.

In the realm of hacking and privacy, the Biden administration is forming an international coalition to combat commercial spyware. Interestingly, some investors joining the coalition have previously been involved in the very business they are now fighting against. Additionally, a recent hack disrupted a $5 million Apex Legends tournament, shedding light on a security flaw that game developers need to address.

Glassdoor, a popular job review platform, is facing criticism as users report that their real names are being added to their profiles without consent. The only solution provided to affected users is to delete their accounts entirely, prompting concerns about privacy and data protection.

Now, let's turn our attention to funding and IPOs. Reddit's initial public offering (IPO) had a strong start, with its stock surging 48% on the first day of trading. Astera Labs, a company specializing in connectivity hardware for cloud computing data centers, also experienced significant success, with its stock closing 72% higher on day one.

Lastly, The Browser Company, the startup behind the Arc browser, has raised $50 million in funding. While the company has launched numerous features and AI updates, its path to monetization remains unclear.

In our bonus round, we explore why AI often struggles with spelling, despite its vast potential. Additionally, Fisker, an electric vehicle manufacturer, has paused production due to financial difficulties. Without additional capital, the company's operations may come to a halt.

In conclusion, the tech industry is abuzz with significant developments. From the Apple antitrust lawsuit to Microsoft's AI endeavors, there is much to follow. Stay tuned for more updates in the next edition of Week in Review.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/apple-antitrust-doj-splash.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-23 20:15:37,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianmazique/2024/03/23/ufcs-dana-white-cuts-fighter-immediately-after-he-bit-an-opponent/,UFC’s Dana White Cuts Fighter Immediately After He Bit An Opponent,"Pressure and combat sports can push athletes to extreme measures. The most recent incident occurred at UFC Fight Night: Ribas vs. Namajunas, where Igor Severino made his UFC debut. However, his debut was marred by an unsportsmanlike act - he bit his opponent, Andre Lima, in the second round of their preliminary bout.

The bite, which was captured on camera and clearly showed bite marks on Lima's arm, occurred while Severino was in a standing grappling position behind Lima. This act of aggression led to Severino's disqualification from the fight. It was a shocking and disgraceful display of sportsmanship.

Severino, a 20-year-old prospect, had a chance to make a name for himself in the UFC. However, his actions on Saturday night will make it difficult for him to earn another opportunity in the promotion. This incident tarnishes his reputation and raises questions about his character and professionalism.

For Lima, who remained undefeated at 8-0 after the fight, it was a disappointing turn of events. Despite being bitten, he remained remarkably calm and composed. He promptly informed the referee about the incident, which led to a brief investigation.

UFC CEO Dana White wasted no time in making a decision regarding Severino's future with the organization. White announced that Severino would be cut from the UFC roster. In an interview with KevinIole.com, White expressed his disappointment in Severino's actions and emphasized the consequences he would face. Not only did Severino lose the biggest opportunity of his life, but he would also encounter problems with the Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC).

Biting has occurred in combat sports before, and each instance is equally deplorable. It is a clear violation of the rules and a blatant disregard for fair play. Such behavior has no place in any sport, especially one as physically demanding and respected as mixed martial arts.

Severino's loss to Lima was his first defeat in his professional career. He now holds a record of 9-1, with the disqualification tarnishing an otherwise promising start to his UFC journey. In order to rebuild his reputation and work his way back to a reputable promotion like the UFC or the Professional Fighters League, Severino will need to prove himself in smaller promotions and demonstrate a change in his conduct.

As the UFC Fight Night event in Las Vegas wraps up, we await the results of the remaining fights. The incident between Severino and Lima serves as a reminder of the importance of sportsmanship and the consequences that come with unsportsmanlike behavior. It is crucial for athletes to respect the rules and their opponents, regardless of the pressure and intensity of the competition.

In conclusion, the biting incident involving Igor Severino and Andre Lima at UFC Fight Night: Ribas vs. Namajunas was a shocking display of unsportsmanlike conduct. Severino's disqualification and subsequent release from the UFC reflect the severity of his actions. It is essential for athletes to uphold the values of fair play and respect in combat sports.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff92c285143669667fa59c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3188,1794,x0,y217,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-23 22:45:24,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/23/explained-the-difference-between-a-solar-eclipse-and-a-lunar-eclipse/,Explained: The Difference Between A Solar Eclipse And A Lunar Eclipse,"Do you understand the distinction between a solar eclipse and a lunar eclipse? Two upcoming eclipses—a lunar eclipse on March 25 and a solar eclipse on April 8—offer a unique opportunity to witness these celestial events. While they may seem different, both are the result of a precise alignment of celestial bodies.

During a lunar eclipse, Earth's shadow falls on the moon, creating a striking visual phenomenon. Conversely, a solar eclipse occurs when the moon obstructs the sun's light, casting a shadow on Earth. These occurrences are infrequent due to the slight variance in the orbital planes of Earth and the moon.

A lunar eclipse occurs only during a full moon when Earth positions itself between the sun and the moon, casting a shadow into space. This rare alignment results in the moon passing through Earth's shadow, producing a lunar eclipse. On the other hand, a solar eclipse can only happen during a new moon when the moon comes between the sun and Earth, causing a shadow on our planet.

The mechanics behind a total lunar eclipse involve a precise alignment of the sun, Earth, and moon. Earth's two shadows—its outer penumbral shadow and inner umbral shadow—play a role in this phenomenon. When the moon enters Earth's umbra during a lunar eclipse, it reflects a reddish tint due to sunlight refracted by our atmosphere, creating a captivating ""Blood Moon"" effect.

In contrast, a total solar eclipse occurs when the sun, moon, and Earth align perfectly. The moon's umbra is projected onto Earth, resulting in a shadow moving across the planet's surface. This rare event offers a glimpse of the sun's corona, making it a spectacular sight for observers within the path of totality.

Eclipses, whether lunar or solar, are uncommon due to the moon's tilted orbit around Earth. This tilt causes the moon's path to intersect the sun's trajectory twice each month, leading to eclipse seasons where solar and lunar eclipses occur. However, these events are typically partial or annular, making total eclipses a rare occurrence.

Looking ahead, 2024 and 2025 will bring multiple opportunities to witness lunar and solar eclipses. Mark your calendars for the upcoming ""eclipse seasons"" and prepare to witness these awe-inspiring celestial events unfold in the skies above.

As we anticipate the upcoming total solar eclipse on April 8, stay tuned for more updates and insights on this celestial spectacle. May clear skies and wide eyes accompany you as you witness the wonders of the universe.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65f6b43702078076f68d7fcf/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-23 19:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/24/debunked-i-think-ive-seen-a-total-solar-eclipse-before/,Debunked: ‘I Think I’ve Seen A Total Solar Eclipse Before’,"Total Solar Eclipses in North America: A Rare and Unforgettable Experience

Have you ever thought you saw a total solar eclipse? Chances are, you were actually witnessing a partial solar eclipse. The distinction is crucial, as experiencing totality is a once-in-a-lifetime event that leaves a lasting impact.

Imagine being in the path of totality, where the moon completely blocks the sun, creating a surreal and awe-inspiring moment. The recent ""Great American Eclipse"" in 2017 brought this phenomenon to 12 U.S. states, captivating millions with its breathtaking display of the sun's corona.

If you're unsure about whether you've truly seen a total solar eclipse, there are ways to verify your experience. By checking the Solar Eclipses Visibility Database and examining interactive maps of past eclipses, you can determine if you were within the path of totality.

Looking ahead to April 8, 2024, another total solar eclipse is set to grace North America. This time, a staggering 42 million people, including 32 million Americans, will have the opportunity to witness this celestial spectacle. The path of totality will traverse through parts of Mexico, the United States, and Canada, offering a rare chance to experience totality.

As the date approaches, stay updated on the latest eclipse information, travel options, and accommodations to make the most of this extraordinary event. Clear skies and wide eyes await those who embark on this unforgettable journey.

Are you ready to witness the magic of a total solar eclipse? Mark your calendars for April 8, 2024, and prepare to be amazed by the wonders of the universe.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fd4263183a8b781f7df599/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2000,1125,x0,y223,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 07:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2024/03/24/epa-didnt-ban-gas-cars-it-cut-air-pollution-so-we-can-breathe-easier/,EPA Didn’t Ban Gas Cars. It Cut Air Pollution So We Can Breathe Easier.,"On days with high pollution levels, the air tastes metallic and leaves a sting in your nose and lungs, prompting people to stay indoors, especially vulnerable populations like the elderly, children, and those with respiratory conditions. The leading cause of toxic air pollution in most places? Internal combustion engines burning gas or diesel, spewing dirty emissions into the air we breathe. With over two-thirds of Americans relying on personal vehicles for daily travel, transportation has become the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, with light-duty vehicles alone responsible for nearly 60% of the pollution in this sector.

To combat this pervasive air pollution issue, we need to focus on reducing tailpipe emissions from vehicles. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently took a significant step by implementing new multi-pollutant rules for light-duty and smaller medium-duty vehicles to limit tailpipe pollution. These updated standards push automakers to adopt cleaner technologies, ensuring that new vehicles are cleaner than ever before.

Everyone deserves the option to choose a clean car for their next vehicle. Americans who are passionate about reducing pollution should have the opportunity to drive electric vehicles. Air pollution affects 36% of the U.S. population, with over 120 million people experiencing its harmful effects. Living in areas with unhealthy air quality can lead to respiratory issues like asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema, particularly impacting people of color and lower-income individuals.

While many celebrate the EPA's efforts to clean up our air, corporate entities that profit from selling polluting vehicles and petroleum see these standards as a threat to their interests. They claim that these regulations limit consumer choice and infringe on American freedoms. However, the reality is that these updated standards are long overdue and will benefit all Americans by improving air quality and providing consumers with cleaner transportation options.

Some profit-driven corporations have launched disinformation campaigns to mislead the public into believing that the EPA's standards will ban gas-powered vehicles. This is simply untrue. The EPA's standards are technology-neutral, performance-based, and grounded in scientific research. The Clean Air Act, enacted in 1970, empowers the EPA to establish air quality standards to protect public health and regulate emissions from vehicles and engines.

Before the Clean Air Act, cities like New York and Los Angeles suffered from severe air pollution, with conditions comparable to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day. The implementation of emissions standards led to the development of new technologies like catalytic converters and the switch to unleaded fuel, significantly improving air quality in urban areas. The EPA's commitment to regulating emissions from vehicles has played a crucial role in reducing pollution levels and safeguarding public health.

In conclusion, the EPA's efforts to limit tailpipe emissions from vehicles are essential for protecting our health and the environment. By embracing cleaner technologies and reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, we can create a cleaner, healthier future for all. It's time to prioritize clean air and sustainable transportation options for the well-being of current and future generations.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fe401fc35aefb76700b52e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 07:45:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/anuradhavaranasi/2024/03/24/which-adhd-medications-could-lower-risk-of-suicide--hospitalization/,Which ADHD Medications Could Lower Risk Of Suicide & Hospitalization?,"The ADHD process involves abnormalities in the cerebral areas responsible for attention, organizational skills, and emotional responses. A recent study of 221,714 individuals with ADHD revealed that those prescribed ADHD stimulant medications had a lower risk of suicide attempts and psychiatric hospitalizations. Specifically, medications like amphetamine, lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate were associated with decreased psychiatric hospitalizations. On the other hand, lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate were linked to a reduced risk of suicidal behavior.

The study also highlighted the prevalence of psychiatric co-morbidity among individuals with ADHD, which significantly increases the risk of mortality, especially in cases of substance use disorder. While atomoxetine did not lower the risk of psychiatric hospitalizations or suicidal behavior, it was associated with fewer hospitalizations for non-psychiatric co-morbidities.

The researchers emphasized the overall beneficial effects of ADHD medications on psychiatric outcomes, including decreased risk of depression and suicide. However, concerns regarding potential adverse effects such as increased blood pressure, heart rate, cardiovascular diseases, seizures, and psychosis were acknowledged.

The study, published in JAMA Network Open on March 20, 2024, analyzed data from a nationwide cohort of adolescents and adults with ADHD in Sweden. The findings underscored the importance of individualized medication approaches based on age and gender, with lisdexamphetamine showing efficacy across different age groups and methylphenidate potentially being less effective in older adults. Additionally, atomoxetine demonstrated a decreased risk of hospitalization among women but not men.

Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the association between specific ADHD medications and psychiatric outcomes, highlighting the need for further research on the long-term effectiveness and safety of ADHD pharmacotherapies.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/63c28dbb82c31b7412c92cf2/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 04:09:46,Innovation,Innovation
