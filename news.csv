https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-favorite-linux-text-editors-and-why-you-should-be-using-one/,My favorite Linux text editors (and why you should be using one),"Linux has a long history of text editors, with infamous editor wars between emacs and vi that divided users into loyal camps. However, the role of text editors has evolved over time. While they were initially used for configuring Linux and writing code, they now have a much broader range of applications. Text editors can be used for note-taking, journaling, and even writing novels. Personally, I have used text editors for writing short stories and flash fiction, although I have never attempted a full-length book.

In this list, I will not include vi or Emacs, despite their exceptional power. While these editors have their merits, I find that they often hinder rather than help. They are not designed for everyday use or for the average user, which is the focus of this article. However, if you find the editors listed here too simple or not flexible enough, you can always turn to vi or Emacs for coding, configuring, and administering tasks.

Now, let's dive into the text editors that are easier to use but still effective.

1. Nano
Nano has been my go-to text editor for decades. It may be basic, but it gets the job done. Nano includes all the essential features I need in an editor without overwhelming me with unnecessary extras. With Nano, you can write simple flat text files without any formatting. It offers interactive search-and-replace, undo/redo, syntax coloring, smooth scrolling, auto-indentation, go-to-line-and-column-number, feature toggles, file locking, and internationalization support.

It's important to note that Nano is a terminal application, which means it doesn't have a GUI app. To use Nano, you open the terminal and issue the command ""nano filename"" (replace ""filename"" with the name of the file you want to edit or create). There are several options you can use, such as ""--backup"" to create a backup of the previous version of the file, ""--tabstospaces"" to convert typed tabs to spaces, ""--locking"" to lock the file when editing, ""--smooth"" for smooth scrolling, and many more. Nano is free and comes pre-installed with most Linux distributions.

2. Gedit
Gedit is the default text editor for the GNOME desktop environment. It is a basic but effective GUI application. Gedit offers features like tabs, support for internationalized text (UTF-8), syntax highlighting, markdown support, configurable fonts and colors, print support, auto-save, auto backup, keyboard shortcuts, theming, full-screen mode, and more.

What sells me on Gedit is its simplicity. While I usually default to Nano, when I need a GUI, Gedit is my choice. One of the main reasons I keep Gedit around is that Nano has to be opened from the terminal window, which doesn't work as planned when clicking on a link to a text file. Gedit solves this problem. Additionally, Gedit can be used in fullscreen mode, allowing for distraction-free editing. Gedit is free and ships with most GNOME-based desktop distributions.

3. COSMIC Text Editor
COSMIC Text Editor will be the default text editor for System76's COSMIC desktop once it's released. However, the COSMIC Text Editor is already showing great progress and promises to be the Gedit equivalent for COSMIC. It will include features like syntax highlighting, standard keyboard shortcuts, find, spellcheck, project support, revert changes, document statistics, and even Git management support.

It's worth noting that I rarely find a dark theme preferable, but with COSMIC Text Editor, it just feels right. Like Gedit, COSMIC Text Editor is simple to use and can handle basic as well as more complicated tasks like writing code. If you use Pop!_OS, you can get a taste of what COSMIC Text Editor will look and feel like by installing it from the Pop Shop. COSMIC Text Editor is free and will be officially available when the COSMIC Desktop OS ships.

4. Kate
Kate is to the KDE Plasma desktop environment what Gedit is to GNOME. The main difference between the two is that Kate offers a few more features. For example, it has multi-cursor and multi-cursor selection, allowing you to select and manipulate multiple strings of text simultaneously. Kate also features project support, syntax highlighting, standard keyboard shortcuts, and plugins. With plugins, you can add features like SQL query support, GDB debugging, one-click project build, and more. Think of Kate as a supercharged version of Gedit that can also handle creating and editing simple text files.

With these text editors, you have a range of options to suit your needs. Whether you prefer the simplicity of Nano or the more feature-rich Gedit, there is a text editor for everyone. COSMIC Text Editor and Kate offer additional features and customization options, making them suitable for more advanced tasks. Give them a try and see which one works best for you.

In conclusion, the landscape of text editors on Linux has changed dramatically over the years. They are no longer limited to configuring Linux or writing code. Nowadays, text editors can be used for various purposes like note-taking, journaling, and even writing novels. With the editors listed here, you can find a suitable tool that strikes the right balance between simplicity and functionality. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced user, these text editors will help you get the job done efficiently.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/feda4ca65eefc13df0e3505780d84330ecd3c713/2024/03/25/d964a97e-9c56-444a-9497-19bc7ca26a56/typingclosegettyimages-1341060766.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25,Innovation,Innovation
