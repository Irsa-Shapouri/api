https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-vulnerability-virtual-reality.html,Vulnerability in virtual reality systems identified,"Virtual reality (VR) systems have opened up a whole new world of possibilities for users, allowing them to immerse themselves in virtual environments and interact with a variety of experiences. However, a team of computer scientists from the University of Chicago has recently discovered a potential vulnerability in VR systems that could pose a serious security risk.

In a paper published on the arXiv preprint server, the researchers describe their findings regarding what they call ""inception attacks."" These attacks involve the insertion of an ""inception layer"" between a user's VR Home Screen and their VR User/Server, essentially tricking the user into interacting with a simulated VR app created by the attacker.

The concept behind this type of attack is to create a layer of reality that is different from what the user would typically perceive when using their VR device. The researchers drew inspiration from the movie ""Inception,"" in which a character played by Leonardo DiCaprio has an altered layer of reality implanted in his mind.

By adding this inception layer, hackers could potentially record sensitive information, such as passcodes entered into virtual ATMs, or intercept and manipulate data related to financial transactions. They could even introduce virtual characters representing friends or family members to gain the user's trust and access confidential information. In essence, these attacks could monitor or alter the user's gestures, voice commands, browsing activity, and social or business interactions within the VR environment.

To test the effectiveness of this type of attack, the research team enlisted the help of 28 volunteers who played a game using a demonstration VR headset. They then downloaded an app onto the devices, simulating a hacking scenario. Surprisingly, only 10 of the volunteers noticed a slight flickering during the download and activation process, and only one of them expressed concerns about potential malicious activity.

Upon discovering these vulnerabilities, the researchers promptly informed Meta, the company behind the Meta Quest VR system used in the experiment. Meta has responded by stating that they will investigate the issue and take appropriate measures to address any confirmed vulnerabilities. The researchers also caution that similar vulnerabilities may exist in other VR systems and apps that attempt to insert themselves between users and their VR devices.

The potential implications of these inception attacks are undoubtedly concerning. As VR technology continues to evolve and become more integrated into our daily lives, ensuring the security and privacy of users should be a top priority. By shedding light on this vulnerability, the research team hopes to raise awareness and encourage further efforts to develop robust security measures for VR systems.

In conclusion, while VR technology offers incredible opportunities for immersive experiences, it is essential to remain vigilant and proactive in identifying and addressing potential security risks. By staying informed and taking appropriate precautions, we can continue to enjoy the benefits of VR while minimizing the chances of falling victim to malicious attacks.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/vulnerability-in-virtu.jpg,2024-03-25 10:20:02,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/boeing-ceo-to-leave-company-by-year-end-after-a-wave-of-safety-incidents/,Boeing CEO to leave company by year-end after a wave of safety incidents,"Boeing's CEO, Dave Calhoun, is set to step down from his position by the end of this year, as announced by the company. This decision comes in the wake of a series of safety incidents that have plagued the aircraft manufacturer.

Among the incidents that have tarnished Boeing's reputation is a cabin panel blowout on one of its planes, along with several other serious safety issues. These incidents have raised concerns about the company's commitment to ensuring passenger safety.

Boeing has been actively engaged in fostering innovation through its Aerospace Xelerated program, previously known as the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI). This program aims to collaborate with startups in the aerospace industry. However, it remains unclear how Calhoun's departure will impact this initiative. TechCrunch has reached out to Aerospace Xelerated for a comment on this matter.

In a statement, Calhoun expressed his intention to focus on stabilizing and positioning the company for the future in the months ahead. This suggests that Boeing is aware of the need to address the challenges it currently faces and hopes to regain trust in its products.

One incident that has significantly impacted Boeing's reputation occurred in January when an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 jet was forced into an emergency landing. This incident led to the grounding of 171 Max 9 jets for several weeks. It was the most significant safety crisis for Boeing since the tragic crashes of two Max 8 jets in 2018 and 2019, which claimed the lives of 346 individuals.

In addition to Calhoun's departure, Stan Deal, the head of Boeing's commercial airplanes business (BCA), will also be leaving the company. Stephanie Pope will take over the leadership of BCA. Pope has been serving as the chief operating officer of Boeing since January of this year. Previously, she held the position of president and CEO of Boeing Global Services, where she played a crucial role in overseeing the company's aerospace services for various customers worldwide.

This is an ongoing story, and further updates will be provided as more information becomes available. Boeing's leadership change marks a significant moment for the company as it seeks to address its safety concerns and rebuild trust with its stakeholders. It remains to be seen how the new leadership will navigate the challenges ahead and steer Boeing towards a more secure and successful future.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1910140688.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-25 12:48:28,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobinglis/2024/03/25/avoiding-the-judgment-of-history/,Avoiding The Judgment Of History,"Art Laffer, the former economics advisor to President Ronald Reagan, recently met with former President Trump to discuss the possibility of replacing Jerome Powell as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Laffer has been supportive of a revenue-neutral carbon tax as an effective market-based solution to solving climate change.

In a recent statement, Kim Beazley, Australia's former ambassador to the US, emphasized the importance of taking a stance on climate change. Beazley wants his children and grandchildren to know where he stands on the issue, as well as the positions of others. This sentiment reflects the growing concern and urgency surrounding climate change.

However, the U.S. House of Representatives recently passed a non-binding resolution condemning a carbon tax. This resolution was introduced by Rep. Ryan Zinke and had previously been offered by Rep. Steve Scalise. It is disheartening to see lawmakers dismiss the potential of carbon pricing, which is widely recognized as one of the most effective means of addressing climate change.

It is important to address the misconceptions surrounding a well-designed carbon tax. Firstly, it can be made revenue-neutral by offsetting it with a reduction in an existing tax. This means that there is no growth of government, and the burden is not placed solely on taxpayers. Secondly, a carbon tax can be made border-adjustable, meaning it can be applied to imports from countries that have yet to implement similar measures. This ensures fairness and encourages other nations to take action.

Interestingly, during the same week that the carbon tax resolution was passed, Art Laffer was reported to have met with Donald Trump regarding the possibility of replacing Jerome Powell as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Laffer, along with Kevin Hassett, has advocated for solving climate change through a carbon tax paired with a reduction in existing taxes.

Both Laffer and Hassett draw inspiration from Arthur Cecil Pigou, an English economist known for advocating for taxing harmful activities and untaxing beneficial ones. They are members of the Pigou Club, founded by Harvard economist Greg Mankiw, who served as Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush.

The concept behind Pigou's theory is simple yet powerful. Taxing activities that contribute to pollution, such as carbon emissions, while reducing taxes on income can incentivize cleaner practices and discourage harmful ones. This approach addresses concerns about the regressive nature of a carbon tax, as taxes on payroll income can be reduced. Moreover, it strengthens programs like Social Security by broadening their tax base.

Another aspect that the drafters of the carbon tax resolution seem to overlook is the possibility of applying the tax to imports from countries without a carbon tax. This can be done under existing World Trade Organization rules and is known as a border adjustment. By implementing such measures, other countries would be motivated to follow suit, as they would not want to lose carbon tax revenue to the United States. This domino effect would lead to a global understanding of the true cost of burning fossil fuels and incentivize the production of greener, cleaner products.

Pigou would be proud of these efforts. He recognized that negative externalities, such as the costs imposed on society by polluting activities, create market distortions that hinder innovation. By taxing these externalities, we can level the playing field and encourage the development of cleaner technologies. This aligns with the views of Dr. Milton Friedman, one of President Reagan's economic advisors, who suggested taxing polluters in a clip from the Phil Donahue Show in the 1980s.

It is crucial to remember that history judges us all, regardless of our political affiliations. Democrats and Republicans alike must prioritize policy over politics when it comes to addressing climate change. While the carbon tax resolution was non-binding, it is not too late to correct this mistake and strive for redemption. We must seize the opportunity to implement effective solutions and ensure a sustainable future for generations to come.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6601d28de733bba2fcac676c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 15:47:48,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-large-language-simple-mechanism-knowledge.html,Large language models use a surprisingly simple mechanism to retrieve some stored knowledge,"Large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools that are used in various applications, but scientists are still trying to understand how they work. Researchers at MIT and other institutions have delved into the mechanisms behind these models to gain insights into their knowledge retrieval process.

Surprisingly, the researchers discovered that LLMs often employ a simple linear function to retrieve and decode stored facts. Linear functions, which involve only two variables and no exponents, capture a straightforward relationship between these variables. They found that the model uses the same decoding function for similar types of facts.

By identifying these linear functions for different facts, the researchers were able to probe the model and determine where it stores its knowledge about new subjects. Even when the model provides incorrect answers, it often retains the correct information. This finding opens up possibilities for using this approach to identify and correct falsehoods within the model, reducing instances of incorrect or nonsensical responses.

According to Evan Hernandez, an electrical engineering and computer science graduate student at MIT and co-lead author of the research paper, large language models are complex and difficult to understand. However, there are simple mechanisms at work within them, as demonstrated by this study.

The research team, which includes Arnab Sharma, a computer science graduate student at Northeastern University, and their advisors Jacob Andreas and David Bau, developed a technique to estimate these simple functions. They applied this method to compute functions for 47 different relations, such as ""capital city of a country"" and ""lead singer of a band."" These relations were chosen as representative examples of the types of facts that can be retrieved using linear functions.

Through their experiments, the researchers found that LLMs decode relational information using specific linear functions that are tailored to the type of fact being retrieved. For instance, one decoding function is used to output the instrument a person plays, while another function is used to output the state where a person was born.

Understanding these mechanisms is crucial in deciphering how LLMs access and utilize their stored knowledge. By comprehending the underlying processes, researchers can gain insights into the decision-making and information retrieval capabilities of these models. This knowledge may further contribute to improving the accuracy and reliability of large language models.

The findings of this research will be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024) in May. The study sheds light on the internal workings of LLMs and uncovers the simplicity underlying their complex operations. Further exploration of these mechanisms could lead to advancements in the field of artificial intelligence and the development of more efficient and accurate language models.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/large-language-models-2.jpg,2024-03-25 09:34:06,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/25/in-photos-worm-moon-lunar-eclipse-sets-up-total-solar-eclipse/,In Photos: ‘Worm Moon Lunar Eclipse’ Sets Up Total Solar Eclipse,"March’s full moon, known as the ""Worm Moon,"" made its appearance on Sunday night. It was accompanied by a partial lunar eclipse that lasted nearly five hours into Monday in certain parts of the world. This lunar event sets the stage for a total solar eclipse in North America during the next new moon on Monday, April 8.

The third full moon of 2024, also marking the beginning of spring in the northern hemisphere, was visible across the globe. However, the partial lunar eclipse could only be seen from the night side of the planet at the right time, which included North and South America, Europe, East Asia, Australia, and New Zealand.

From the perspective of the moon, Earth partially blocked the sun, resulting in the eclipse. As the sun set in New York City on March 24, the full Worm Moon rose behind the skyline of midtown Manhattan and the Empire State Building, creating a stunning visual spectacle.

Now, let's take a look at some of the most striking images captured during this full moon and partial lunar eclipse from different parts of the world.

A lunar eclipse occurs exclusively during a full moon when the moon enters Earth's shadow. This can only happen when the moon is on the opposite side of the Earth from the sun. One such eclipse occurred on Monday morning, known as a penumbral lunar eclipse. In space, Earth has two shadows—the dark umbra and the lighter penumbra. During this particular eclipse, the moon only entered the penumbra, and its journey through it lasted precisely 4 hours and 39 minutes. 

As the moon traversed the penumbra, the edge of Earth's massive shadow moved gradually across the lunar surface, diminishing the intensity of sunlight hitting the moon. This is distinct from a ""Blood Moon"" where the moon passes through the umbra, and the only sunlight that reaches the lunar surface is refracted by Earth's atmosphere, giving it a reddish hue.

During the penumbral lunar eclipse, the moon shared the sky with the stars of the constellation Virgo. Spica, the brightest star in Virgo, appeared to the lower left of the moon, while Antares, the brightest star in Scorpius, shone high to its upper right. Over the next two nights, the moon will appear even closer to Spica, creating a captivating celestial sight.

The Worm Moon, like all full moons, was visible throughout the night, rising in the east at sunset and setting in the west at sunrise. It earned its name because spring marks the emergence of beetle larvae from the thawing bark of trees, according to the Almanac.

The next new moon, set to occur on April 8, will be a ""supermoon"" and will appear larger than usual as it moves across the sun, causing a partial solar eclipse visible in North America. The total solar eclipse on April 8 will last for up to 4 minutes and 26 seconds, but it will only be visible within a 115-mile wide path of totality.

This path will stretch from the Pacific coast of northwestern Mexico to Atlantic Canada, passing through 15 U.S. states including Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. Those outside this path will witness only a partial solar eclipse.

It is worth noting that a total solar eclipse occurs, on average, only once every 366 years. However, North America is fortunate enough to experience two total solar eclipses within a span of just seven years, with the last one occurring on August 21, 2017.

Following the ""Worm Moon"" and the total solar eclipse, the next full moon will be the ""Pink Moon,"" scheduled to appear at 23:48 UTC/7:48 p.m. EDT on Tuesday, April 23. This will be the fourth full moon of 2024.

We hope you enjoyed witnessing the beauty of the ""Worm Moon"" and the partial lunar eclipse. May your eyes always be filled with wonder and the skies remain clear for your celestial observations.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6601aa9bc397763ceaf0c79a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1566,881,x217,y217,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 12:57:41,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/lucid-motors-1-billion-saudi-arabia-gravity-suv/,Lucid Motors raises another $1 billion from Saudi Arabia as it searches for luxury EV buyers,"Lucid Motors, the luxury electric vehicle manufacturer, is securing an additional $1 billion in funding from its major investor, Saudi Arabia. The investment will help offset the high costs associated with producing and selling its high-end electric sedan.

In a regulatory filing on Monday morning, Lucid revealed that Ayar Third Investment, an affiliate of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, has agreed to purchase $1 billion worth of Lucid's stock. This will increase the Kingdom's stake in the company to approximately 60%.

This new funding comes shortly after Lucid announced its plans to produce around 9,000 units of its Air electric vehicles this year, slightly higher than last year's production. Despite generating a loss of $2.8 billion in 2023, Lucid ended the year with nearly $1.4 billion in cash and equivalents.

Lucid has faced challenges in finding buyers for its expensive Air sedan and has resorted to reducing prices multiple times in recent months to stimulate sales. Additionally, the company intends to commence production of its electric Gravity SUV by the end of this year.

Interestingly, Lucid's decision to accept further investment from Saudi Arabia comes just weeks after CEO Peter Rawlinson expressed caution about relying too heavily on the Kingdom for financial support. Rawlinson emphasized the importance of not assuming unlimited funding from the Public Investment Fund (PIF), stating that he has great respect for the organization.

The partnership between Lucid Motors and Saudi Arabia has been instrumental in the company's growth. However, Rawlinson's remarks indicate a desire to diversify funding sources and reduce dependence on a single investor. This latest investment from Saudi Arabia highlights the Kingdom's continued confidence in Lucid's potential and aligns with its commitment to promoting sustainable transportation solutions.

With the additional funding, Lucid can address the financial challenges associated with developing and marketing its luxury electric vehicles. The company's decision to expand its production capabilities reflects its determination to meet the growing demand for electric vehicles and establish itself as a prominent player in the industry.

Lucid's Air sedan has garnered attention for its cutting-edge technology, impressive performance, and luxurious features. However, the high price point has limited its appeal to a niche market. By strategically lowering prices and introducing new models like the Gravity SUV, Lucid aims to appeal to a wider range of consumers and drive sales growth.

The collaboration between Lucid and Saudi Arabia represents a significant step towards achieving the shared goal of transitioning to sustainable transportation. Lucid's expertise in electric vehicle technology, combined with the Kingdom's financial support, can accelerate the development and adoption of environmentally friendly transportation alternatives.

In conclusion, Lucid Motors' latest funding round from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund demonstrates the Kingdom's commitment to supporting the growth of the electric vehicle industry. With this additional capital, Lucid can address financial challenges, expand production capabilities, and enhance its position in the market. The partnership between Lucid and Saudi Arabia exemplifies the collective effort to drive sustainable transportation solutions and marks an important milestone in the global shift towards electric vehicles.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2580.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-25 14:31:52,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.forbes.com/sites/webroot/2024/03/25/7-cyber-safety-tips-to-outsmart-scammers/,7 Cyber Safety Tips To Outsmart Scammers,"Welcome to the wild west of the digital world, where cyber scammers are lurking around every pixelated corner. Cybercrime is not just a futuristic Hollywood plotline; it is a real threat that targets everyone, from wide-eyed kids to seasoned adults and wise grandparents. And guess what? It is on the rise faster than your Wi-Fi connection during peak hours. So, buckle up as we sail through the seven seas of cyber safety.

Before we dive headfirst into the world of cyber safety tips, let's arm ourselves with the ultimate weapon: knowledge. Scams are the digital version of snake oil salespeople peddling miracle cures. They come in all shapes and sizes, lurking in the shadowy corners of the internet. The golden rule of scam detection is skepticism. Whether it's a promise of untold riches, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, or a free Caribbean cruise courtesy of a Nigerian prince, approach with caution and a healthy dose of skepticism.

Now, let's take a quick tour through the realm of common cyber scams:

1. Phishing scams: Ah, phishing scams, the bane of our digital existence. These sneaky scams involve fake emails posing as messages from familiar faces or reputable companies. They try to sweet-talk you into clicking on suspicious links or divulging sensitive information like passwords or credit card details. Remember: real companies don't ask for your personal data via email.

2. Sweepstakes and awards scams: Congratulations! You've just won a brand new car, a tropical vacation, and a lifetime supply of unicorn-shaped cookies. All you need to do is pay a small processing fee. Sound too good to be true? That's because it is! These scams offer you instant wealth but are really just clever ruses to empty your wallet faster than you can say ""jackpot.""

3. Investment scams: Picture this: a golden opportunity to double your money with zero risk. Investment scams lure unsuspecting victims with the promise of sky-high profits. Don't let these offers cloud your judgment. Always do your due diligence before investing your hard-earned cash.

4. Lawsuit or tax scams: Lawsuit and tax scams thrive on instilling fear and panic, claiming you owe urgent payments. When in doubt, verify the legitimacy of any claims before reaching for your wallet.

5. Romance scams: Romance scams prey on the trusting hearts of hopeful romantics, weaving elaborate tales of love and devotion before swooping in for the financial kill. Remember: anyone who asks for money online is more likely to break your heart than mend it.

6. Tech support scams: These imposters offer remote assistance to fix nonexistent problems with your laptop or devices while gaining access to your sensitive data. Remember: legitimate tech support doesn't come knocking unsolicited. If in doubt, just delete the email and seek help from trusted sources.

Armed with this knowledge, you are ready to navigate the digital minefield with confidence. You can also be a good internet citizen by forwarding these scams to the U.S. government's Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) at phishing-report@us-cert.gov.

Now, let's dive into the seven tips to stay safe online:

1. Use strong passwords: Let's start with the basics. Your password is the digital key to your castle, so make sure it's not something as flimsy as '123456' or 'password.' Get creative! Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters like a mad scientist concocting a secret potion. And don't reuse passwords across multiple accounts unless you want to throw a welcome party for cybercriminals.

2. Enable two-factor authentication: Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts. It requires you to provide a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password. This way, even if someone manages to crack your password, they won't be able to access your account without the second factor.

3. Keep your software up to date: Software updates often include important security patches that fix vulnerabilities. By keeping your operating system, web browser, and other software up to date, you ensure that you have the latest defenses against cyber threats.

4. Be cautious of suspicious links and attachments: Think before you click! Avoid clicking on links or opening attachments in emails or messages from unknown sources. They may contain malware or lead you to phishing websites designed to steal your personal information. When in doubt, verify the legitimacy of the sender before taking any action.

5. Use a reputable antivirus software: An antivirus software acts as a shield against malware and other cyber threats. Choose a reputable antivirus program and keep it updated to detect and remove any malicious software that may try to sneak onto your devices.

6. Secure your home network: Your home network is the gateway to your digital world. Protect it by changing the default password on your router, enabling network encryption, and regularly updating your router's firmware. Also, consider using a strong, unique password for your Wi-Fi network to prevent unauthorized access.

7. Educate yourself and your loved ones: Knowledge is power when it comes to staying safe online. Stay informed about the latest scams and cybersecurity best practices. Share this knowledge with your family and friends, especially children and older adults who may be more vulnerable to online threats.

By following these tips, you can navigate the digital landscape with confidence and protect yourself from cybercriminals. Remember, the wild west of the digital world may be treacherous, but with the right precautions, you can ride off into the sunset unscathed. Stay safe out there!",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ea0ea426a7cb96ff0f5cde/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 11:48:40,Innovation,Innovation

Laura Jones, Chief Marketing Officer at Instacart, and Spencer Rascoff, co-founder of Zillow, will be joining the board with immediate effect.

According to Match, these appointments are the result of a ""constructive dialogue"" with Elliott Management, as the two companies have entered into an ""information-sharing"" agreement. This news comes a few months after Elliott Management reportedly acquired a stake of around $1 billion in Match Group. The Wall Street Journal reported that Elliott was interested in discussing strategies to improve Match's performance, as the company has seen a decline in paying users amidst economic uncertainty.

""We are one of the largest investors of Match Group today because we believe in its opportunity for significant value creation as the global leader in online dating,"" said Marc Steinberg, partner at Elliott, in a press release. ""We appreciate the collaboration with management and the Board over the past several months, and we are confident that Laura Jones and Spencer Rascoff are strong additions to the Board. We believe their unique skills and perspectives will help support the Company through its next phase of growth.""

Elliott Management has gained a reputation for acquiring stakes in tech companies and advocating for changes. The investor's push for change at Match follows similar board shakeups at Crown Castle and Etsy.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, Match Group experienced a 5% year-over-year decrease in total paid users, with a current total of 15.2 million. The company's growth has slowed from its peak during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a 79% decline in stock value since 2021.

Match Group is the parent company of various popular dating apps, including Tinder, Hinge, Match.com, Meetic, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, OurTime, and more.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1241790742.jpeg?w=1024,2024-03-25 14:15:04,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/london-regtech-gss-raises-47m-to-help-banks-screen-for-global-sanctions/,London regtech GSS raises $47M to help banks screen for global sanctions,"Global Screening Services (GSS), a London-based regulatory compliance platform, has successfully raised $47 million in funding. GSS specializes in assisting financial institutions in meeting their global sanctions obligations. This significant funding round comes at a time when economic sanctions are on the rise, with the United States imposing trade restrictions and asset blocking against countries such as Russia, China, and Iran.

GSS was founded by Tom Scampion, who previously served as the head of financial crime for Deloitte's EMEA arm. In 2020, Scampion became a general partner at consulting firm AlixPartner. It was during his time at AlixPartner that GSS was initially incubated before emerging as an independent entity in 2021. Last year, GSS secured a similar amount of funding from prominent investors, including Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). For its latest funding round, GSS has attracted support from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), Cynosure Group, and AlixPartner.

Financial institutions frequently find themselves at the forefront of sanctions enforcement due to their role in overseeing global financial transactions. However, identifying the parties involved in these transactions can be challenging. In 2019, Standard Chartered faced fines totaling $1.1 billion from regulators in the UK and the US for inadequate money laundering controls and breaching sanctions against countries like Iran. Similarly, in a separate case, BNP Paribas was fined a staggering $8.9 billion for processing financial transactions on behalf of US-sanctioned countries.

Given the increasing importance of regulatory compliance, investors have shown continued support for businesses operating in this field. Droit, a New York-based company, raised $23 million in funding last year, while London's SteelEye secured $21 million. GSS offers a sanctions-screening platform that helps banks and other financial institutions adhere to regulations. These institutions input transaction data into GSS's cloud-based platform, which then cross-references the data against a comprehensive set of sanctions lists from around the world. GSS also enhances these lists with additional data points, including dates of birth, International Maritime Organization (IMO) numbers, and data from the local financial transfer systems of sanctioned countries.

Furthermore, GSS offers ""enhanced"" lists for screening, which include companies that are partly owned by individuals, companies, or governments subject to sanctions by organizations such as OFAC, the EU, or the UK. With the recent funding infusion of $47 million, GSS is now transitioning from its development phase to becoming fully operational. The company is preparing to launch its services for its first set of customers.

In summary, Global Screening Services has secured $47 million in funding to support its efforts in assisting financial institutions with regulatory compliance regarding global sanctions. With a strong investor backing and a range of innovative solutions, GSS is well-positioned to make a significant impact in the industry.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1770041999-e1711386339681.jpg?resize=1200,677",2024-03-25 18:36:37,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-high-efficiency-based-copperiodide-clusters.html,A high efficiency LED based on copper-iodide clusters,"A team of researchers led by Prof. Yao Hongbin from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) has made a significant breakthrough in the development of light-emitting diodes (LEDs). They have created a high efficiency, high brightness warm white LED using copper-iodide cluster hybrids. This innovative LED technology has the potential to revolutionize the field of solid-state lighting.

Currently, solution-processed LEDs are considered to be the future of large-area solid-state lighting due to their simple manufacturing process and high operability. Various types of solution-processed LEDs, such as those based on lead-halide perovskites, organic semiconductor materials, and colloidal core-shell quantum dots (QDs), have already achieved impressive electroluminescence performance.

However, the use of materials containing heavy metals, like lead-halide perovskites and CdSe QDs, raises serious environmental concerns. On the other hand, LEDs based on organic light-emitting molecules, InP QDs, and ZnSe QDs have high production costs due to their complex synthesis. Therefore, the development of solution-processed LEDs that are low-cost, low-toxicity, easily scalable, and highly efficient is a crucial challenge for the future of solid-state lighting.

To address this challenge, Prof. Yao's team focused on designing and preparing a copper-iodine-based hybrid cluster with a broad photoluminescence spectrum. They introduced nitrogen-phosphine chelating ligands and phosphine-containing solubilizing ligands to obtain copper-iodide hybrid clusters with high luminescence efficiency and solubility. These clusters demonstrated excellent solubility of more than 200 mg/mL and structural stability in N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF), a cross-solvent used in LED production.

The team then fabricated luminescent thin films using spin-coating in DMF. These films exhibited a low surface roughness of 0.22 nm and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of over 70%. They served as a luminescent layer to create low-cost warm-white LED devices through an orthogonal solvent route.

The resulting LED devices achieved remarkable performance. They achieved a maximum external quantum efficiency of 19.1%, a brightness of over 40,000 cd m-2, and an operational lifetime of more than 232 hours (T 50 @100 cd m-2). Furthermore, thanks to the excellent solubility and processability of the clusters, the team successfully constructed a large-area solution-processed LED device with a working area of 36 cm2 using blade-coating. This device emitted warm white light with a brightness close to 60,000 cd m-2.

Additionally, by modifying different electron-donating groups on the nitrogen heterocycles of the nitrogen-phosphine chelating ligands, the team developed a series of solution-processed color-tunable LED devices.

This groundbreaking work by Prof. Yao's team has demonstrated the potential of copper-iodide hybrid clusters in creating LED devices with high efficiency and high brightness. The structural expandability and spectral tunability of these clusters make them highly promising for fabricating low-cost, high-performance LED panels and solid-state lighting.

In conclusion, the development of a high efficiency, high brightness warm white LED based on copper-iodide cluster hybrids represents a significant advancement in the field of solid-state lighting. The research conducted by Prof. Yao Hongbin and his team opens up new possibilities for the future of LED technology. Their solution-processed LED devices offer a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to existing technologies. With further advancements and optimizations, these LEDs could soon be widely adopted for various lighting applications, contributing to a more sustainable and energy-efficient future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/ustc-designs-high-effi.jpg,2024-03-25 13:17:52,Innovation,Innovation
