https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have experienced impressive growth in recent years, and they share several similarities. Both companies stumbled upon their core businesses by chance. AWS realized it could sell the internal services it had created for itself, while Nvidia discovered that its gaming GPU was also well suited for processing AI workloads. This led to significant revenue growth for both companies, with Nvidia's revenue soaring from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024 to $22.1 billion in Q4 2024, largely driven by its data center business.

Although AWS has consistently been a major revenue driver for Amazon, its growth has started to slow down. Meanwhile, Nvidia's growth is taking off. However, it's important to note that as the GPU market becomes more competitive, Nvidia may need to rely on its other, smaller revenue-generating businesses. These businesses are growing at a slower rate than the GPU data center business, which raises questions about whether Nvidia can maintain its growth and become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS.

In the short term, Nvidia's financial outlook is incredibly promising. The company expects to generate $24 billion in revenue in its current quarter, representing a 234% growth compared to the same period last year. While Nvidia's growth rate is expected to decline from its recent astronomical figures, it is still projected to continue scaling its revenue past the $100 billion annual run rate mark. Analysts predict that Nvidia will generate $110.5 billion in revenue in its current fiscal year, an 81% increase from the previous year.

AI is likely to be a significant driver of growth for Nvidia in the coming years, despite increased competition from AMD, Intel, and other chipmakers. IDC data shows that Nvidia has a firm grip on the chip market, and while AMD is gaining ground, Nvidia still dominates. However, competition is expected to intensify, and Nvidia may need to face stiffer challenges in the future. Nevertheless, Nvidia's current market share and momentum position the company well for continued success.

In conclusion, Nvidia and AWS have experienced remarkable growth due to their ability to adapt to changing market demands and capitalize on emerging technologies. While AWS has become a highly profitable business for Amazon, Nvidia's growth trajectory is equally impressive. The key question is whether Nvidia can sustain its growth and become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS. With its dominance in the GPU market and the continued expansion of AI, Nvidia has a promising future ahead. However, increased competition and potential market shifts may pose challenges in the long run. Nonetheless, Nvidia's current momentum and strong financial outlook make it a company to watch in the tech industry.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2024/03/25/apple-secretly-engineering-iphone-for-game-changing-update-to-apple-pay-report-claims/,"Apple Secretly Engineering iPhone For Game-Changing Update, Report Claims","One of the key aspects of the recent Department of Justice lawsuit against Apple involves the NFC chip in the iPhone. This chip powers Apple Pay and has been restricted from use by external firms due to security and privacy concerns. However, it appears that this may soon change as Apple is reportedly making preparations behind the scenes.

According to Mark Gurman of Bloomberg, the NFC chip situation has already been altered in the European Union and a similar change could be on the horizon for the United States. The NFC chip is what enables Apple Pay users to make quick and seamless payments by simply tapping their phone on a card reader. Apple has tightly controlled access to this chip, as any breach could potentially compromise users' finances. Apple Pay has always been regarded as a secure and trustworthy payment method.

It's worth noting that by keeping the NFC chip locked, Apple also protects the royalties it charges on each transaction. If third-party financial companies were allowed to use the chip, they could impose their own royalty fees, excluding Apple from the equation.

This issue is not new, as Gurman reported nearly two years ago. He highlighted that Apple's policy prevents companies like PayPal, Square, and major financial institutions from launching tap-to-pay iPhone apps with their own features and interfaces. These companies must also pay up to a 0.15% fee for every Apple Pay credit card transaction if they want to access the iPhone user base. Estimates suggest that Apple Pay generates over $1 billion per year in fees.

For reasons related to finance, safety, and security, it's clear why Apple is hesitant to open up access to the NFC chip. However, when the European Union introduced the Digital Markets Act earlier this year, Apple was required to offer access to the chip, despite its security concerns. Reluctantly, Apple complied.

Behind the scenes, it seems that Apple is preparing for potential changes in other regions as well. Gurman reports that engineering work to open up NFC access in the United States is already underway. While there is no specific timeline, if the transition goes smoothly in the EU, it's likely that this significant change could be implemented in the US in the near future.

In conclusion, the Department of Justice lawsuit has brought attention to Apple's control over the NFC chip in the iPhone and its reluctance to allow third-party access. However, recent developments suggest that Apple is quietly preparing for a potential shift in its policy. Opening up access to the NFC chip could have significant implications for Apple Pay and the financial industry as a whole. As the situation unfolds, it will be interesting to see how Apple navigates the balance between security, privacy, and competition.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6601869f70d828f8cfe50372/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3662,2060,x0,y591,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 10:15:49,Innovation,Innovation

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-household-robots-common.html,Engineering household robots to have a little common sense,"From wiping up spills to serving food, robots are becoming more capable of performing complex household tasks. Many of these robots are taught through imitation, where they mimic human motions guided by a human operator. However, robots often struggle to handle unexpected situations unless they are explicitly programmed for every possible scenario. To address this limitation, MIT engineers have developed a method that combines robot motion data with the ""common sense knowledge"" of large language models (LLMs) to give robots a sense of adaptability.

The researchers' approach allows robots to break down complex tasks into subtasks and adjust their actions in response to disruptions. This means that robots can continue with a task without starting from scratch or requiring engineers to program specific fixes for every failure. Yanwei Wang, a graduate student at MIT, explains that blindly mimicking human motion trajectories can lead to errors accumulating and derailing the execution. With their method, robots can self-correct errors and improve overall task success.

The MIT team will present their research at the International Conference on Learning Representations in May. The study's co-authors include Tsun-Hsuan Wang, Jiayuan Mao, Michael Hagenow, and Julie Shah. The researchers demonstrate their approach using a simple task of scooping marbles from one bowl and pouring them into another. Traditionally, engineers would guide the robot through the entire motion trajectory, but the MIT team realized that tasks consist of sequential subtasks. For example, before scooping, the robot needs to reach into the bowl, and before pouring, it needs to scoop the marbles.

When a robot makes a mistake during one of these subtasks, it usually has to start over unless engineers explicitly program it to recover from failures. However, this level of planning is time-consuming. The researchers found that language models can automate some of this planning. Language models process extensive text libraries to establish connections between words, sentences, and paragraphs. They can generate new sentences based on what they have learned. In this case, the researchers prompt the language model to produce a logical list of subtasks involved in a task. For instance, when asked about the actions involved in scooping marbles, the language model might respond with ""reach,"" ""scoop,"" ""transport,"" and ""pour.""

The researchers developed an algorithm to connect the language model's natural language labels for each subtask with the robot's physical position or an image that represents the robot's state. This process, known as ""grounding,"" allows the robot to automatically determine its progress in a task and adapt accordingly. The algorithm maps the robot's physical coordinates or state image to the language model's labels.

By combining robot motion data with language models, the MIT team has enabled robots to have a sense of common sense and adaptability. The robots can parse complex tasks into subtasks and adjust their actions based on disruptions, improving overall task success. This method reduces the need for explicit programming for every possible failure scenario, making robots more efficient and capable in household tasks.

The researchers' work has significant implications for the development of household robots. With their method, robots can learn and adapt to new situations more effectively, reducing the need for constant manual intervention. This approach opens up possibilities for robots to handle a wide range of household tasks with greater autonomy and reliability.

In conclusion, MIT engineers have developed a method that combines robot motion data with language models to give robots a sense of common sense and adaptability. By breaking down complex tasks into subtasks and allowing robots to adjust their actions based on disruptions, they can improve overall task success without relying on explicit programming for every possible failure scenario. This advancement brings us closer to a future where robots can perform a wide range of household tasks with greater autonomy and reliability.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/engineering-household.jpg,2024-03-25 09:48:20,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/fisker-nissan-deal-dead-funding-bankruptcy/,"Fisker loses potential Nissan deal, putting rescue funds at risk","The negotiations between Fisker and a large automaker, which is rumored to be Nissan, have come to an end. This development puts the company's near-term rescue funding effort in jeopardy.

Fisker made the announcement in a regulatory filing on Monday morning, stating that the automaker terminated the negotiations on March 22. The company did not provide a reason for this decision. However, it was obligated to continue the negotiations as part of the closing conditions for a potential $150 million convertible note that was announced last week. Fisker has stated that it will ask the unnamed investor to waive this closing condition.

As a result of this news, Fisker's stock plummeted by 28% after the stock market opened, leading to trading being halted.

This latest development adds to the growing list of challenges faced by the struggling electric vehicle (EV) startup. Fisker has been struggling to sell its Ocean SUV, falling short of its own internal sales goals. In response, the company has had to shift away from its original direct sales model. Furthermore, the vehicles that have been delivered have been plagued by numerous quality issues, which Fisker has had difficulty resolving, according to internal documents.

In February, Fisker was forced to lay off 15% of its staff, amounting to around 200 people. Last week, the company reported having only $121 million in its bank account. With production on hold, Fisker has warned investors that it will not survive the year without a fresh injection of cash. While Fisker had been in talks with other automakers, including Mazda, only Nissan had remained at the negotiating table.

Fisker announced on Monday morning that it is now exploring other options, including potential tie-ups with other companies or pursuing different strategic alternatives. These alternatives may involve in or out of court restructurings, capital market transactions (subject to market conditions), debt refinancing, the potential issuance of equity securities, the sale of assets and businesses, or other strategic measures.

In conclusion, the termination of negotiations with a large automaker has put Fisker's near-term funding efforts in jeopardy. The company's stock has taken a significant hit, and it is now exploring other options to secure its future. Fisker's challenges continue to mount, but the company remains committed to finding a solution and moving forward in the EV market.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1236611991.jpg?resize=1200,759",2024-03-25 13:52:11,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/03/25/stellar-blade-demo-gets-a-release-date-progress-will-carry-over-to-launch/,"‘Stellar Blade’ Demo Gets A Release Date, Progress Will Carry Over To Launch","Stellar Blade: A Promising Action Game with a Unique Twist

Stellar Blade, an action game that has sparked a lot of discussion due to its particular focus on a specific aspect of the protagonist, promises to be an exciting experience beyond the controversy. And now, players will have the opportunity to try it out for themselves, completely free of charge, very soon.

Game director Hyung Tae Kim recently announced that there will be an upcoming free demo of Stellar Blade, exclusively available on the PlayStation 5. The demo is set to release on March 29 at 7 AM PDT. Kim shared some details about what players can expect from the demo:

""The demo will take you through the opening sequence of the game, where Eve, a member of the 7th Airborne Squad, is sent on a mission to reclaim Earth from the Naytiba. You will embark on a journey from the tutorial phase to the first boss fight, exploring the post-war Eidos 7, a once-thriving human city now infested by the Naytiba. This initial stage will allow you to familiarize yourself with the game's basic combat features and grasp the gameplay mechanics that will accompany you throughout the game's story.""

Moreover, Kim mentioned that there would be a surprise for players who successfully complete the first stage of the demo. Additionally, any progress made in the demo will carry over to the full game's release on April 26, one month later. However, players need to make sure to keep their PS5 save data even if they uninstall the demo after playing.

April is an excellent time for Stellar Blade to launch, as it is poised to be one of the most highly anticipated releases of the month. The only other major release in April is Hellblade 2 on Xbox, which comes out later in May. Furthermore, April 30 will see the debut of Sea of Thieves on PS5. Although these two games may not directly compete with Stellar Blade, it's an exciting month for gamers.

The game's protagonist has been the subject of much online discussion due to the jiggle-physics design choice, which has sparked a debate about the portrayal of female characters in games. While the design may harken back to a different era, Stellar Blade itself appears to be a fast-paced and thrilling experience.

Software is undergoing a transformation, commonly referred to as digital transformation. This shift involves the use of cloud-native infrastructures to power always-on applications for both enterprise and consumer use, including gaming.

However, software modernization is a continuous process. What was considered modern last year may not be modern today, and what is modern today may become outdated by next year. Although advancements like generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) can have a meteoric rise, most changes do not happen that quickly.

To keep up with the ever-changing landscape of technology, the IT industry conducts reports, surveys, and analysis initiatives. These efforts provide quantifiers, qualifiers, and identifiers that help us understand the trends and changes in IT.

For example, Red Hat's recent ""State of Application Modernization Report"" in collaboration with research firm Illuminas reveals new movements in the industry. While enterprise application containers were popular last year, the report suggests that the focus has shifted towards Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines to accommodate the always-on world of connected cloud.

It's important to note that trends in software modernization are not static. Next year, containers may regain popularity along with the integration of generative AI.

Another company, Nutanix, is also monitoring the software modernization agenda. In their sixth global Enterprise Cloud Index (ECI) survey and research report, Nutanix highlights the increasing adoption of hybrid multi-cloud models. These models combine private on-premises clouds with public cloud services from various Cloud Services Providers (CSPs). The adoption of hybrid multi-cloud is expected to double over the next one to three years.

Hybrid multi-cloud refers to a combination of private and public cloud services, as well as services from multiple CSPs. Organizations make variegated purchasing decisions based on factors like price, local data governance, technical requirements, and more. Poly-cloud is another term that can be used, where a monolithic application distributes its workloads across different clouds.

Software modernization is driven by various factors, including AI, security, and sustainability. As organizations navigate the complexities of moving applications and data across environments, the Nutanix report emphasizes the use of hybrid multi-cloud infrastructure. It reveals that security and innovation were the main drivers for application migration over the past year. Additionally, respondents identified increasing investments in AI strategy as their top priority, followed closely by investment in IT modernization.

IT organizations are under increasing pressure to modernize their infrastructure quickly due to AI, sustainability, and security imperatives. In fact, 80% of survey respondents plan to invest in IT modernization, with 85% planning to increase their investment in this area.

Overall, software modernization is an ongoing process that requires organizations to stay updated with the latest trends and adapt their IT infrastructure accordingly. The adoption of hybrid multi-cloud models and investments in AI and IT modernization are key strategies for organizations to remain competitive in the evolving digital landscape.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660181597188fb59284d9023/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 10:28:24,Innovation,Innovation
