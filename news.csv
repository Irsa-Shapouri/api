A recent study involving over 200,000 individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) revealed a significant finding regarding the use of ADHD stimulant medications. Researchers discovered that those prescribed these medications had a reduced risk of suicide attempts and psychiatric hospitalizations. Specifically, four ADHD medications—amphetamine, lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate—were associated with a lower likelihood of psychiatric hospitalizations.

The study, led by Heidi Taipale and her team at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, delved into the impact of ADHD medications on individuals with the disorder. Notably, the use of lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate was linked to a decreased risk of suicidal behavior. This finding is crucial given the high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities among individuals with ADHD. Conditions such as major depressive disorder, panic disorder, substance abuse, and anxiety disorders are common in this population.

Previous research has shown that psychiatric comorbidities can exacerbate the mortality risk for individuals with ADHD, especially in cases of substance use disorder. While atomoxetine, another ADHD medication, did not show a direct association with reduced psychiatric hospitalizations or suicidal behavior, it was linked to fewer hospitalizations for non-psychiatric comorbidities.

The study spanned a 15-year follow-up period and included individuals aged 16 to 65 years in Sweden who had been diagnosed with ADHD between 2006 and 2021. By analyzing healthcare data from the Swedish National Patient Register, the researchers were able to track medication use and outcomes among the participants. Methylphenidate emerged as the most commonly prescribed ADHD medication, followed by lisdexamphetamine and atomoxetine.

Interestingly, the study found variations in the effectiveness of different medications based on age and gender. While lisdexamphetamine showed a decreased risk of psychiatric hospitalizations across various age groups, methylphenidate appeared to be less effective in older adults. Additionally, atomoxetine was associated with a reduced risk of hospitalization among women but not men.

The overall impact of ADHD medications on psychiatric outcomes was positive, with a lower risk of both psychiatric and non-psychiatric hospitalizations. Despite concerns about potential adverse effects such as increased blood pressure and heart rate, the study highlighted the beneficial effects of these medications in improving the quality of life for individuals with ADHD.

Published in JAMA Network Open, this study sheds light on the complex relationship between ADHD medications and psychiatric outcomes. By identifying specific medications that can mitigate the risk of suicide attempts and hospitalizations, the research offers valuable insights for healthcare providers and individuals managing ADHD.

Public health is like the offensive line in football, often overlooked until something goes wrong. The new TV series, ""The Invisible Shield,"" sheds light on the critical work of public health professionals. Premiering on PBS on March 26, this four-episode series aims to highlight the essential role of public health in protecting communities.

The title ""The Invisible Shield"" reflects the unnoticed efforts of the public health system in safeguarding society from various health threats. Despite its vital function, public health often remains invisible amidst the noise of celebrity gossip and commercial interests. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the vulnerabilities of underfunded and underappreciated public health systems, emphasizing the urgent need for increased support and resources.

The series aims to raise awareness about public health and its significant impact on daily life.

Produced by RadicalMedia with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies, ""The Invisible Shield"" seeks to elevate public health in the public consciousness. While celebrities and businesses dominate the media landscape, public health achievements such as vaccinations and clean water supplies often go unrecognized. The series underscores the life-saving contributions of public health that are often taken for granted.

The first episode, ""The Old Playbook,"" delves into the historical advancements in public health that have doubled life expectancy since 1900. However, it also highlights the current threats facing the public health system. By drawing on past experiences with epidemics, the series explores the challenges of adapting to the COVID-19 pandemic and the lessons learned along the way.

In ""Follow the Data,"" the second episode, the importance of data collection and analysis in public health is underscored. Data-driven decision-making plays a crucial role in managing health crises and guiding public health interventions. The episode delves into the significance of utilizing data to inform public health strategies and initiatives.

As the series unfolds, viewers will gain insight into the critical role of public health in safeguarding communities and promoting well-being. By shedding light on the invisible yet essential work of public health professionals, ""The Invisible Shield"" aims to spark conversations and foster greater support for public health initiatives. Tune in to discover the untold stories behind public health's invisible shield and the impact it has on our lives.

As the last Sunday before Easter unfolds, a sudden shift in the weather brings snow and winds, replacing the warm spring days we enjoyed. Amidst this wintry surprise, what better way to spend the day than diving into a challenging game? The New York Times presents Strands, a word search puzzle that will put your word-finding skills to the test.

In this beta version of Strands, you are tasked with uncovering words on a six by eight grid that share a common theme. Each day presents a new grid, along with clues to guide you. Discover the theme words that remain highlighted in blue and hunt for the special word known as the spangram, connecting opposite sides of the board and highlighted in yellow.

Today's theme hint for the Strands puzzle is ""Lock steps."" For an extra nudge towards the answers, think about ""Shampoo."" Now, brace yourself for the reveal of today's solutions.

The spangram for today is ""HAIRCARE,"" anchoring the words in the grid. Once you spot the spangram, the other words fall into place. The list includes ""Apply,"" ""Rinse,"" ""Towel,"" ""Conditioner,"" ""Lather,"" and ""Moisturizer.""

Today's challenge proved to be a tough nut to crack, with clues like ""apply"" leading to a haircare routine rather than locks or steps in the traditional sense. It's a playful twist on everyday tasks like washing your hair, adding a fun dimension to the puzzle-solving experience. And who knew shampoo could spark such brain-teasing fun?

Reflecting on the puzzle, it's reminiscent of Adam Sandler's iconic scene in Billy Madison, where conditioner reigns supreme.

Apple's AI Plans for the iPhone: A Potential Partnership with Google and Baidu

As Apple gears up to announce its AI plans for the iPhone, it seems that the tech giant is looking to strengthen its ties with both Google and Baidu. With every major Android phone release touting generative AI capabilities, Apple's iPhone 15 family has fallen behind in the market. However, the upcoming iOS 18, set to be launched at this year's Worldwide Developer Conference, promises to introduce generative AI to the next-generation iPhone 16 family.

Like other smartphone manufacturers, Apple will focus on on-device and in-the-cloud AI processing. Apple is known for prioritizing local processing and keeping data on the device whenever possible. However, for AI applications that require extensive processing power, the cloud will be utilized.

To harness the power of the cloud, Apple is reportedly working on a partnership with Google. By using Google's Gemini generative AI service, Apple aims to leverage the massive user base of AI-equipped iPhone owners to enhance its AI capabilities. This collaboration between Apple and Google, despite their rivalry in the smartphone market, is not unprecedented. The two companies have previously worked together, such as ensuring Google is the default search engine on Apple devices.

However, there is a hurdle to overcome in China. Due to various factors, including government regulations and vetting processes, Google's Gemini service is not available in the country. In light of this, Apple has begun negotiations with China's Baidu. Baidu's cloud-based AI services are being considered for integration into the upcoming iOS 18 and iPhone 16 family.

Apple is not the only company pursuing this strategy. Samsung, during its recent Galaxy Unpacked event, unveiled not only the new Galaxy S24 family but also its Galaxy AI services, some of which rely on Google Gemini. Similarly, for the Chinese market, Samsung has partnered with Baidu to offer AI services.

It remains to be seen how Apple will differentiate its AI services from its competitors, considering that they are built on the same underlying technology. Nevertheless, this move by Apple signifies its commitment to catching up with the AI capabilities offered by Android devices.

The world of combat sports is no stranger to intense moments, but sometimes athletes can take things too far. This was evident at UFC Fight Night: Ribas vs. Namajunas when Igor Severino made a shocking move during his debut in the octagon.
In a surprising turn of events, Severino bit his opponent, Andre Lima, during their fight, leading to his disqualification in the second round. Images clearly showed the bite marks on Lima's arm, leaving no room for doubt about what had transpired.
Severino, a 20-year-old fighter with potential, may have ruined his chances of further success in the UFC with this unsportsmanlike behavior. This incident marked the first loss of his career, bringing his record to 9-1, while Lima maintained his undefeated streak at 8-0.
UFC President Dana White wasted no time in addressing the issue, promptly announcing Severino's release from the promotion. White emphasized the severity of the situation, highlighting the missed opportunity for both fighters and potential legal consequences for Severino.
Biting in combat sports is a rare but serious offense that can have lasting repercussions. Lima's composed reaction to the incident showed remarkable restraint, underscoring the gravity of Severino's actions.
Moving forward, Severino will need to rebuild his reputation in smaller organizations before earning a shot at redemption in the UFC or other major MMA promotions.
As the dust settles on this controversial bout, fans can expect more updates on the outcomes of Saturday's fights in Las Vegas. Stay tuned for the latest developments in the world of mixed martial arts.

Lazy Sunday is here, and with it comes the excitement of solving today's Wordle puzzle. But before we dive into that, let me share a little confession. One day, I hope to make rabbit pot pies for Easter. The combination of savory goodness and the sweet irony seems too perfect to pass up. But for now, let's focus on Wordle.

Are you ready to solve today's Wordle? Let me give you a hint: it's something that is useful when dry but useless when wet. And here's a clue: the word starts with a consonant. Now, if you want to avoid spoilers, look away!

Now, let's analyze the Wordle. Every day, I eagerly check my results using Wordle Bot. It's a great tool to see how well you did. Today, my first guess was ""chain,"" but that left me with a staggering 681 possibilities. Thankfully, my next guess, ""slope,"" narrowed it down to a more manageable 19 options. Finally, I settled on ""below,"" and to my surprise, it was the correct answer! Maybe it was just a lucky coincidence, or maybe the Wordle puzzle and today's Strands puzzle had some cosmic connection. Who knows?

Unfortunately, my competitive Wordle score for today is a total wash. I didn't score any points for guessing in four tries, and I didn't tie with the Wordle Bot either. Zeroes all around! But hey, that's the fun and challenge of Wordle.

Now, let's take a moment to explore the etymology of the word ""towel."" The term has its roots in Old French, where it was known as ""touaille."" Over time, it made its way into English usage around the 13th century. The Old French word is believed to have derived from the Medieval Latin term ""tovaglia,"" which likely came from the Latin word ""tubicula,"" meaning ""tube"" or ""cloth."" This linguistic evolution reflects the item's original purpose as a piece of cloth used for drying or wiping.

The transformation from ""touaille"" to ""towel"" showcases the influence of Norman French on the English language after the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. Many French words underwent pronunciation and spelling changes as they were Anglicized, resulting in the modern English word ""towel"" that we use today. Throughout history, towels have been a household staple, evolving in materials and usage but always serving the same fundamental purpose: drying or wiping.

Before we wrap up, I invite you to check out my blog, where you'll find daily Wordle guides, as well as my thoughts on TV shows, streaming recommendations, movie reviews, video game coverage, and much more. Thank you for joining me today, and happy Wordle solving!

https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/23/google-upgrade-samsung-s24-s23-pixel-towards-apple-iphone-15-pro-max/,Google Suddenly Reveals Surprise Android Update That Beats iPhone,"

Android and iPhone are constantly competing for users, and now Google has introduced a new feature that surpasses Apple. In its latest update, Google is making Android more like iPhone and even adding features that go beyond what Apple offers.

One notable feature that Google has added is an emergency satellite service, which brings Android on par with the satellite SOS functionality that Apple has had for a few years. However, Google's offering seems to include a Garmin rescue service, making it a significant step forward for user safety and security.

The issue with Apple's emergency SOS feature is that it is only for emergencies. It displays an SOS tag on the screen when users are out of coverage, but it is not something that is commonly used. On the other hand, the latest Android 15 developer preview suggests that Google is bridging the gap by allowing users to expand their cellular accounts to include a satellite add-on. This enables core messaging apps to use the satellite network, eliminating cellular black spots and ensuring connectivity even in remote areas.

According to Mishaal Rahman, Android 15 DP2 introduces UI elements for devices that support satellite connectivity and expands platform support for satellite connectivity through a new API that apps can use to detect satellite connection. Additionally, Android 15 allows SMS/MMS/RCS apps to utilize satellite connectivity for sending and receiving messages.

Apple's satellite connectivity remains limited. Users with iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15, or iPhone 15 Pro can connect their phones to a satellite to text emergency services, request roadside assistance, and share their location with friends and family when they have no mobile or Wi-Fi coverage. Android, on the other hand, has the potential for even more with beta code suggesting a satellite messaging option in partnership with T-Mobile.

The possibility of direct-to-phone satellite connectivity becoming more common is exciting. Elon Musk's announcement that SpaceX achieved download speeds of 17mbps to an unmodified Galaxy S21 Ultra sparked interest in the potential of this technology. It means that smartphones could make and receive calls and messages by connecting directly to a satellite, even in areas without cellular network coverage. While this future is still on the horizon, the integration of satellite connectivity into messaging apps is a great start.

The arrival of satellite messaging in Android 15 confirms that Google is leading the way, with Apple likely to follow suit. This development comes shortly after the news that Gemini might be coming to iPhone and Apple claiming that the DOJ lawsuit could turn iPhone into Android. The competition between Android and iPhone continues to intensify.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/23/explained-the-difference-between-a-solar-eclipse-and-a-lunar-eclipse/,Explained: The Difference Between A Solar Eclipse And A Lunar Eclipse,"

Have you ever wondered about the difference between a solar eclipse and a lunar eclipse? Well, in the next few weeks, we'll have the chance to witness both of these incredible celestial events. On Monday, March 25, there will be a lunar eclipse, followed by a solar eclipse on Monday, April 8. Although they may seem similar, these two phenomena are actually quite different, but they are both caused by the same alignment of celestial bodies.

Let's start with the lunar eclipse. This occurs when Earth's shadow is projected onto the moon. It can only happen during a full moon when Earth is positioned between the sun and the moon, creating a shadow in space. However, lunar eclipses are quite rare because the moon rarely passes through Earth's shadow. So, when it does happen, it's quite a spectacle.

On the other hand, a solar eclipse happens when the moon blocks the sun's light and casts a shadow on Earth. This can only occur during a new moon when the moon is positioned between the sun and Earth, projecting its shadow onto our planet. Similar to lunar eclipses, solar eclipses are also quite rare because the moon's orbit and the Earth's orbit around the sun are not perfectly aligned. So, when we do get to witness a solar eclipse, it's truly a remarkable event.

Now, you might be wondering what causes these fascinating celestial phenomena. Well, let's break it down. A total lunar eclipse occurs when there is a perfect alignment of the sun, Earth, and moon. Earth has two shadows—the outer penumbral shadow and the dark central umbral shadow. When a full moon drifts into Earth's umbral shadow, it is no longer directly illuminated by the sun. Instead, the only light reaching the moon's surface is sunlight refracted by Earth's atmosphere. This creates a mesmerizing effect, turning the moon a pinkish-red color—a ""Blood Moon."" If you were standing on the moon during a lunar eclipse, you would be bathed in this pinkish-red light and witness a partial or total solar eclipse.

On March 25, we will experience a penumbral lunar eclipse, where the full ""Worm Moon"" will pass through Earth's penumbra, creating a subtle shadowy effect.

Now, let's move on to a total solar eclipse. This phenomenon occurs when there is a perfect alignment of the sun, moon, and Earth, along with a celestial fluke. Just like the new moon has two shadows—the outer penumbral shadow and the dark central umbral shadow—the moon's umbra is projected onto Earth when it perfectly blocks the sun. This can only happen because the moon is about 400 times smaller than the sun but also 400 times closer to Earth. It's a unique coincidence that allows us to witness a total eclipse of the sun.

During a total solar eclipse, the moon's shadow moves across Earth's surface as it orbits from west to east. This happens to be the same direction that Earth rotates, which slows down the movement of the moon's shadow. As a result, an umbral shadow—a path of totality—is created, where lucky observers can witness something truly incredible. Imagine standing on the moon during a total solar eclipse and seeing the moon's shadow crossing Earth.

On April 8, we will have the opportunity to witness a total solar eclipse. The new ""Pink Moon"" will block the sun perfectly, projecting an umbral shadow over North America. It's an event that shouldn't be missed!

You may be wondering why lunar and solar eclipses are so rare. Well, it's because the moon's orbit around Earth is tilted about 5 degrees with respect to the sun's path through the sky. This means that the moon's path intersects the sun's path twice in each orbit, but for an eclipse to occur, the moon must be in its new or full phase. This scenario only happens twice a year, creating two ""eclipse seasons"" when solar and lunar eclipses are more likely. However, most solar eclipses are either partial or annular (""ring of fire""), while most lunar eclipses are penumbral or partial.

Looking ahead, let's take a peek at the upcoming lunar and solar eclipses in 2024 and 2025. In 2024, we can expect two eclipse seasons starting on March 25 and September 17. The first will bring a penumbral lunar eclipse visible in North America, followed by a total solar eclipse that will also be visible in North America. Later in the year, on September 17, there will be a partial lunar eclipse visible in North America, followed by an annular solar eclipse visible in the Pacific Ocean and South America on October 2.

Moving on to 2025, there will be two eclipse seasons starting on March 13 and September 7. In March, we can look forward to a total lunar eclipse visible in North America, followed by a partial solar eclipse visible in Canada and northern Europe on March 29. In September, there will be another total lunar eclipse visible in Asia, and later in the month, a partial solar eclipse visible in Antarctica on September 21.

So, mark your calendars and get ready for these spectacular celestial events. Whether it's a lunar eclipse or a solar eclipse, witnessing these rare occurrences is a truly awe-inspiring experience. Remember to stay updated for the latest information on the upcoming total solar eclipse on April 8. Clear skies and wide eyes!
