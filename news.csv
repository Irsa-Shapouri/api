https://www.zdnet.com/article/saving-hours-of-work-with-ai-how-chatgpt-became-my-virtual-assistant-for-a-data-project/,Saving hours of work with AI: How ChatGPT became my virtual assistant for a data project,"Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been making waves in the tech world recently, and tools like ChatGPT have garnered a lot of attention. As an experienced content editor, I've had my fair share of excitement over these AI tools, but it's important to remember that they're just that – tools. They can be incredibly helpful in streamlining projects, just like any other productivity software.

Today, I want to walk you through a project where ChatGPT saved me a significant amount of time. While your specific project may not align with mine, I hope to share my thought process behind using ChatGPT as a valuable workhorse tool for various projects.

Let's dive into the project itself. In about a month, I plan to publish what I like to call a ""stunt article."" These articles are fun projects that I know readers will find interesting. This particular article will be a rundown of how much computer gear I can buy from Temu for under $100. Spoiler alert: I managed to come in at $99.77.

Putting this article together required scouring the Temu website for noteworthy items. For example, I stumbled upon an iPad keyboard and mouse combo that only cost about $6. To stay within my budget, I wanted to compile all the Temu links in a spreadsheet, find the price for each item, and rearrange things until I reached my desired total budget.

The challenge I faced was converting the Temu links into a usable format. This is where ChatGPT came to the rescue.

Phase 1: Gathering the links
To begin, I collected all the Temu links. For each product, I copied the link from the website and pasted it into a Notion page. Notion conveniently allows you to create bookmark blocks when pasting URLs, which not only contain the links but also include the product names. Here's a glimpse of that page:

[Include screenshot of the Notion page]

Phase 2: Identifying the data
Now, let's take a closer look at one of the data blocks. I've switched my editor to light mode for better visibility:

[Include screenshot of the data block]

Within each block, there are three crucial elements. The product name is highlighted in gold text and enclosed in braces. The base URL is highlighted in green text and enclosed in parentheses. There's also a question mark that separates the main page URL from additional tracking data, which I didn't need. I simply wanted the main URL. The delimiters are highlighted in purple, indicating the data we'll feed into ChatGPT.

Phase 3: Teaching ChatGPT to recognize the data
To instruct ChatGPT, I provided the following prompt:

""Accept the following data and await further instructions.""

Then, I copied all the information from the text editor and pasted it into ChatGPT. At this point, ChatGPT knew to wait for more details.

The next step was crucial. I wanted ChatGPT to extract the titles and links while discarding the rest. Here's the prompt I used:

""The data above consists of a series of blocks. Each block begins with a section enclosed in [] brackets, which we will designate as the TITLE. Following the brackets is an opening parenthesis (followed by a web URL), which we will extract as the URL. Dispose of everything after the question mark, including the question mark itself. Most URLs will end in .html. Display each TITLE followed by a carriage return, then the URL, and finally two newlines.""

This process served two purposes. Firstly, it allowed me to assign names to the data for future reference. Secondly, it served as a test for ChatGPT's understanding of the assignment.

ChatGPT successfully completed the assignment, but it ran out of buffer space around two-thirds of the way through. I prompted it to continue, and it provided the remaining data. Doing this manually would have involved tedious copying and pasting, but ChatGPT completed the task in less than a minute.

Phase 4: Cleaning up Temu's titles
Temu's titles were overly complex for my project. Instead of lengthy titles like ""10 Inch LCD Writing Tablet, Electronis Memo With Leather Protective Case, Electronic Drawing Board For Digital Handwriting Pad Doodle Board, Gifts For,"" I wanted something more concise like ""LCD writing tablet with case."" I assigned this task to ChatGPT as well, reminding it that it had already parsed and identified the data. I find that reminding ChatGPT about previous steps helps it better incorporate the information.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-large-language-simple-mechanism-knowledge.html,Large language models use a surprisingly simple mechanism to retrieve some stored knowledge,"Large language models (LLMs) are incredibly complex tools used in various areas such as customer support, code generation, and language translation. Despite their widespread use, scientists still have limited understanding of how these models work. To gain insight into their inner workings, researchers from MIT and other institutions have delved into how LLMs retrieve stored knowledge.

The researchers made an intriguing discovery: LLMs often employ a simple linear function to decode and retrieve facts. These linear functions, which involve two variables and no exponents, capture the straightforward relationship between variables. What's more, the model uses the same decoding function for similar types of facts. By identifying these linear functions for different facts, researchers can examine the model's knowledge of new subjects and locate where that knowledge is stored within the model.

Using a novel technique to estimate these simple functions, the researchers found that even when a model provides an incorrect answer, it often retains the correct information. This approach could be used in the future to identify and rectify falsehoods within the model, reducing its tendency to produce incorrect or nonsensical responses.

According to Evan Hernandez, an electrical engineering and computer science graduate student at MIT and co-lead author of the study, ""Even though these models are really complicated, nonlinear functions that are trained on lots of data and are very hard to understand, there are sometimes really simple mechanisms working inside them. This is one instance of that.""

Hernandez collaborated with Arnab Sharma, a computer science graduate student at Northeastern University, and their advisors, Jacob Andreas from MIT and David Bau from Northeastern University, along with other researchers from MIT, Harvard University, and the Israeli Institute of Technology. They will present their research at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024) in Vienna.

LLMs, also known as transformer models, are neural networks inspired by the human brain. These networks consist of billions of interconnected nodes, or neurons, organized into layers to encode and process data. The knowledge stored in a transformer model can be represented as relations connecting subjects and objects. For example, the relation ""Miles Davis plays the trumpet"" connects the subject, Miles Davis, to the object, trumpet.

As the transformer model acquires more knowledge, it stores additional facts about a particular subject across multiple layers. When a user queries the model about that subject, it must decode the most relevant fact to provide an accurate response. The researchers aimed to understand the mechanism responsible for this decoding process.

To investigate LLMs, the researchers conducted a series of experiments and discovered that despite their complexity, these models use a simple linear function to decode relational information. Each decoding function is specific to the type of fact being retrieved. For instance, the model would utilize one decoding function to output the instrument a person plays and a different function to output the state where a person was born.

The researchers developed a method to estimate these simple functions and computed functions for 47 different relations, such as ""capital city of a country"" and ""lead singer of a band."" Although there are countless possible relations, the researchers focused on this subset as it represents the types of facts that can be expressed in this manner.

To test each function, the researchers modified the subject to assess whether it could recover the correct object information. Overall, their findings shed light on the inner workings of LLMs and provide a framework for understanding how these models retrieve and decode stored knowledge.

In conclusion, the study reveals that despite their complexity, large language models employ simple linear functions to retrieve and decode facts. This discovery opens up possibilities for identifying and correcting falsehoods within these models, ultimately improving their accuracy and reliability. The researchers' methodology for estimating these functions serves as a valuable tool for further exploration of LLMs and their mechanisms.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/large-language-models-2.jpg,2024-03-25 09:34:06,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/25/99-is-not-total-the-worst-places-to-watch-the-solar-eclipse/,99% Is Not Total: The Worst Places To Watch The Solar Eclipse,"Cincinnati and Columbus, Ohio are both located outside the path of totality for the upcoming solar eclipse on April 8. It's important to double-check the exact location of any eclipse-observing event you plan to attend, as many organizers either lack knowledge or transparency about whether guests will actually witness a total solar eclipse.

A total solar eclipse offers a captivating experience of a few minutes of darkness and the opportunity to see the sun's corona with the naked eye. However, this can only be fully experienced within the 115-mile wide path of totality that will pass through parts of 15 U.S. states on April 8.

Unfortunately, some events outside the path of totality use misleading phrases like ""partial totality"" or ""99% total eclipse"" in their promotions. The truth is, if you're not within the path of totality, you won't witness anything extraordinary. Instead, you'll only see a partial solar eclipse, which last occurred in North America on October 14, 2021, and before that, on June 10, 2021.

To help you avoid disappointment, here are a few examples of eclipse events and packages to steer clear of on April 8, along with alternative locations where you can experience totality:

1. COSI, Columbus, Ohio:
The Center for Science and Industry in Columbus, Ohio, is located outside the path of totality. Despite recently updating their website to clarify that their COSI's Eclipse Experience will only offer a partial solar eclipse, it's still puzzling why they have an event at all. Instead of staying in central Columbus, where COSI is located, you should head northwest towards Dublin or Marion to witness totality.

2. Science Central, Fort Wayne, Indiana:
Although Science Central in Fort Wayne, Indiana proudly claims to be near the path of totality, it's important to note that they are not actually within it. Their event will only offer a 99.89% partial solar eclipse. If you're looking for a true total eclipse experience, consider driving approximately 70 miles southeast to Wapakoneta, Neil Armstrong's hometown, where you can witness 3 minutes and 57 seconds of totality at the Armstrong Air & Space Museum.

3. Total Eclipse Party at Edgewater Sport Park, Cincinnati, Ohio:
Downtown Cincinnati is not within the path of totality, including the incorrectly named Total Eclipse Party at Edgewater Sports Park, which is located 25 miles west of downtown. Despite its promising name, this event will only offer a 99.998% partial solar eclipse. Instead, venture just nine miles northeast to Miami Whitewater Forest, where a free event will allow you to experience 1 minute and 14 seconds of totality, which can be life-changing.

4. The Alamo and River Walk, San Antonio:
San Antonio, like Columbus, will also be split by the edge of the path of totality, with only its northwest experiencing totality. Avoid events such as Solar Eclipse at the Alamo, The Moon's Daughters, and the Hyatt Regency San Antonio's ""Solar Eclipse Viewing Party,"" as none of them will offer a total solar eclipse. It's best to stay away from the River Walk and the Alamo on April 8. Instead, head to the northwest suburbs of San Antonio or further west into the Hill Country for a better chance of witnessing totality.

5. Hotel Ithaca, Ithaca, New York:
Hotel Ithaca in Ithaca, New York, offers a ""Solar Eclipse Package"" that includes a two-night stay and an ""Eclipse Cocktail Party"" on April 8. However, guests will be disappointed to learn that they could have traveled just 20 minutes north to experience the awe-inspiring phenomenon of a total solar eclipse. Instead, the hotel's location will only provide a ""99% Magnitude"" eclipse, which falls short of the transformative experience of totality.

In conclusion, when planning to observe the solar eclipse on April 8, it's crucial to ensure that your chosen event or location falls within the path of totality. Don't be misled by events outside the path that use misleading phrases or incomplete descriptions. By following the suggestions provided and venturing to the appropriate locations, you can witness the breathtaking beauty of a total solar eclipse.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6601750b9a60bff58d97df68/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3777,2126,x0,y395,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 19:00:13,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2024/03/25/generative-ai-can-create-just-about-everything-but-will-it-ever-create-jobs/,Generative AI Can Create Just About Everything-But Will It Ever Create Jobs?,"As we look towards the future defined by AI, it is becoming increasingly clear that generative AI technology, such as ChatGPT, has the potential to render certain job positions obsolete. Last year was a banner year for generative AI, with advancements in the technology allowing it to write letters, reports, and even movie scripts. This has led to downsizing in some sectors, such as IBM's marketing and communications team, as AI takes over certain tasks. In fact, a survey revealed that more than one-third of companies using AI reported that it had already replaced workers in 2023, with 44% predicting further layoffs in 2024.

The question we now face is no longer about the capabilities of generative AI, but rather about how human workers can remain relevant in a post-gen-AI world. As workers in the global economy, we need to accept the reality that efficiency always makes good business sense. Just as automation revolutionized manufacturing jobs, AI is set to do the same for many white-collar jobs, including marketing and beyond. The primary goal of businesses is to maximize profits, and any technology that enables faster work, increased productivity, and deeper insights will be viewed positively by executives. Research suggests that by 2030, approximately one-third of the hours currently worked in the US economy could be automated, thanks in part to generative AI.

While generative AI presents risks, it also offers opportunities. It is possible that new and more advanced roles will emerge in various fields, but this is not guaranteed. The work landscape is likely to become sporadic, peculiar, and different in the coming years. However, technological revolutions often create new and unexpected roles. For example, if AI allows programmers to develop a new game 50% faster and with fewer resources, we will still require fewer programmers for the task, even if the demand for the game increases. This means that we need to start thinking differently about work and our place in it as we embrace advancements in generative AI and future technologies. One thing is certain: acquiring new AI skills and adopting an ""AI mentality"" focused on automation and data-oriented value creation is crucial. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang has even suggested that becoming a programmer may no longer be the ultimate safety net.

So, which jobs are most likely to experience a significant pullback due to generative AI? Here is a list of the top 10 roles that AI can streamline, resulting in 50-80% fewer full-time equivalents (FTEs):

1. Website and copy development
2. Marketing automation
3. Sales and sales development representatives
4. Basic legal support for personal and business tax filing and basic business accounting
5. Customer service L1/L2
6. Light coding and application development
7. Social media content and press releases
8. Inventory management and optimization
9. HR and talent management and identification

These are just a few examples, but for startups and small businesses, the rapid development of vertical AI and LLM capabilities can significantly enhance productivity and efficiency while reducing personnel costs.

OpenAI's Sam Altman has suggested that in the future, we may see single-person billion-dollar companies. While this may seem far-fetched, it is increasingly likely that companies with 10-20 employees can generate over $100 million in revenue and potentially reach a billion with the intelligent use of generative AI and chatbots.

Generative AI can be viewed as both a competitor and a friend. It allows individuals with limited design or writing skills to create beautiful graphic layouts and generate letters, reports, and marketing campaigns. Additionally, AI can assess the success of these campaigns in real-time, allowing for immediate adjustments if needed. While it is true that AI is not perfect and has its limitations, it is improving every day at an astonishing rate as technology and algorithms advance.

So, how can you stay relevant in a world where AI is capable of performing so many tasks? Firstly, it is essential to stay engaged. In a time when it is tempting to let AI do all the work, resist this temptation. While AI can automate certain tasks, it cannot replace the creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills that humans possess. By actively participating in the tasks that AI cannot do, you can ensure your relevance in the workforce.

Furthermore, continuously learning and adapting to new technologies is crucial. Acquiring new skills, particularly in the field of AI, will help you navigate the changing job market and remain competitive. Embracing an ""AI mentality"" focused on automation and data-oriented value creation will also set you apart.

In conclusion, as generative AI continues to advance, it is vital for workers to adapt and embrace the changing landscape. While there are risks associated with AI replacing certain job positions, there are also opportunities to explore new and unexpected roles. By staying engaged, continuously learning, and adopting an AI mindset, workers can remain relevant and thrive in a post-gen-AI world.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660212b5f2d67f4b8ae63aa3/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 20:24:50,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-favorite-linux-text-editors-and-why-you-should-be-using-one/,My favorite Linux text editors (and why you should be using one),"Linux has always had text editors, and in the past, there were heated debates between supporters of emacs and vi. However, the role of text editors has evolved over time. While they were originally used for configuring Linux and writing code, they can now be used for a variety of purposes, including note-taking, journals, and even writing novels. I have personally used text editors for short stories and flash fiction, although I have never written a full-length book with one.

Before I proceed, I want to clarify that this list does not include vi or Emacs. While these editors are undoubtedly powerful, I find them to be more cumbersome than helpful. They are not suitable for everyday use or average users, which is the focus of this list. However, if you require more advanced features or flexibility, you can always turn to vi or Emacs for coding, configuring, and administering purposes.

Now, let's take a closer look at some text editors that are easier to use but still effective:

1. Nano
Nano has been my go-to text editor for decades. It may be basic, but it gets the job done. Nano has all the essential features I need, such as interactive search-and-replace, undo/redo, syntax coloring, smooth scrolling, auto-indentation, go-to-line-and-column-number, feature toggles, file locking, and internationalization support.

It is important to note that Nano is a terminal application, which means it does not have a GUI app. To use Nano, you open the terminal and issue the command ""nano filename"" (replace ""filename"" with the name of the file you want to edit or create). Nano offers several options, including ""--backup"" (creates a backup of the previous version of the file), ""--tabstospaces"" (converts typed tabs to spaces), ""--locking"" (locks the file when editing), ""--smooth"" (enables smooth scrolling), and more.

Nano is free and comes pre-installed with most Linux distributions.

2. Gedit
Gedit is the default text editor for the GNOME desktop environment. It is a basic but effective GUI application. Gedit offers features like tabs, support for internationalized text (UTF-8), syntax highlighting, markdown support, configurable fonts and colors, print support, auto-save, auto backup creation, keyboard shortcuts, theming, full-screen mode, and more.

What I like about Gedit is its simplicity. Although I usually prefer Nano, when I need a GUI, Gedit is my go-to choice. Another reason I keep Gedit around is that Nano must be opened from the terminal window, which means clicking on a link to a text file doesn't work as expected. In such cases, Gedit comes in handy. Additionally, Gedit can be used in fullscreen mode, allowing me to edit text files without distractions.

Gedit is free and comes pre-installed with most GNOME-based desktop distributions.

3. COSMIC Text Editor
COSMIC Text Editor will be the default text editor for System76's COSMIC desktop once it is released. However, the COSMIC Text Editor is already showing great progress and is expected to be the Gedit equivalent for COSMIC. It will include features such as syntax highlighting, standard keyboard shortcuts, find and spellcheck functions, project support, revert changes, document statistics, and even Git management support.

Although I rarely prefer dark themes, COSMIC Text Editor seems to be an exception. Like Gedit, COSMIC Text Editor is simple to use and can handle basic tasks as well as more complex ones like coding. If you use Pop!_OS, you can get a glimpse of what COSMIC Text Editor will look and feel like by installing it from the Pop Shop.

COSMIC Text Editor will be free and officially available when the COSMIC Desktop OS is released.

4. Kate
Kate is to KDE Plasma what Gedit is to GNOME. The main difference is that Kate offers a few more features, such as multi-cursor and multi-cursor selection, which allow you to select and manipulate multiple strings of text simultaneously. Kate also features project support, syntax highlighting, standard keyboard shortcuts, and plugins. With plugins, you can enhance Kate's functionality by adding support for SQL queries, GDB debugging, one-click project build, and more. Think of Kate as a supercharged version of Gedit that can handle simple text files as well as more complex tasks.

Kate is free and can be installed on KDE Plasma-based distributions.

In conclusion, text editors have come a long way since the infamous editor wars of the past. While vi and Emacs are not included in this list, there are plenty of user-friendly alternatives available. Whether you prefer the simplicity of Nano, the convenience of Gedit, the future promise of COSMIC Text Editor, or the feature-richness of Kate, there is a text editor out there to suit your needs.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/feda4ca65eefc13df0e3505780d84330ecd3c713/2024/03/25/d964a97e-9c56-444a-9497-19bc7ca26a56/typingclosegettyimages-1341060766.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-pairing-crypto-green-hydrogen-energy.html,"Pairing crypto mining with green hydrogen offers clean energy boost, study suggests","Pairing cryptocurrency mining, which is known for its high carbon emissions, with green hydrogen technology could be a game-changer for renewable energy. A recent study from Cornell University reveals that by combining these two elements, we can accelerate the adoption of solar and wind power and move closer to a sustainable future.

Cryptocurrency mining has been a major contributor to global carbon emissions. Therefore, it is crucial to find ways to harness the growing interest in cryptocurrencies and channel it towards sustainable and climate-friendly solutions. Fengqi You, a professor of energy systems engineering at Cornell, emphasizes the need to explore opportunities for leveraging cryptocurrency's popularity for the greater good.

In their research paper titled ""Climate Sustainability Through a Dynamic Duo: Green Hydrogen and Crypto Driving Energy Transition and Decarbonization,"" You and Apoorv Lal, a doctoral student, propose a solution that can revolutionize the renewable energy sector. They refer to the combination of energy-intensive cryptocurrency mining with green hydrogen technology as the ""dynamic duo"" that can pave the way for a more sustainable energy landscape.

The researchers argue that establishing a green hydrogen infrastructure to support cryptocurrency production can have a twofold benefit. Firstly, it can accelerate the growth of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power. Secondly, it can contribute to the overall sustainability of the energy sector.

Currently, the process of mining blockchain-based cryptocurrency in the United States consumes a significant amount of carbon-based energy. In fact, it uses as much energy as the entire country of Argentina, according to a report from the White House Office of Science and Technology. The majority of this energy consumption comes from the computer-intensive consensus mechanisms used to verify crypto-assets, known as ""proof of work.""

To address this environmental challenge, the researchers propose leveraging cryptocurrencies as virtual energy carriers in conjunction with green hydrogen technology. This innovative approach can transform the negative impact of cryptocurrency mining into a positive force for climate mitigation and sustainability.

The study also examines the potential energy strengths of different U.S. states. By supporting cryptocurrency mining, additional energy infrastructure can be built, leading to the generation of renewable energy. For instance, in New Mexico, each Bitcoin mined could potentially produce 78.4 megawatt hours of solar power, while in Wyoming, it could generate 265.8 megawatt hours of wind power.

It is important to note that cryptocurrency holds an intangible value, much like a virtual gift card. Similarly, it can also possess an energy value. Therefore, by recognizing this energy value and integrating it with green hydrogen, we can unlock new possibilities for sustainable development.

For this vision to become a reality, the researchers emphasize the need for stronger federal policies that prioritize climate goals and renewable energy. By coupling cryptocurrency with green hydrogen, we can not only address the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining but also pioneer a sustainable path for the transition to renewable energy.

Fengqi You, a senior faculty fellow at the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability, believes that this approach represents a novel strategy that has the potential to revolutionize the cryptocurrency industry and contribute significantly to our fight against climate change.

In conclusion, the combination of cryptocurrency mining and green hydrogen technology holds immense promise for a sustainable energy future. By harnessing the popularity and energy consumption of cryptocurrencies, we can accelerate the growth of renewable energy sources and drive the transition towards a more sustainable and climate-friendly world. It is crucial that we embrace this innovative strategy and work towards stronger policies that support this transformative approach.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2023/cryptocurrencies.jpg,2024-03-25 15:00:02,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/25/google-update-warning-chrome-windows-11-android-iphone/,Google’s New AI Search Goes Horribly Wrong-M Is For Malware,"Google's new AI search feature, called the Search Generative Experience (SGE), has encountered some unexpected problems. While Google aims to enhance search results with generative AI, the first update has yielded concerning results. An SEO consultant discovered scams within the search results, and Bleeping Computer confirmed this issue. The scams ranged from fake iPhone giveaways to tech support scams and unwanted browser extensions. The danger lies in the fact that these scams are disguised in friendly and approachable language, catching users off guard.

The fraudulent redirects primarily targeted personal information, adware, and unwanted subscriptions. Some links even engaged in more malicious behavior, such as search hijacking. Google acknowledged the problem and stated that they are constantly updating their spam-fighting systems to combat these issues. They have also taken action to remove the examples of scams that were reported.

Initially, SGE was an opt-in feature, but Google is now expanding its reach. They are starting to show SGE AI-powered overviews to users who have not signed up, but only on a small percentage of search traffic in certain categories in the United States. It's important to note that the examples of scams were from an opt-in Search Labs user, not a general user. Hopefully, as SGE becomes more widely available, these issues will be resolved.

Despite these initial problems, AI search is undoubtedly the future. However, this serves as a reminder to be cautious when exploring new technologies. Even though the language used may seem friendly, the usual rules of safe searching still apply. As search becomes more integrated into generative AI chatbots, the risks may increase. Therefore, improvements in filters and defenses are necessary before this integration takes place.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6602155031526c87ed877205/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3115,2027,x1040,y734,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 21:15:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/25/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-upgrade-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-s23/,Apple’s Surprise Update Just Made iPhone More Like Android,"Apple’s recent AI news has caused quite a stir, and the latest rumor appears to have been confirmed. Whatever happens next, it seems that everything has changed for the iPhone, as serious security and privacy risks come into play.

Privacy and security have always been at the forefront of Apple's approach, setting it apart from Android. However, the gap between the two is narrowing as Google strengthens its security and privacy measures, while Apple makes its own concessions.

The recent news from China adds another layer of complexity to the situation. According to local media, the surprise report that Apple was discussing a generative AI deal with China's Baidu has now been confirmed. The deal is done, and Chinese generative AI is coming to the iPhone, but only in China.

Baidu's AI model is approved by the Chinese government, with which the company has strong links. While there were rumors of military AI ties, they were denied. Nevertheless, this collaboration raises interesting questions for Apple, a company known for its privacy focus.

In China, the AI landscape is heavily regulated, and only government-approved models are allowed. While the main focus of these approvals is censorship and the prevention of dissent, surveillance, monitoring, and control are always part of the backdrop. Apple has been dealing with these challenges in China since its early days there, and its growth in the country has only exacerbated the situation.

AI presents a difficult path to navigate because it has the potential to rapidly expand its role on our smartphones and in our lives. Deciding whether to grant or deny access to our most sensitive information will continue to be a challenge. Baidu, like other Chinese tech companies, is subject to national security laws, which are often debated in relation to companies like ByteDance/TikTok and Huawei.

Initially, it was speculated that Apple's generative AI plans for iOS 18 would be on-device, ensuring privacy and security. This would align with its expanded end-to-end encryption and user controls. The idea was that what happens on the iPhone, stays on the iPhone. However, news of Apple's discussions with Google about Gemini changed everything.

From a privacy standpoint, Google's AI is primarily cloud-based, although it has some on-device functionality. The fact that Apple was considering incorporating this Google technology into its iPhone surprised many. It became one of the year's biggest tech talking points, at least until the Department of Justice intervened.

Despite their different approaches to AI, cloud, encryption, and privacy, an alliance between Apple and Google made commercial sense. Google is leading the way in generative AI and has made significant progress in applying it to smartphones, apps, and services. The exclusive iPhone search arrangement also paved the way for such a partnership. Time is of the essence.

This alignment between iPhone and Android is just the latest example of their growing similarities. Apple's mix and match approach, with Google Gemini in the cloud and its own AI on-device, mirrors Samsung's strategy. Samsung also seeks to balance AI features with user privacy and data security and has a similar Gemini/Baidu combination.

Samsung takes a hybrid approach, combining on-device and cloud-based AI to ensure seamless usability and give users greater control over their data. It aims to raise the standards of security and privacy in this new era of data-intensive mobile experiences. I assumed that Apple would have a more locked-down approach, with privacy considerations at the forefront. However, it seems that Apple is now in a similar position.

I reached out to Apple for further clarification on its AI plans, but have not received a response yet. As the landscape of AI continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how Apple navigates the challenges of privacy, security, and global partnerships. One thing is for certain, the iPhone's future is shaping up to be very different from what we imagined.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65aeed369be3a016e61b4a9a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 23:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/dma-first-formal-probes/,"Apple, Google and Meta face first formal investigations under EU's DMA","The European Union has recently announced a series of investigations into major tech companies, specifically Alphabet/Google, Apple, and Meta. These investigations are being conducted under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which aims to regulate and address competition concerns in the digital market.

Alphabet/Google is under scrutiny for its rules on steering in Google Play and its approach to self-preferencing in search results. Apple's rules on steering in the App Store and the design of choice screens for alternative web browsers are also being investigated. Additionally, Meta's ""pay or consent"" model, which involves obtaining user consent for cross-use of personal data, will be examined by the European Commission.

In total, five investigations have been launched, less than three weeks after the compliance deadline for these companies. The DMA allows for fines of up to 10% of global annual turnover for confirmed violations, with higher penalties for repeat offenses. The EU has up to 12 months to conclude the investigations, although the duration may vary.

These investigations by the European Union come as antitrust scrutiny on these tech companies increases not only in Europe but also in their home country, the United States. There has been criticism of the compliance plans presented by the companies, with concerns that they do not fully comply with the new EU law.

Google has been accused of bypassing the regulation's ban on self-preferencing by introducing new features in search results that unfairly compete with rivals. Apple's use of notifications to warn users of risks outside its ecosystem has been criticized, as well as Meta's ""pay or be tracked"" approach, which has been condemned as exploitative by privacy and consumer rights groups.

The European Commission has initiated proceedings to assess whether Alphabet and Apple are in breach of the DMA in relation to their app stores. The Commission is concerned that their measures may impose restrictions and limitations on developers, hindering their ability to freely communicate and promote offers. Additionally, the investigation will focus on Google's vertical search services and how they may impact rival services.

Regarding Apple, the EU will also examine whether the company is complying with user choice obligations on iOS, such as allowing easy uninstallation of apps, changing default settings, and providing effective choice screens for alternative services. The concern is that Apple's measures may prevent users from fully exercising their choice of services within the Apple ecosystem.

In the case of Meta, the investigation will evaluate whether its ""pay or consent"" model complies with the DMA. The EU is concerned that this binary choice may not provide a real alternative for users who do not consent, thus failing to prevent the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers.

During a press conference, the EU's internal market commissioner emphasized that the DMA requires gatekeepers to offer free, non-discriminatory alternatives to users. The investigations will determine whether the investigated companies are meeting these requirements.

Overall, these investigations highlight the European Union's commitment to regulating and ensuring fair competition in the digital market. The outcome of these probes will have significant implications for the tech industry and may lead to substantial fines or changes in business practices.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1031626648.jpg?resize=1200,799",2024-03-25 12:10:10,Innovation,Innovation
