Today's puzzle was quite tricky, but don't worry, I've got some hints and answers to help you out. But first, let's talk about how to play Strands.

Strands is a word search puzzle game, similar to the classic word search you might be familiar with. The New York Times' Strands puzzle is currently in beta, so it's important that enough people play it every day for it to stick around.

Each day, you'll be presented with a grid of letters, six by eight in size. Your goal is to find a group of words that have something in common. The theme of the words will be hinted at, and when you find a word that fits the theme, it will be highlighted in blue.

In addition to the theme words, there is a special word called a spangram that you'll need to find. The spangram connects two opposite sides of the grid. While the theme words will not be proper names, the spangram can be a proper name. When you find the spangram, it will be highlighted in yellow.

Now, let's move on to today's puzzle. The official theme hint for today is ""Sign language."" And here's an extra hint to help you out: ""Constellation.""

Okay, now it's time for the answers. But before I reveal them, I have to give you a spoiler alert. Only scroll down if you're ready to see the answers.

Today's spangram is ""ASTROLOGY."" Here's where you can find it on the grid:

Once you find the spangram, it should be easier to find the rest of the words. But I have to admit, I had some trouble with a couple of them. Here's the full list of answers:

- Bull
- Goat
- Scorpion
- Virgin
- Archer
- Scales
- Twins

[Insert screenshot of the grid with the answers highlighted]

Today's puzzle was quite tricky for me. I initially thought I was looking for animals because I found ""Bull"" and ""Goat,"" but that didn't make sense in the context of sign language. It wasn't until I stumbled upon ""OLOGY"" that things started to click. Eventually, I realized that all the words were actually constellations. I found ""Archer,"" ""Twins,"" and finally ""Scorpion,"" although that last one gave me a tough time.

On a side note, I recently watched the film Taxi Driver, and it was oddly timed because there's a scene where astrology signs are mentioned. What a coincidence!

Well, that's it for today's Strands puzzle. How did you do? Let me know on Twitter and Facebook. And don't forget to check out my blog for daily Wordle guides and more.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/24/meet-the-apps-that-tell-you-when-to-take-your-eclipse-glasses-off/,Meet The Apps That Tell You When To Take Your Eclipse Glasses Off,"When it comes to knowing when to remove your solar eclipse glasses, it can be a bit confusing. First, you have to make sure you're within the path of totality, which is only 115 miles wide. Secondly, you need to be in a place with a clear sky. And finally, you have to remove your glasses at just the right time to witness the sun's majestic corona.

While most people may not go through all these steps, it's that final one that tends to cause panic among those who are eager to witness an eclipse. But fear not, it's actually quite simple. You remove your eclipse glasses when it gets dark. That's it. If you're in the path of totality, darkness will quickly envelop you as the moon's shadow passes over. It's an awe-inspiring moment that you won't be able to miss. However, if you're not in the path of totality, it won't get dark, so you should continue to use your glasses.

Now, there are some smartphone apps available that provide an immersive audio experience and guide you on when to remove your solar eclipse glasses as totality begins. These apps also help you identify other phenomena like shadow bands, Baily's beads, and the diamond ring effect. They offer a narration that walks you through the entire process, making it a truly engaging experience. To make the most of these apps, it's recommended to use over-the-ear bone conduction earphones instead of traditional earbuds.

One such app is the ""Pro"" version of The Eclipse Company's app. This app offers real-time weather updates, cloud forecasts, a countdown timer with a vibration alert to safely remove your glasses, and detailed information about local eclipse events. It also alerts you when to look for specific eclipse phenomena, creating an immersive audio experience. However, it remains silent during totality.

Another great option is the Solar Eclipse Timer app. This app uses geolocation to confirm if you're within the path of totality and guides you through the contact times. It also provides information on various eclipse phenomena. Developed by eclipse chaser and educator Gordon Telepun, this app is particularly useful for photographers, as it includes a ""Photographer's Mode"" developed in collaboration with ex-NASA eclipse calculator and photographer Fred Espenak.

For iOS users, there is the One Eclipse app. This app, created by the non-profit organization Astronomers Without Borders and Simulation Curriculum, offers a unique feature - it supports an eclipse glasses recycling program for underserved communities worldwide. In addition to simulating the eclipse from your location or anywhere on Earth, the app provides an interactive map with precise eclipse event times and a dynamic Eclipse Countdown clock that includes a simple audio timer for each phase of the eclipse.

Remember, it's always a good idea to stay updated with the latest information on total solar eclipses, including travel and lodging options. So be sure to check for new articles regularly.

In conclusion, witnessing a total solar eclipse is an incredible experience. By following the simple instructions and utilizing helpful apps, you can make the most of this phenomenon. Just remember to remove your glasses when it gets dark, embrace the awe-inspiring moment, and enjoy the beauty of the sun's corona. Wishing you clear skies and wide eyes!","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65e701ccb41a29b8a2fd120f/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3094,1451,x0,y304,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 19:00:00,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have experienced significant growth in their respective industries, and there are several similarities between the two companies. Both businesses emerged from unexpected opportunities. AWS realized it could sell its internal services, such as storage and compute, which it had developed for its own use. Nvidia discovered that its gaming GPU was well-suited for processing AI workloads.

This realization led to explosive revenue growth for both companies. Nvidia's revenue skyrocketed from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024 to $22.1 billion in Q4 2024, although most of this growth came from its data center business. While AWS didn't experience the same level of growth, it has consistently been a major revenue driver for Amazon. However, Microsoft and Google have entered the market, and other chip makers are expected to gain market share in the future.

Both Nvidia and AWS were in the right place at the right time. The rise of web apps and mobile technology created a demand for cloud resources, and enterprises recognized the value of migrating workloads to the cloud. Similarly, the increased use of GPUs for AI and language processing coincided with the growth of these technologies.

AWS has become a highly profitable business, approaching a $100 billion run rate. However, its growth has started to slow down, while Nvidia's growth continues to accelerate. This is partly due to the law of large numbers, which will eventually impact Nvidia as well. The question is whether Nvidia can sustain its growth and become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS.

In terms of short-term financial outlook, Nvidia's revenue growth has been astronomical in recent quarters. The company expects $24 billion in revenue for its current quarter (Q1 FY25), representing a 234% growth compared to the previous year. However, as Nvidia's revenue ramps up, its growth rate is expected to decline. Analysts project around 8.6% growth from the final quarter of fiscal 2024 to the first quarter of fiscal 2025. While this is still impressive, it indicates a slowdown compared to previous periods.

Looking ahead, AI could continue to drive growth for Nvidia in the coming years, even as competition from AMD, Intel, and other chipmakers increases. Nvidia currently holds a significant market share, but competition will intensify in the future. However, the company is well-positioned to maintain its dominance. At the chip level, Nvidia is firmly in control, while AMD is gaining ground at the board level.

In conclusion, both Nvidia and AWS have experienced remarkable growth, driven by the demand for cloud services and the increasing use of GPUs for AI workloads. While AWS's growth has slowed down, Nvidia's revenue continues to surge. The future outlook for Nvidia remains positive, with expectations of ongoing growth, although at a slightly slower pace. As long as AI remains a significant market, Nvidia is likely to maintain its position as a key player in the industry.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/krisholt/2024/03/24/nyt-connections-hints-and-answers-for-monday-march-25/,"NYT ‘Connections’ Hints And Answers For Monday, March 25","Welcome to today's game of Connections! If you're ready to test your skills and have some fun, let's get started.

In Connections, you'll be presented with a grid of 16 words. Your task is to find the links between them and arrange them into four groups of four. These groups could be related to horror movie franchises, types of verbs, or even rappers.

Remember, each puzzle has only one solution, so you'll need to think carefully about the links between the words. If you're unsure, you can always shuffle the words to help you see the connections.

The groups are color coded for your convenience. The yellow group is usually the easiest to figure out, followed by the blue and green groups. The purple group is often the trickiest, as it involves wordplay. Keep that in mind as you solve the puzzle.

To play, select four words that you think belong together and press Submit. If your guess is incorrect, you'll lose a life. If you're close to the correct group, you may receive a message telling you that you're one word away, but you'll still need to figure out which word to swap.

Be careful not to make four mistakes, or it's game over. But don't worry, I'll provide some hints to help you along the way. And if you're really stuck, I'll even give you the answers.

Now, let's reveal today's 16 words:

- PACE
- CLIPPER
- MOVE
- MEDICINE
- FASTER
- PROMPTER
- ROCKET
- SPEED
- GO
- SPUR
- COMMUTE
- HURRY
- RATE
- VISION
- CLIP
- PACER

And here are the hints for today's groups:

Yellow group: something's swiftness
Green group: speed up!
Blue group: NBA team player
Purple group: linked by a term meaning ""over a long distance""

Now that you have the hints, take your time to think and make your guesses. Remember, there's no rush, and I'm here to help if you need it.

Ready for the answers? Here they are:

Yellow group: how fast something is going (CLIP, PACE, RATE, SPEED)
Green group: ""step on it!"" (FASTER, GO, HURRY, MOVE)
Blue group: NBA team player (CLIPPER, PACER, ROCKET, SPUR)
Purple group: tele____ (COMMUTE, MEDICINE, PROMPTER, VISION)

No perfect game today, but my streak is up to five games in a row. I quickly figured out the blues, although I suspected they might be a red herring. The greens and yellows were interesting, almost like noun and verb versions of the same idea. After a silly mistake with the greens, I corrected it and focused on the purples to secure the victory.

That's all for today's Connections clues and answers. If you need hints or the solution for tomorrow's game, be sure to check out my blog.

And here's a quick life tip for you: make it a point to eat at the best restaurant in your area at least once. Save up for it if you have to. Trust me, the experience will be worth it. While takeout is nice, there's something special about dining at the top-rated place nearby. It's likely to create a memorable experience.

Now, go out there and have a fantastic day!",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/64dbcee7d64da3663d88000e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 17:30:02,Innovation,Innovation
