While the main details of the new device, such as the choice of RAM and storage options, may seem familiar for high-end smartphones in 2024, it's the choice of chipset that is truly intriguing. Samsung has decided to incorporate a mix of Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 and its own Exynos 2400 chipset in the Galaxy Z Flip 6.

In the past, the Galaxy Z Flip 5 models all came with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset, while the Galaxy S23 family in 2023 exclusively used Snapdragon chipsets. However, with the Galaxy S24 now incorporating chips from both Qualcomm and Samsung's Exynos, it was only a matter of time before Samsung took a similar approach with its leading foldable phone.

The choice of chipset is significant because the Snapdragon and Exynos chipsets differ in terms of performance. The Snapdragon platform is widely regarded as more powerful compared to Samsung's own Exynos rival. While the performance gap is small, it is noticeable in head-to-head comparisons on the Galaxy S24 handsets. On the other hand, the Exynos family is more power efficient and offers better battery life.

Unfortunately, consumers will not have the option to choose their preferred chipset. Each sales region will receive either the Exynos or Snapdragon variant, but not both. Despite this limitation, the specifications of the two chipsets are now closer than ever before. Using Samsung's own Exynos 2400 chipset has the advantage of reducing the overall cost of materials, which is essential in a competitive market for foldable phones. Consumers comparing the Z Flip to similar designs from competitors like Oppo will likely consider price as a major factor.

While some consumers may prioritize having the most powerful phone possible, often opting for larger candy bar-styled phones, Samsung hopes that they will also consider the Galaxy S24 Ultra. However, for those who value both function and form, foldable phones are the modern choice. The slight performance loss associated with the Exynos chipset is outweighed by the more competitive price.

In conclusion, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is set to make a splash in the smartphone market with its unique combination of Qualcomm and Exynos chipsets. While the Snapdragon offers more power, the Exynos chipset is more power efficient and cost-effective. Samsung's decision to use its own chipset will provide consumers with a more competitive price point. As the market for foldable phones continues to grow, it will be interesting to see how the Galaxy Z Flip 6 performs against its competitors in terms of both performance and affordability.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-liquid-iron-battery-grid-energy.html,New all-liquid iron flow battery for grid energy storage,"A New Battery Design for Large-Scale Energy Storage

Researchers at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have developed a new battery design that repurposes a commonplace chemical used in water treatment facilities. This design offers a pathway to a safe, economical, water-based, flow battery made with Earth-abundant materials. The goal is to incorporate intermittent energy sources, such as wind and solar energy, into the nation's electric grid.

The researchers report in Nature Communications that their lab-scale, iron-based battery has exhibited remarkable cycling stability over one thousand consecutive charging cycles while maintaining 98.7% of its maximum capacity. This is a significant improvement compared to previous studies of similar iron-based batteries, which reported degradation of the charge capacity over fewer charging cycles.

Iron-based flow batteries have been around since the 1980s and are now commercially available. However, what makes this battery design different is the unique liquid chemical formula used to store energy. The battery combines charged iron with a neutral-pH phosphate-based liquid electrolyte called nitrogenous triphosphonate, or NTMPA. NTMPA is commercially available in industrial quantities because it is commonly used to inhibit corrosion in water treatment plants.

Flow batteries consist of two chambers filled with different liquids. They charge through an electrochemical reaction and store energy in chemical bonds. When connected to an external circuit, they release that energy to power electrical devices. Unlike conventional batteries, flow batteries feature two external supply tanks of liquid constantly circulating through them to supply the electrolyte, serving as the battery system's ""blood supply."" The size of the electrolyte supply tank determines the amount of energy the flow battery can store.

Flow batteries can serve as backup generators for the electric grid and are an essential part of a decarbonization strategy to store energy from renewable sources. One advantage of flow batteries is their scalability. They can be built at any scale, from lab-bench size to the size of a city block.

In the near term, grid operators are looking to locate battery energy storage systems (BESS) in urban or suburban areas near energy consumers. Safety concerns are often a challenge for city planners. However, the aqueous flow battery developed by the researchers could help alleviate those concerns. It operates in water at neutral pH, which is advantageous for safety. Additionally, the system uses commercially available reagents that haven't been previously investigated for use in flow batteries.

The research team has reported that their initial design can reach an energy density of up to 9 watt-hours per liter (Wh/L). While commercialized vanadium-based systems are more energy dense at 25 Wh/L, the advantage of the iron-based battery is that it can be scaled using Earth-abundant materials to provide the same energy output.

The development of flow batteries using Earth-abundant materials is crucial for modernizing the U.S. electric grid and integrating renewable energy sources. The design created by the researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory shows promise in terms of cycling stability and compatibility with existing infrastructure. As further advancements are made, flow batteries could play a significant role in achieving a sustainable and reliable energy future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/new-all-liquid-iron-fl.jpg,2024-03-25 07:22:25,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2024/03/25/apple-secretly-engineering-iphone-for-game-changing-update-to-apple-pay-report-claims/,"Apple Secretly Engineering iPhone For Game-Changing Update, Report Claims","One of the recent developments in the Department of Justice's lawsuit against Apple involves the NFC chip in the iPhone. This particular chip powers Apple Pay and has been strictly limited to use by Apple alone, citing security and privacy concerns. However, it seems that this may soon change, as Apple is reportedly making preparations for opening up access to the chip.

According to Mark Gurman of Bloomberg, who shared this information in his Power On newsletter, the system has already undergone changes in the European Union and could soon follow suit in the United States. The NFC chip is responsible for the quick and effortless payment experience provided by Apple Pay, allowing users to simply tap their phone on a card reader to complete transactions. Apple's protection of this chip has been motivated by the need to safeguard user finances from potential threats.

It's worth noting that by maintaining exclusive control over the NFC chip, Apple also protects the royalties it charges for each transaction made through Apple Pay. If third-party financial companies were allowed access to the chip, they could impose their own royalty fees, effectively cutting Apple out of the equation. As Gurman reported nearly two years ago, major players like PayPal, Square, Chase, Citi, and American Express have been restricted in their ability to launch tap-to-pay iPhone apps with their own unique features and interfaces. Additionally, to tap into the iPhone user base, these companies have to pay a fee of up to 0.15% for every Apple Pay credit card transaction. It has been estimated that Apple Pay generates over $1 billion per year in fees alone.

Considering the financial, safety, and security implications, it becomes clear why Apple has been reluctant to open up access to the NFC chip. However, when the European Union introduced the Digital Markets Act earlier this year, it included a condition that required Apple to provide access to the chip. Despite initial concerns surrounding security, Apple eventually agreed to comply.

Behind the scenes, it appears that Apple is preparing for the possibility of similar requirements being implemented elsewhere. As Gurman states, ""Apple has already opened up NFC access in Europe, and I am told that engineering work to do so in the US is already underway."" This suggests that Apple is taking steps to ensure it is ready, even if it hopes to avoid the need for such changes altogether. While there is no specific timeline provided, if the process proceeds smoothly in the EU, Apple will likely work to ensure a similar transition takes place in the US in the coming months or years.

In conclusion, Apple's exclusive control over the NFC chip in its iPhones, primarily for security reasons, may soon be changing. The company has already made concessions in the European Union, and engineering work is reportedly underway to extend access to the chip in the US. This potential shift could have significant implications for the future of mobile payment systems and the financial landscape as a whole. As always, Apple will prioritize maintaining the security and trustworthiness of its payment platform while adapting to evolving regulations and consumer expectations.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6601869f70d828f8cfe50372/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3662,2060,x0,y591,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 10:15:49,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-deep-geothermal-renewable-powerhouse.html,Dig deep: US bets on geothermal to become renewable powerhouse,"Geothermal energy has the potential to become a major player in the transition to green energy, despite currently only accounting for a small fraction of US energy production. Both businesses and the Biden administration are investing in technological advancements to harness the clean and reliable power that lies beneath our feet. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm believes that geothermal energy could surpass hydroelectric and solar power in the US by 2050.

Geothermal energy utilizes the naturally high temperatures found underground to generate electricity and heat buildings. In 2022, it made up just 1.6 percent of US energy consumption. To increase production, the US government has invested over $200 million in an experimental site in Utah. This site focuses on Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), which involve drilling exceptionally deep wells and injecting water into hot rocks to generate power. This approach reduces upfront risks and eliminates the need for nearby hot springs or reservoirs.

The US government is also streamlining the process for companies to convert permits for oil or gas exploration into geothermal licenses. This reduces paperwork and delays, making geothermal projects more attractive to investors. Moreover, EGS requires fewer chemical additives compared to traditional fracking methods, making it more environmentally friendly. Geothermal drilling does not release hydrocarbons and provides a steady flow of energy, regardless of the weather or time of day.

Cost is another important factor. The US government estimates that the cost of geothermal energy will drop from $70 to $100 per megawatt hour (MWh) to $45 by 2035. Utilizing existing drilling technology makes geothermal development quicker and cheaper. The US has been at the forefront of this technology, with other countries, such as France, still in the experimental phase.

However, there are potential risks associated with geothermal drilling, including induced seismic activity. France abandoned a deep-drilling project in 2020 due to several tremors. The US Energy Department has implemented a mitigation protocol to address induced seismicity and is funding research on the issue. So far, no community has experienced seismic activity near a DOE-funded geothermal project.

Despite these risks, several US and Canadian start-ups are entering the geothermal market and have received significant investments. For example, Fervo Energy, in collaboration with Google, has connected its Nevada site to the electric grid. Demand for geothermal energy is also growing, with companies like Google, Microsoft, and Nucor committing to purchasing geothermal energy. The willingness of these major firms to pay a premium for geothermal energy is attracting further interest from the private sector.

While the geothermal sector is still small, experts believe that once a successful commercial facility is established, others will follow suit. The focus now is on growing the sector responsibly. Geothermal energy has the potential to become a key pillar of the green transition, providing clean and reliable power to various industries and households. With continued investment and advancements in technology, geothermal energy could play a significant role in the future of sustainable energy production.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/a-worker-operates-a-dr.jpg,2024-03-25 04:59:03,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-large-language-simple-mechanism-knowledge.html,Large language models use a surprisingly simple mechanism to retrieve some stored knowledge,"Large language models (LLMs) are widely used in various fields, but their inner workings remain a mystery to scientists. In an attempt to shed light on this complexity, researchers from MIT and other institutions investigated how these models retrieve stored knowledge. Their surprising discovery was that LLMs often utilize a simple linear function to decode and recover facts. These linear equations, which involve two variables and no exponents, establish a direct relationship between the variables.

By identifying linear functions for different types of facts, the researchers were able to probe the model and locate where new subject knowledge is stored. They also developed a technique to estimate these functions. Interestingly, even when a model provides an incorrect answer, it often retains the correct information. This finding opens the possibility of using this approach to identify and rectify falsehoods within the model, reducing the occurrence of incorrect or nonsensical responses.

The lead authors of the research paper, Evan Hernandez and Arnab Sharma, collaborated with their advisors and other experts from MIT, Northeastern University, Harvard University, and the Israeli Institute of Technology. The paper detailing their findings will be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024) in Vienna.

Most large language models, known as transformer models, are neural networks composed of interconnected nodes or neurons. These models process and encode data across multiple layers, storing knowledge as relations connecting different subjects and objects. For example, the relation ""Miles Davis plays the trumpet"" connects the subject (Miles Davis) to the object (trumpet). When prompted with a query related to a specific subject, the model must decode the most relevant fact to provide an accurate response.

The researchers conducted a series of experiments to investigate LLMs. Despite their complexity, they discovered that these models decode relational information using simple linear functions. Each function is tailored to a specific type of fact. For instance, the transformer uses one decoding function to output the instrument a person plays and a different function to output the state in which a person was born.

To estimate these simple functions, the researchers developed a method and computed functions for 47 different relations, such as ""capital city of a country"" and ""lead singer of a band."" Although there are countless possible relations, the chosen subset represents the types of facts that can be expressed in this manner.

The researchers tested each function by modifying the subject and observing if the correct object information could still be retrieved. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the linear decoding process for the selected relations. However, there were some relations that could not be adequately decoded using linear functions, indicating the involvement of non-linear processes.

The discovery of these simple mechanisms working within complex language models provides valuable insights into their inner workings. Understanding how these models store and retrieve information can lead to improvements in their performance and accuracy. Additionally, the ability to identify and correct falsehoods within the model can enhance the reliability of large language models and reduce the occurrence of incorrect responses.

In conclusion, large language models utilize linear functions to decode and recover stored facts. By studying these functions, researchers have gained insights into the inner workings of these complex models. This understanding opens up possibilities for improving their performance, correcting falsehoods, and ensuring more accurate responses. The research presented in this paper contributes to the ongoing efforts to unravel the mysteries of large language models and harness their potential more effectively.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/large-language-models-2.jpg,2024-03-25 09:34:06,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/fisker-nissan-deal-dead-funding-bankruptcy/,"Fisker loses potential Nissan deal, putting rescue funds at risk","The negotiations between Fisker and a large automaker, which has been rumored to be Nissan, have come to an end. This termination puts the near-term rescue funding effort of Fisker in danger. Fisker made this announcement in a regulatory filing on Monday morning, revealing that the negotiations were terminated on March 22. However, the company did not provide an explanation for this decision. It is worth mentioning that Fisker had to keep the negotiations going as part of the closing conditions for a potential $150 million convertible note that was announced last week. In light of this, Fisker stated in the filing that it will ask the unnamed investor to waive the closing condition.

Following this news, the startup's stock plummeted by 28%, leading to trading being halted. This is just the latest in a series of troubling signs for the struggling EV startup. Fisker has faced difficulties in selling its Ocean SUV, falling short of its own sales goals. This has forced the company to shift away from its direct sales model. Additionally, there have been numerous quality issues with the cars that have been delivered, which Fisker has struggled to address.

In February, Fisker laid off around 200 employees, which accounted for 15% of its staff. The company also reported having only $121 million in its bank account last week. With production currently on hold, Fisker has warned investors that it will not survive the year without a fresh injection of funds. While Fisker had engaged in talks with other automakers, such as Mazda, only Nissan had remained at the negotiation table until now.

These alternatives include ""in or out of court restructurings, capital markets transactions (subject to market conditions), repurchases, redemptions, exchanges or other refinancings of its existing debt, the potential issuance of equity securities, the potential sale of assets and businesses and/or other strategic transactions and/or other measures.""

It is clear that Fisker is facing significant challenges and is in desperate need of financial support. The termination of negotiations with a large automaker puts the company's near-term future at risk. However, Fisker is actively exploring other options to secure the funding it requires and is considering various strategies to navigate its current situation. The coming days and weeks will be crucial for Fisker as it seeks a lifeline to sustain its operations and pursue its goals in the electric vehicle market.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1236611991.jpg?resize=1200,759",2024-03-25 13:52:11,Innovation,Innovation
https://venturebeat.com/ai/companies-are-about-to-waste-billions-on-ai-heres-how-not-to-become-one-of-them/,Companies are about to waste billions on AI - here's how not to become one of them,"Join us in Boston on March 27 for an exclusive networking event focused on data integrity. Connect with leaders in the Gen AI enterprise and gain valuable insights and engage in meaningful conversations. Request an invite to secure your spot.

When it comes to new technologies, the hype cycle often clouds our judgment. Venture capitalists, in particular, feel the pressure to invest their raised capital and fear missing out on the next big thing. This mindset also permeates many companies, especially when it comes to AI and its associated technologies. Everything from large language models to machine learning is now considered AI, and companies are willing to invest in anything labeled as such.

However, this indiscriminate approach will inevitably lead to wasted resources. Billions of dollars will be spent on AI in the next decade, but not all of it will result in transformative outcomes. While technologies like search, social media, and mobile have had a lasting impact, others like virtual reality and crypto have fallen short of expectations.

Five years ago, the headlines were filled with promises of how AI would change everything. And now, everyone is rushing to demonstrate their investment in AI. This shotgun approach to investing leads to a few successes but many failures. Companies, driven by the fear of missing out, greenlight AI projects that are often based on misplaced hope rather than sound strategy.

Nevertheless, large language models (LLMs) are undeniably game-changing. Just look at the rapid adoption of ChatGPT, which quickly reached 100 million users. Almost every enterprise company is leveraging LLMs and AI in some capacity. The question then becomes, how can you determine where to invest and increase your chances of success?

Here are three key considerations that will help you make informed decisions and eliminate wasteful spending:

1. Understand the total cost over time: Before committing to an AI project, assess the resources required to sustain it. Often, the work of a data science team translates to five times the effort from engineering, DevOps, QA, product, and SysOps teams. Many companies have abandoned projects that initially seemed promising but lacked ongoing investment. Saying no to an AI initiative is difficult, but saying yes without proper funding jeopardizes future support for more worthwhile endeavors.

Additionally, consider the increasing marginal cost associated with AI. Training, running, and maintaining large models can be expensive. Overusing AI without generating significant downstream value eats into your margins. Moreover, retracting promised functionality can lead to customer dissatisfaction and damage your reputation. Just look at how Google's missteps affected its standing as an AI leader, or recall the early days of IBM's Watson.

2. Ask why you are uniquely positioned to do this: The tech industry can be divided into monopolies and commodities. If your AI initiative commoditizes over time, it becomes less enjoyable, especially if you lack the scale and cost advantages. Instead, focus on areas where you have a defensive moat. This could be preferential access to data, proprietary insights into a specific use case, or an application with strong network effects where you already have a head start.

3. Make strategic bets and follow through: Sometimes, the best bets are the ones that enhance your existing business. As the BASF commercial famously said, ""We don't make the things you buy, we make the things you buy better."" If applying AI can improve your current products or services, it provides valuable momentum. Investing in areas that align with your core business and have a clear path to implementation is a prudent strategy.

In conclusion, while the hype surrounding AI is warranted, it is crucial to approach investments in this technology with a clear and strategic mindset. Understanding the total cost over time, identifying your unique position in the market, and making well-thought-out bets will significantly increase your chances of success. Don't get swept away by the AI frenzy; instead, focus on maximizing the value AI can bring to your organization.",https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/An_AI_sitting_in_a_corner_curled_up_looking_sa-transformed.jpeg?w=1200&strip=all,2024-03-24 18:00:00,Innovation,Innovation

And now, players will have the opportunity to try it out for themselves with a free demo.

Game director Hyung Tae Kim recently announced the upcoming release of a demo for Stellar Blade on the PlayStation Blog. The demo will be available on March 29 at 7 AM PDT for PS5 players. Kim provides some details about the content of the demo, stating:

""The demo begins at the start of the game when Eve, a member of the 7th Airborne Squad, is sent to Earth on a mission to reclaim the planet from the Naytiba. Players will have the chance to engage in the first boss fight and get a taste of the gameplay mechanics that will be crucial throughout the game's story. Additionally, the demo includes a tutorial phase to help players familiarize themselves with the basic combat features as they explore the post-war Eidos 7, a human city now infested by the Naytiba.""

Kim also teases a surprise for players who complete the first stage of the game. Importantly, progress made in the demo will carry over to the full game's release on April 26, allowing players to pick up where they left off. However, it is advised to keep the PS5 save data in case the demo is uninstalled after playing.

Stellar Blade has chosen an opportune time to launch in April, as it is set to be one of the most highly anticipated releases of the month. While Hellblade 2 on Xbox in May may be its closest competitor in terms of profile, the game will likely stand out on its own. Additionally, Sea of Thieves will make its debut on PS5 on April 30, but it is unlikely to directly compete with Stellar Blade.

The game has sparked numerous discussions online due to its protagonist's physics-based movements, which have become a topic of debate in the ongoing cultural conversation about the portrayal of female characters in video games. While the design may harken back to an earlier era, the gameplay itself appears to be fast-paced and exhilarating. It is commendable that the developers have enough confidence in the game to release a free demo, as this is a rarity in the current gaming landscape.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/gostudent-tutoring-profitability/,"GoStudent, the online learning platform, says it's now profitable","GoStudent, the online tutoring marketplace based in Vienna, Austria, has become one of the leading startups in the international tech scene. With 11 million families and 23,000 tutors on its platform, GoStudent has now achieved profitability. CEO Felix Ohswald stated that the company is not just EBITDA profitable, but also has positive operating cashflow. This success comes after a challenging period for GoStudent, as the online learning market experienced a crash and customer demand sharply dropped off. The company lost â‚¬89 million in 2021 and â‚¬220 million in 2022, leading to layoffs and cost cuts.

Despite these setbacks, GoStudent managed to scale its core business model to over â‚¬100 million in revenue between 2019 and 2022. However, the company also had a cash burn of over â‚¬150 million in 2022 alone. Realizing that this path was unsustainable, GoStudent made significant changes to its operations. In 2023, the company reduced its burn rate by 70%, but further adjustments were necessary. The company underwent multiple rounds of layoffs and made strategic decisions to cut costs, such as eliminating lavish parties, pausing acquisitions, and refraining from expanding into new markets where online tutoring was not established.

GoStudent's growth was fueled by the digital transformation brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. The company transitioned from having to convince parents about the benefits of online tutoring to becoming a go-to solution for students in need of educational assistance. However, despite this success, GoStudent needed to address its cash burn and focus on achieving profitability. As a result, the company decided to refocus on Europe, rather than aiming to be present in 20 countries. It will adopt a more organic growth strategy outside of German-speaking countries. This shift is reflected in GoStudent's leadership, with the former chief growth officer being replaced by a chief marketing officer, signaling a focus on bottom-line growth.

Although GoStudent's mission is to build the number one global school and unlock the potential of every student through personalized tutoring, the company is currently focused on tutoring rather than teaching. However, its acquisition of StudienKreis in 2022 indicates a shift toward hybrid learning. StudienKreis, founded in 1974, has 1,000 physical learning centers mainly in Germany, which GoStudent is now utilizing to enhance its hybrid learning approach. GoStudent believes that the future of education is hybrid and aims to leverage technology to connect students with the right tutors regardless of location. Most of GoStudent's tutors are university students, making it easier for them to connect with students while providing personalized tutoring services.

GoStudent's journey to profitability has been challenging, but the company has made significant changes to ensure its long-term success. By focusing on organic growth, reducing costs, and embracing hybrid learning, GoStudent aims to continue its mission of providing personalized tutoring to students worldwide.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Founders-of-GoStudent-Gregor-Muller-I-Felix-Ohswald-2.jpg?w=1024,2024-03-25 11:00:36,Innovation,Innovation
