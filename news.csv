Attending a total solar eclipse requires careful planning and preparation. First, you must position yourself within the narrow path of totality, which is only 115 miles wide. Secondly, you need to ensure that you have clear skies overhead. Lastly, you must know precisely when to remove your eclipse glasses in order to witness the sun's magnificent corona.

While these steps may seem daunting, it is the final one that often causes anxiety among eclipse enthusiasts. The truth is, removing your eclipse glasses is quite simple. You do so when it becomes dark. If you are fortunate enough to be in the path of totality, darkness will descend rapidly as the moon's shadow envelops you. This moment is unmistakable and impossible to miss. Conversely, if you are not within the path of totality, darkness will not occur, and you must continue using your eclipse glasses.

Fortunately, there are now smartphone apps available that can enhance your eclipse experience. These apps offer an immersive audio guide that not only instructs you when to remove your glasses during totality but also provides insights into various eclipse phenomena. For instance, you can learn about shadow bands, which are wavy lines on the ground caused by Earth's turbulent atmosphere when the sun is a tiny crescent. Additionally, the apps educate you about Baily's beads, the last few drops of sunlight, and the diamond ring effect, which resembles a jewel as the corona emerges like a halo.

To make the most of these apps, it is recommended to use them with earphones. However, instead of opting for earbuds that isolate you from your surroundings, consider using over-the-ear bone conduction earphones. These types of earphones allow you to listen to the audio instructions while still being aware of your surroundings.

Let's take a closer look at some of the top solar eclipse apps available:

1. The Eclipse Company (Platforms: iOS and Android)
The Pro version of The Eclipse Company's app offers users real-time weather updates and cloud forecasts for totality. It also includes a countdown timer with a vibration alert to safely remove your eclipse glasses. Additionally, the app provides detailed information about local eclipse events. During totality, the app remains silent, allowing you to fully immerse yourself in the experience.

2. Solar Eclipse Timer App (Platforms: iOS and Android)
For a cost of $1.99 per eclipse, the Solar Eclipse Timer app uses geolocation to confirm whether you are within the path of totality. It then guides you through the various contact times. This app is especially useful for photographers, as it includes a ""Photographer's Mode"" developed in collaboration with ex-NASA eclipse calculator and photographer Fred Espenak.

3. One Eclipse (Platforms: iOS)
Created by the non-profit organization Astronomers Without Borders and Simulation Curriculum, the OneEclipse app supports a recycling program for eclipse glasses in underserved communities worldwide. In addition to allowing users to simulate the eclipse from their specific location or any place on Earth, the app features an interactive map with precise eclipse event times. It also includes a dynamic Eclipse Countdown clock with a simple audio timer for all stages of the eclipse.

These apps not only enhance your eclipse-viewing experience but also contribute to a greater understanding and appreciation of this astronomical phenomenon. By using them, you can ensure that you don't miss any important moments during the eclipse and gain valuable insights into the various phenomena associated with it.

In conclusion, knowing when to remove solar eclipse glasses is a crucial aspect of witnessing this awe-inspiring event. By following the simple guideline of removing your glasses when darkness falls, you can fully experience the beauty of the sun's corona during totality. Additionally, smartphone apps now offer immersive audio experiences that provide guidance and information about various eclipse phenomena. So, make the most of these technological advancements and prepare yourself for an unforgettable solar eclipse experience. Remember, clear skies and open eyes are all you need.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65e701ccb41a29b8a2fd120f/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3094,1451,x0,y304,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 19:00:00,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/24/samsung-s24-ultra-s23-free-update-warning-for-galaxy-android-users/,Samsung Issues Critical Update For Millions Of Galaxy Users,"Samsung Galaxy users, listen up! There's a critical update you need to check for and install as soon as it's available. Trust us, you don't want to miss this one.

Samsung has been rolling out its March security update, starting with premium devices and now including budget models. Just recently, carrier-unlocked S21 FE devices in the US joined the update club. Over the past couple of weeks, various versions of S24s, S23s, and S22s received the update before the older and budget variants. It's crucial that you download and install this new software as soon as it becomes available for your network and model.

To find out if your device is eligible for the monthly update, you can check here.

Now, let's talk about the update itself. Among the numerous fixes and improvements for Android and Samsung, there are two high-risk vulnerabilities that have been patched. These vulnerabilities could potentially allow malware to take control of some or all of your device. So, it's essential to stay updated to ensure your device's security.

But the update itself isn't the biggest news of the week. Samsung has finally embraced Google's seamless update approach after years of avoiding it. Instead of the traditional download, install, and reboot cycle for updates, the new system downloads and installs updates in the background to a secondary partition on the device. It then reboots from that partition when you restart your device.

Once the reboot is complete, the secondary partition becomes primary, and the other partition waits for the next update. This significantly reduces the downtime during which your device is unusable, with most of the process happening in the background. This approach, known as A/B system updates or seamless updates, ensures that your device remains functional even during OTA updates. It also reduces the need for device replacements and reflashes at repair and warranty centers.

You can easily identify when a seamless update is being installed by looking at the two progress bars—one for the download/install and the other for verification. The Galaxy A55 has been the testing ground for Samsung's initial seamless update implementation, but we can expect it to roll out to more devices in the coming months. We're eagerly waiting to see which devices will be next.

It's yet to be seen if this seamless update approach will be extended to all Samsung models. As we've come to expect from Samsung updates, they can be complex, and we often need to consult checklists to understand what, when, and for how long. However, the introduction of seamless updates may have been prompted by recent changes in the Android Open Source Project, which suggested removing the legacy alternative to seamless updates after eight years of running in parallel.

While seamless updates may shorten the update process to just a minute or two of reboot time, it won't necessarily simplify the monthly update combination of Samsung and Android across their diverse range of devices. However, it does eliminate the need for user action. Updates will now happen in the background, without requiring user initiation. To avoid disrupting users, it is recommended to schedule updates during idle maintenance mode, such as overnight and on Wi-Fi.

Of course, this is still a far cry from Apple's streamlined update process. But as iPhone and Android continue to evolve and converge, we may see them get a little closer in the future.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65b9d23fb7b46f6467a28780/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2366,1280,x313,y135,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 22:00:00,Innovation,Innovation

America is currently experiencing a golden age of eclipses, and this week's celestial event is a prelude to the big one happening next week. In the early hours of Monday, March 25, the full worm moon will be partially eclipsed by Earth, creating a slight penumbral lunar eclipse. Although not a full ""blood moon"" total lunar eclipse, this event is crucial because it sets the stage for a total solar eclipse on Monday, April 8, 2024. If you don't want to miss out on this incredible spectacle, here are some planning tips for you.

Aside from the lunar eclipse, there are other exciting things happening in the night sky this week. As the waning gibbous moon rises later and later at night, the early evening skies become perfect for stargazing by the weekend. You can also catch a glimpse of the moon passing close to a couple of bright stars. 

Let's dive deeper into what you can expect this week:

Monday, March 25: 'Worm Moon Lunar Eclipse'

On Monday, March 25, the ""Worm Moon,"" also known as the ""Crow Moon"" and the ""Lenten Moon,"" will pass through Earth's outer shadow in space. This will result in a slight penumbral lunar eclipse visible from the night side of Earth, including North and South America, Europe, East Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. In New York, the eclipse will begin at 00:53 a.m. EDT and end at 05:32 a.m. EDT, with the maximum eclipse occurring at 03:12 a.m. EDT. In Los Angeles, the eclipse will start at 9:53 p.m. PDT and end at 02:32 a.m. PDT, with the maximum eclipse at 00:12 a.m. EDT.

Tuesday, March 26: Moon and Spica

A few hours after sunset on Tuesday, March 26, go outside and witness the almost full moon rising due east. This moonrise will be special because just to the top right of the rising moon, you'll spot the bright star Spica. Spica is the brightest star in the constellation Virgo and one of the 20 brightest stars in the night sky. It will be within 1.4 degrees of our natural satellite, creating a beautiful sight.

Saturday, March 30: Moon and Antares

If you find yourself awake late on Friday night or in the early hours of Saturday, look to the southeast. You'll be treated to the sight of a 78%-lit waning gibbous moon located less than a degree from Antares, a red supergiant star in the constellation Scorpius. This stunning celestial pairing is worth staying up for.

Galaxies of the Week: Bode's and the Cigar

This week, Ursa Minor and Ursa Major, both visible in the northern sky after dark, will showcase two remarkable galaxies through an 8-inch telescope. M81, also known as Bode's galaxy, is a large spiral galaxy located approximately 12 million light-years away from Earth. It stands out as one of the brightest galaxies in the night sky. On the other hand, M82, or the Cigar galaxy, is a starburst galaxy situated about 12 million light-years from Earth. It is renowned for its high rate of star formation. When viewed through a telescope, its stars can be observed as small, diffuse patches of light northwest of the bright star Dubhe in the Big Dipper.

Eclipse Tip of the Week: Preparing for the Total Solar Eclipse

In less than two weeks, North America will experience a rare and breathtaking event—a total solar eclipse. If you haven't made plans yet, now is the time to act. Remember that you must be in the path of totality (the yellow stripe on the map) to fully experience the eclipse. Simply being close to it won't make any practical difference. To find out where to stay and where to witness this extraordinary event, check out the plethora of articles available or visit websites that provide maps, simulations, and events listings. 

To ensure you have the most accurate information for your location, consult online planetariums like Stellarium and The Sky Live. Check planet-rise/planet-set, sunrise/sunset, and moonrise/moonset times for your specific area.

We hope you have clear skies and wide eyes to fully enjoy the wonders of the cosmos this week.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/5fb7fc7c1bbcea1ee676a031/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2390,1121,x1617,y1192,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 20:15:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/non-sexy-industries-can-appeal-to-investors-too/,Non-sexy industries can appeal to investors too,"Welcome to TechCrunch Fintech! In this edition, we will be focusing on some exciting fintech startups in Africa, exploring how Copilot has benefited from Mint's closure, and discussing why venture capitalists have shown increased interest in a specific expense management startup. 

Africa's fintech ecosystem has experienced a decline in venture funding recently, mirroring global trends. However, this past week has been a positive one for the region. Uber led a $100 million investment into African mobility fintech Moove, boosting the startup's valuation to $750 million. Additionally, Zone raised $8.5 million to expand its decentralized payment infrastructure. Tanzanian payments company Nala successfully pivoted to offer remittance services, leading to the development of a B2B payment platform.

Intuit's decision to discontinue budgeting app Mint has created an opportunity for startups in the same space. Copilot, in particular, has experienced significant growth in the last four months, surpassing its growth in the previous four years. This growth enabled the startup to secure a $6 million Series A funding round, led by Nico Wittenborn's Adjacent. Mint's loss has proven to be Copilot's gain, as it attracted users seeking an alternative.

Expense management startup Coast has achieved remarkable revenue growth, with a 550% increase last year. The company focuses on managing businesses with field personnel and fleets. It recently secured $25 million in equity funding. 

Digital bank Onyx Private has decided to pivot towards B2B services. Initially targeting high-earning millennials and Gen Zers, the YC-backed startup recently announced the termination of its banking operations and closure of customer accounts.

Swiss fintech nsave has raised $4 million in seed funding. The company aims to provide banking services in Switzerland to individuals in countries with unstable banking sectors or facing high inflation.

Despite the impressive growth of the fintech industry, Ramp's co-founder and CEO, Eric Glyman, believes that the potential market share has only been scratched. Glyman states that his unicorn corporate card and expense startup has tapped into only 1% of its full potential. It is worth mentioning that both Ramp and Deel celebrated their fifth anniversaries this week.

The U.S. Justice Department's antitrust complaint against Apple and its iPhone business specifically targets the company's significant financial operations.

In other news, Bolt and Checkout.com have formed a partnership to enable frictionless commerce. Rewards startup Fetch has raised $50 million from Morgan Stanley, taking advantage of the private credit boom. Wealthfront has postponed its IPO plans, and Affirm Holdings director Keith Rabois has sold shares worth over $318,000. Cloud banking tech provider nCino has acquired DocFox, Marco has raised $12 million to support LatAm trade finance, and PayPal-backed NX Technologies has raised $24 million to streamline automotive payments. Prizepool has received a cease-and-desist order from the FDIC for false and misleading statements, and DLocal has appointed Pedro Arnt as CEO while Sebastián Kanovich steps back. OMERS Ventures has welcomed Ryan Zauk as a fintech investor. Lastly, Klarna is challenging Visa and Mastercard with its open banking push.
