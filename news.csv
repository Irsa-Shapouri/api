https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-vulnerability-virtual-reality.html,Vulnerability in virtual reality systems identified,"Virtual reality (VR) systems have revolutionized the way we interact with digital content, offering immersive experiences that transport users to virtual worlds. However, a team of computer scientists at the University of Chicago has recently uncovered a potential vulnerability in VR systems that could pose a significant risk to users' privacy and security. The team has dubbed this vulnerability ""inception attacks,"" referring to the concept of inserting a layer of deception between the user's VR home screen and their VR User/Server.

In this scenario, hackers could exploit this vulnerability by adding an app to a user's VR headset, tricking them into engaging in actions that might inadvertently reveal sensitive information. The researchers have outlined their findings in a paper published on the arXiv preprint server, shedding light on the potential risks associated with this type of attack.

The concept behind the inception layer app is to introduce an additional layer of simulation between the user and the virtual world they perceive through their VR device. Drawing inspiration from the movie ""Inception,"" where characters experience a manipulated layer of reality, the researchers propose that hackers could use this layer to record sensitive information, intercept and modify data, or even manipulate the user's perception of the virtual world.

For example, an attacker could record a passcode entered into a virtual ATM, intercept and modify payment details, or even create virtual representations of trusted individuals to gain the user's trust and extract confidential information. The possibilities are vast, as the inception layer could monitor and manipulate gestures, voice commands, browsing activity, and social or business interactions.

The researchers conducted an experiment to test the feasibility of this type of attack. They enlisted the help of 28 volunteers who played a game using a demonstration VR headset. The researchers then simulated a hacking scenario by downloading an app onto the devices without the users' knowledge. Surprisingly, only 10 of the volunteers noticed a slight flickering during the download and activation process. Only one volunteer questioned the legitimacy of the activity, highlighting the potential stealthiness of such attacks.

Upon discovering these vulnerabilities, the research team promptly notified Meta, the company behind the Meta Quest VR system used in the experiment. Meta has expressed its intention to investigate the issue and address any confirmed vulnerabilities. It is crucial to acknowledge that these vulnerabilities are not limited to a specific VR system but are likely to exist across various platforms and applications that introduce additional layers between users and their VR experiences.

This research serves as a wake-up call for the VR industry, urging developers and manufacturers to prioritize user security and privacy. As VR technology continues to evolve and gain wider adoption, it is essential to ensure that robust security measures are in place to protect users from potential threats. VR has the potential to revolutionize various sectors, including gaming, education, healthcare, and more. However, these advancements must be accompanied by stringent security protocols to safeguard user trust and confidence.

In conclusion, the discovery of inception attacks in VR systems highlights the need for increased vigilance and proactive measures to counter potential threats. The researchers' findings shed light on the vulnerabilities that exist in VR systems, emphasizing the importance of continuous research and development in this field. As VR technology becomes more pervasive in our daily lives, it is crucial to prioritize user safety and security to fully realize the potential of this exciting technology.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/vulnerability-in-virtu.jpg,2024-03-25 10:20:02,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2024/03/25/apple-secretly-engineering-iphone-for-game-changing-update-to-apple-pay-report-claims/,"Apple Secretly Engineering iPhone For Game-Changing Update, Report Claims","The Department of Justice recently filed a lawsuit against Apple, and one of the key issues at hand is the NFC chip in the iPhone. This chip is responsible for powering Apple Pay, the company's mobile payment system, and Apple has been reluctant to allow outside firms to access it due to security and privacy concerns. However, it seems that this may soon change, as Apple is reportedly secretly preparing for it.

According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, who shared this information in his Power On newsletter, the NFC chip's accessibility, which has already been altered in the EU, could potentially change in the United States as well. The NFC chip is what enables users to make quick and effortless payments by simply tapping their phones on a card reader. Apple has always prioritized the security and trustworthiness of Apple Pay, as it ensures that bad actors cannot gain access to users' money.

It's worth noting that by keeping the NFC chip locked, Apple also protects the royalties it charges on each transaction. If a third-party finance company were given access to the chip, it could potentially charge its own royalty, leaving Apple out of the equation. Gurman had previously reported on this issue almost two years ago, stating that ""Apple’s policy means PayPal and Square—as well as financial institutions like Chase, Citi, and American Express—can't launch tap-to-pay iPhone apps with their own features and interface. It also means if they want to access the iPhone user base, they must pay an up-to-0.15% fee for every Apple Pay credit card transaction."" Estimates suggest that Apple Pay brings in over $1 billion per year in fees.

For various reasons, including financial, safety, and security concerns, it's understandable why Apple has been hesitant to open up the NFC chip. However, when the European Union introduced the Digital Markets Act earlier this year, one of the conditions was that Apple should provide access to the NFC chip. Although Apple was initially cautious due to security issues, it ultimately agreed to comply.

Behind the scenes, it seems that Apple is making preparations in case it is compelled to introduce similar changes elsewhere. Gurman reveals that ""Apple has already opened up NFC access in Europe, and I am told that engineering work to do so in the US is already underway."" While there is no specific timeline provided, if things progress smoothly in the EU, Apple will likely work towards implementing this seismic change in the US in the near future.

In conclusion, Apple's control over the NFC chip in the iPhone has been a contentious issue for some time. The company has maintained strict access to the chip, citing security and privacy concerns, as well as protecting its own financial interests. However, recent developments suggest that Apple may be preparing to change its stance, as it has already opened up NFC access in Europe and is reportedly making progress towards doing the same in the US. While the exact timeline remains uncertain, it appears that Apple is readying itself for a potential shift in NFC chip accessibility.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6601869f70d828f8cfe50372/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3662,2060,x0,y591,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 10:15:49,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-deep-geothermal-renewable-powerhouse.html,Dig deep: US bets on geothermal to become renewable powerhouse,"Geothermal energy is being positioned as a crucial component of the green transition in the United States. Despite currently accounting for only a small fraction of energy production, both businesses and the Biden administration are investing in technological advancements to make geothermal energy a reliable and scalable power source. Jennifer Granholm, the Energy Secretary, believes that if the heat beneath our feet can be harnessed, it could surpass hydroelectric and solar power by 2050.

Geothermal energy utilizes the high temperatures found underground to generate electricity and heat buildings. However, in 2022, it only contributed 1.6% to US energy consumption. To increase production, the US government has invested over $200 million in an experimental site in Utah, focusing on drilling exceptionally deep wells. This approach, known as Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), involves injecting water into naturally hot rocks located deep underground, making it different from traditional geothermal energy extraction methods.

The advantage of EGS is that it can be implemented anywhere, reducing the upfront risk for investors. Furthermore, the US government is allowing companies to convert permits for oil or gas exploration into geothermal licenses, streamlining the process. Compared to classic fracking, EGS uses fewer chemical additives and does not release hydrocarbons. Unlike solar or wind power, geothermal energy provides a steady flow of energy regardless of weather conditions or time of day.

Cost-wise, the US government predicts that the price of geothermal energy will decrease from $70 to $100 per megawatt-hour (MWh) to $45 by 2035. Existing drilling technology makes geothermal energy development quicker and more cost-effective. The US has been a leader in adopting this new technology, with other countries, like France, also exploring EGS but on a smaller scale.

One potential concern with geothermal drilling is the risk of inducing seismic activity, similar to fracking. However, the US Energy Department has implemented a mitigation protocol and is investing in research to address this issue. So far, no community has experienced seismicity near a DOE-funded project.

Several start-ups in the US and Canada are competing in the emerging geothermal market and have secured significant investment. For example, Fervo Energy, in collaboration with Google, has connected its Nevada site to the electric grid, generating 3.5 megawatts of energy. As demand for geothermal energy grows, major companies like Google, Microsoft, and Nucor have announced their intention to purchase geothermal energy.

Despite the potential in the geothermal energy sector, there is still a need for the first successful commercial facility to inspire others to follow suit. As the market continues to develop, the primary objective is to ensure sustainable growth and establish geothermal energy as a reliable and clean power source for the future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/a-worker-operates-a-dr.jpg,2024-03-25 04:59:03,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-household-robots-common.html,Engineering household robots to have a little common sense,"Robots are becoming increasingly adept at performing complex household tasks, from cleaning spills to serving food. Many of these robots learn through imitation, copying the movements guided by a human. However, they often struggle to handle unexpected situations or disruptions unless explicitly programmed to do so. To address this issue, engineers at MIT have developed a method that combines robot motion data with the knowledge of large language models (LLMs). By connecting the physical actions of the robot with the logical subtasks identified by LLMs, the robot can adapt to disruptions and continue its task without starting from scratch.

The researchers demonstrated their approach using the example of scooping marbles from one bowl and pouring them into another. Traditionally, engineers would guide the robot through the entire motion in one continuous trajectory, which the robot would then mimic. However, the team realized that the task consists of a sequence of subtasks, such as reaching into the bowl, scooping the marbles, and pouring them into the empty bowl. If the robot makes a mistake during any of these subtasks, it would have to start over unless explicitly programmed to recover from the failure.

To automate this recovery process, the researchers leveraged the capabilities of LLMs. These deep learning models analyze vast amounts of text and establish connections between words, sentences, and paragraphs. By prompting an LLM with a task, it can generate a sequence of subtasks involved in completing that task. For example, when asked about scooping marbles, an LLM might produce a list of verbs like ""reach,"" ""scoop,"" ""transport,"" and ""pour."" The team then developed an algorithm to connect these natural language labels with the robot's physical position or state, allowing the robot to understand its progress and autonomously replan and recover from disruptions.

This novel approach eliminates the need for engineers to explicitly program fixes for every possible failure scenario, making the process more efficient and less tedious. By combining the imitation learning approach with the capabilities of LLMs, robots can self-correct execution errors and improve overall task success.

The team's research opens up new possibilities for the development of household robots that can adapt to unforeseen circumstances and handle disruptions without human intervention. The ability to connect robot motion data with language models enables robots to gain a better understanding of the tasks they are performing and make adjustments accordingly. This advancement brings us closer to a future where robots can seamlessly integrate into our daily lives and assist with a wide range of household tasks.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/engineering-household.jpg,2024-03-25 09:48:20,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-large-language-simple-mechanism-knowledge.html,Large language models use a surprisingly simple mechanism to retrieve some stored knowledge,"Large language models (LLMs) are incredibly complex tools used in various applications like customer support, code generation, and language translation. However, scientists still have limited understanding of how these models work. To gain insight into their inner workings, researchers at MIT and other institutions conducted a study on the mechanisms involved when LLMs retrieve stored knowledge.

The study revealed an interesting finding: LLMs often employ a simple linear function to decode and recover stored facts. These linear functions, characterized by two variables and no exponents, capture the straightforward relationship between variables. Remarkably, the model uses the same decoding function for similar types of facts.

By identifying linear functions for different facts, the researchers were able to explore the model's knowledge on new topics and pinpoint where that knowledge is stored within the model. Using a technique they developed to estimate these simple functions, the researchers discovered that even when the model provides an incorrect answer, it often retains the correct information. This approach could potentially be used in the future to identify and rectify falsehoods within the model, thereby reducing the occurrence of incorrect or nonsensical answers.

The lead authors of the paper detailing these findings are Evan Hernandez, an electrical engineering and computer science graduate student at MIT, and Arnab Sharma, a computer science graduate student at Northeastern University. The research, conducted in collaboration with other institutions, will be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024) in Vienna.

Most LLMs, also known as transformer models, are neural networks that consist of interconnected nodes or neurons grouped into multiple layers. These networks encode and process data, storing knowledge as relations that connect subjects and objects. For example, the relation ""Miles Davis plays the trumpet"" connects the subject (Miles Davis) to the object (trumpet).

As a transformer model acquires more knowledge, it stores additional facts about a particular subject across different layers. When a user poses a query related to that subject, the model must decode the most relevant fact to provide an accurate response. For instance, if a user prompts the model with ""Miles Davis plays the...,"" the model should respond with ""trumpet"" rather than ""Illinois"" (the state where Miles Davis was born).

The researchers conducted a series of experiments to investigate LLMs and found that despite their complexity, these models use a simple linear function to decode relational information. Each function is specific to the type of fact being retrieved. For instance, one decoding function is used to output the instrument a person plays, while a different function is used to output the state where a person was born.

To estimate these simple functions, the researchers developed a method and computed functions for 47 different relations, such as ""capital city of a country"" and ""lead singer of a band."" Although there are countless possible relations, the researchers focused on this subset as they represent the types of facts that can be expressed in this manner.

To test each function, the researchers altered the subject and observed if the correct object information could still be recovered. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the linear decoding functions for the chosen relations.

This study sheds light on the internal mechanisms of LLMs and uncovers the presence of simple linear functions within these complex models. Understanding these mechanisms can contribute to improving the accuracy and reliability of LLMs, making them even more valuable tools in various fields.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/large-language-models-2.jpg,2024-03-25 09:34:06,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-strategy-suppress-strain-propagation-ultrahigh.html,A strategy to suppress strain propagation in ultrahigh-Ni cathodes during fast charging,"To support the growing demand for the electronics industry and the widespread use of electric vehicles, researchers are continuously striving to develop advanced and high-performing battery technologies. One promising approach to enhance the performance of lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) is the use of nickel (Ni)-rich layered oxides as cathode materials.

Ni-rich cathodes offer several advantages, including increased battery capacity, improved rate capabilities, and reduced fabrication costs. However, these cathodes also have limitations, such as capacity degradation and structural instability during fast-charging and long-term cycling.

Recently, a group of researchers from Argonne National Laboratory and other institutes worldwide introduced a strategy to address the structural stability and reliability of ultrahigh-Ni cathodes. Their approach, outlined in a paper published in Nature Energy, involves the use of epitaxial entropy-assisted oxide coating to suppress strain propagation, which typically leads to structural deterioration in cathodes during fast-charging and prolonged cycling.

The researchers explained that surface reconstruction and the associated strain propagation have long been recognized as the major causes of cathode failure during fast charging and long-term cycling. Despite numerous attempts, no known strategies have been able to simultaneously address the electro-chemomechanical instability without sacrificing energy and power density.

To overcome this challenge, the researchers developed an epitaxial entropy-assisted coating strategy for ultrahigh-Ni LiNi x Co y Mn 1−x−y O 2 (x ≥ 0.9) cathodes using an oriented attachment-driven reaction between Wadsley–Roth phase-based oxides and the layered-oxide cathodes.

Essentially, the team designed a specialized oxide coating that aligns with the structure of Ni-rich cathodes. These coatings not only improve the robustness of the cathode materials' surface but also enhance ionic conductivity, thereby supporting fast charging of batteries.

The coating is based on Wadsley-Roth crystallographic shear phases, a class of compounds known to enhance the performance of electrodes in LiBs. Notably, these compounds adhere well to Ni-rich cathodes, strengthening their structural stability during prolonged operation and fast-charging.

The researchers found that the entropy-assisted surface coating significantly improved the fast charging/discharging capability, wide temperature tolerance, and thermal stability of the ultrahigh-Ni cathodes. Through comprehensive analysis at different scales, they observed reduced lattice dislocations, anisotropic lattice strain, oxygen release, and improved bulk/local structural stability, even when charging beyond the threshold state of charge (75%) of layered cathodes.

To validate their proposed coating strategy, the researchers conducted a series of experiments where they coated Ni-rich layered cathodes and evaluated their performance over time and under various conditions. The results were highly promising, as the approach effectively reduced damage to cathodes, even during fast-charging and after multiple operation cycles.

The researchers believe that the epitaxial entropy-assisted coating strategy opens up opportunities for surface engineering in the design and development of high-energy and high-power LiBs and beyond.

In conclusion, the use of nickel-rich layered oxides as cathode materials holds great potential for enhancing the performance of lithium-ion batteries. By employing an epitaxial entropy-assisted oxide coating, researchers have successfully addressed the structural stability and reliability of ultrahigh-Ni cathodes. This coating strategy not only suppresses strain propagation but also improves ionic conductivity, leading to improved battery performance during fast-charging and prolonged cycling. The findings of this study offer valuable insights for the design and development of high-energy and high-power LiBs in the future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/a-strategy-to-suppress.jpg,2024-03-25 09:40:01,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.forbes.com/sites/adrianbridgwater/2024/03/25/the-ever-changing-face-of-software-modernization/,The Ever Changing Face Of Software Modernization,"GIZA, EGYPT - OCTOBER 27: Visitors pose by the ""Orb: Under the same Sun"" installation by Madrid-based international artist SpY at the Giza pyramids necropolis during the second edition of the Art D’Égypte exhibition ""Forever is Now"" on October 27, 2022, in Giza, Egypt.

Software is undergoing a modernization process, often referred to as digital transformation. This shift involves the use of cloud-native infrastructures to power always-on applications for both enterprises and consumers, including gaming.

However, software modernization is a continuous process. What was considered modern last year may no longer be up to date this year. The rapid rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) last year serves as a prime example of this phenomenon.

To understand the future trends in the IT industry, reports, surveys, and analysis initiatives are conducted to provide quantifiers, qualifiers, and identifiers. Red Hat's recent ""State of Application Modernization Report,"" in partnership with research firm Illuminas, highlights new movements in the field. While enterprise application containers were popular last year, the report suggests that Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines have taken precedence in the always-on world of connected cloud.

It's worth noting that trends in software modernization are ever-changing. Next year, containers might regain their popularity, accompanied by the integration of generative AI.

Nutanix, a multi-cloud platform company, is also keeping a close eye on software modernization. Their sixth global Enterprise Cloud Index (ECI) survey and research report reveal an increasing adoption of hybrid multi-cloud models. These models combine private on-premises clouds with public cloud services from hyperscalers, as well as services that span both realms. The study forecasts a doubling of hybrid multi-cloud adoption within the next one to three years.

Hybrid multi-cloud refers to a combination of private on-premises cloud and public cloud services from various Cloud Services Providers (CSPs). Multi-cloud entails services from multiple CSPs, including major vendors like Microsoft Azure, AWS, Google Cloud Services, as well as secondary tier providers such as Oracle, IBM, and China-based providers like Alibaba. The decision to opt for a multi-cloud approach depends on factors like price, local data governance legislation, and technical considerations.

Moreover, there is also the concept of poly-cloud, where a monolithic application distributes its workloads across different clouds. Regardless of the specific definition, software modernization in this context involves adopting cloud infrastructures that address the challenges posed by AI, security, and sustainability.

As organizations navigate the complexities of application and data migration, the Nutanix report emphasizes the importance of hybrid multi-cloud infrastructure. Security and innovation emerge as the primary drivers for moving applications across environments in the past year. With AI taking center stage, respondents identified increasing investments in AI strategies as their top priority, closely followed by investments in IT modernization.

Lee Caswell, Senior Vice President for Product & Solutions Marketing at Nutanix, emphasizes the growing pressure on IT organizations to modernize their infrastructure quickly, driven by factors like AI, sustainability, and security. The survey reveals that 80% of respondents plan to invest in IT modernization, with 85% intending to increase their investments.

In conclusion, software modernization is an ongoing process that requires organizations to stay updated with the latest trends and technologies. The shift towards cloud-native infrastructures and the adoption of hybrid multi-cloud models are key drivers in this transformation. As AI becomes increasingly important, investments in AI strategies and IT modernization are at the forefront of organizations' priorities. By embracing these changes, businesses can adapt and thrive in an ever-evolving digital landscape.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660181597188fb59284d9023/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 10:28:24,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/gostudent-tutoring-profitability/,"GoStudent, the online learning platform, says it's now profitable","GoStudent, the online tutoring marketplace based in Vienna, Austria, has not only established itself as one of the largest and most popular startups in the country, but it has also achieved profitability. According to CEO Felix Ohswald, the company is now in the black across its global operations. This is a significant milestone for GoStudent, which is valued at $3.2 billion and has 11 million families and 23,000 tutors on its platform.

Ohswald clarified that the company is not just EBITDA profitable, but it also has positive operating cash flow. This achievement places GoStudent among the few Austrian startups that have made a name for themselves in the international tech scene. However, reaching profitability was not without challenges.

Like many technology companies, GoStudent faced a market crash during the boom of online learning and remote experiences. The company experienced a decline in customer demand and significant cash burn. In 2021, GoStudent lost €89 million, and this figure increased to €220 million in 2022. As a result, the company had to implement cost-cutting measures and carry out several rounds of layoffs.

GoStudent's rapid growth from 2019 to 2022, with over €100 million in revenue, led to exponential scaling but also massive cash burn. Despite raising hundreds of millions of euros in funding, the company realized it needed to change its approach. In 2023, it reduced its burn rate by 70%, but additional measures were required. Earlier this year, GoStudent announced another round of layoffs, marking the third since 2022.

These restructuring efforts were challenging but necessary for the company to continue growing sustainably. GoStudent learned valuable lessons about scaling, prioritization, and careful decision-making. The company recognized that it needed to reduce expenses and focus on key areas of growth.

The COVID-19 pandemic brought significant digital transformation to the education sector, benefiting edtech companies like GoStudent. Initially, GoStudent had to convince parents about the advantages of online tutoring, but it eventually became the go-to solution for students seeking educational support. However, despite the company's success, it was burning cash and needed to find a solution.

To address this issue, GoStudent made strategic cuts outside its core business. It eliminated extravagant parties, halted acquisitions, and refrained from expanding into markets where online tutoring was not established. The company also exited the U.S. market after a short period due to intense competition. GoStudent's focus shifted to Europe, and it adopted a more organic growth strategy.

The company's recent acquisition of StudienKreis, a physical learning center network founded in 1974, demonstrates its evolving approach. GoStudent plans to leverage StudienKreis's resources to enhance hybrid learning. CEO Ohswald believes that the future of education is hybrid, and GoStudent aims to provide personalized tutoring to students regardless of their location.

Most of GoStudent's tutors are university students, which allows them to connect with pupils more effectively. The company's commitment to personalized learning and its mission to unlock the potential of every student remain unchanged. As it continues to grow, GoStudent will need to strike a balance between scaling at lower costs and maintaining its personalized approach.

In conclusion, GoStudent's journey to profitability has been marked by challenges and significant changes. The company has overcome financial hurdles and is now focused on sustainable growth in the European market. With its innovative approach to online tutoring and commitment to personalized learning, GoStudent is well-positioned to achieve its goal of becoming the leading global school.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Founders-of-GoStudent-Gregor-Muller-I-Felix-Ohswald-2.jpg?w=1024,2024-03-25 11:00:36,Innovation,Innovation
