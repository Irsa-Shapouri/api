She is also a member of the East Suburban Atlanta Chapter of Jack and Jill of America, Inc. She organized the event and invited me to speak. I was honored to have the opportunity to share my journey and inspire these young minds.

During my talk, I emphasized the importance of representation in STEM fields. I shared stories of successful Black scientists who have made significant contributions to their fields, such as Dr. George Washington Carver and Mae Jemison. I wanted the students to see that they too can achieve greatness in science.

I also discussed the barriers that Black students face in pursuing STEM careers. The lack of visible examples of Black achievement and the perception that STEM fields are not welcoming to racial minorities and women are significant factors. These barriers can deter young Black students from pursuing their passions in science.

To address these issues, I highlighted the need for increased visibility of diverse role models in STEM. By showcasing successful scientists from underrepresented groups, we can inspire and motivate young students to pursue their dreams. Additionally, I stressed the importance of mentorship in guiding and supporting aspiring scientists. Mentorship can provide guidance, encouragement, and a sense of belonging that is crucial for success in STEM.

Furthermore, I emphasized the need to challenge cultural perceptions of success and showcase the value of STEM careers. Many students are steered towards more traditional professions, such as law or business, because they are seen as more prestigious or financially rewarding. We must highlight the exciting and impactful work that can be done in STEM fields to change these perceptions.

Retention efforts were also discussed as a crucial aspect of fostering an inclusive STEM ecosystem. It is not enough to attract students to STEM; we must also provide the support and resources necessary to keep them engaged and motivated. Creating a welcoming and inclusive environment is essential for the success and well-being of all scientists.

Lastly, I emphasized the importance of diverse perspectives in STEM research and development. Innovation thrives when different ideas and experiences are brought to the table. By creating a more inclusive environment, we can unlock the full potential of scientific discovery and advancement.

In conclusion, my experience speaking to the group of students reminded me of the power of engagement and mentorship in shaping young minds. As a seasoned scientist, I am committed to inspiring and encouraging the next generation of scientists, especially those from underrepresented backgrounds. By addressing the barriers and challenges that Black students face in STEM, we can create a more inclusive and successful scientific community. Together, we can make a difference and change perceptions about what it means to be a scientist.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660034c3235190ae18aa9cf0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 11:18:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2024/03/24/apple-ios-18-biggest-ever-iphone-update-more-details-emerge/,Apple iOS 18 Biggest-Ever iPhone Update: More Details Emerge,"Apple is known for introducing new operating software for its products, and this year is no exception. At the World Wide Developers Conference in early June, Apple is expected to unveil iOS 18, the next iPhone OS. According to a recent leak, iOS 18 is predicted to be the biggest-ever update for the iPhone.

One of the most significant changes in iOS 18 will be to the home screen, as reported by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman in his Power On newsletter. Over the years, there have been various changes to the iPhone's home screen, from the all-black background in the early iPhones to colorful wallpapers and the option to add personal photos. Visual improvements, such as the Depth Effect, have also been introduced, giving the illusion of app icons floating above the background. More recently, Apple added support for widgets, which had long been available on Android phones but were executed more elegantly on the iPhone.

According to Gurman, the home screen in iOS 18 will be ""more customizable,"" possibly resembling the improvements made to the lock screen in iOS 16. Gurman has previously stated that this year's iOS update is highly anticipated within Apple, with some calling it the biggest update in the company's history. This news has certainly generated excitement for Apple's developers conference in June.

In addition to the home screen changes, Apple is said to be focusing on AI tools that assist in managing daily life. While details are still scarce, there are rumors of significant upgrades to Siri, utilizing large-language models to enhance its capabilities as a personal assistant. Improved natural conversation abilities and deeper integration with Apple iMessage are also expected. Apple has also announced its plans to adopt Rich Communication Services (RCS) as part of iMessage in 2024, with groundwork potentially laid in iOS 18. RCS will enable better interoperability between iPhone and Android messages, although it's unlikely that Android's green message bubbles will turn blue like those of iMessage.

While there is much anticipation surrounding iOS 18, there is still more to be revealed in the coming months leading up to its release. Apple's commitment to innovation and improvement ensures that users can expect a thrilling and feature-rich experience with the next iPhone update.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65e217bee36cf08eab202281/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2492,1662,x0,y102,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 13:00:50,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/techcrunch-mobility-the-wheels-are-starting-to-come-off-the-fisker-ev-bus/,TechCrunch Mobility: The wheels are starting to come off the Fisker EV bus,"TechCrunch Mobility is a weekly newsletter dedicated to the latest news and insights on transportation. In this edition, we'll discuss the recent proposed standards from the Biden Administration, Uber's first investment in Africa, Apple's antitrust suit extending to cars, and DoorDash's partnership with Wing for drone delivery. 

First, let's address the proposed standards from the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released by the Biden Administration. These standards will have a significant impact on U.S. automakers and consumers. While they have been softened to accommodate the automotive industry, they still impose stricter regulations than before. 

The DOE's ""petroleum equivalency factor"" provides EVs with a score under the government's corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. The original proposal would have made it challenging for automakers to meet these standards, resulting in hefty fines. On the other hand, the EPA's tailpipe standards for 2027 to 2032 model year cars and light-duty trucks are more flexible, allowing automakers to meet the rules using various powertrains. This technology-agnostic approach is less stringent than the initial proposal, which required EV sales to make up 67% of the total U.S. passenger vehicle market by 2032. 

While these standards don't have a significant impact on EV startups like Rivian, Tesla, and Lucid, which already meet the clean car standard, legacy automakers face challenges. They are investing billions into developing and selling EVs while still making profits from internal combustion engine vehicles. Plug-in hybrids may be the ones benefiting the most from these regulations. 

Moving on to other news, let's talk about Moove, an African mobility fintech startup that offers vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers. Recently, Moove raised $100 million in a Series B funding round led by Uber. Uber's interest in Moove is driven by the fact that Moove is its largest car financing and vehicle supply partner. Additionally, Moove aligns with Uber's commitment to a fully zero-emission fleet by 2040, as they prioritize EVs in their business strategy. 

In other investment news, Amber, a Bay Area startup founded in early 2023, raised $3.18 million in a seed round for its aftermarket Tesla extended warranty product. Candela, an electric boat maker, secured $25 million in a funding round led by Groupe Beneteau. Lastly, Pelikan Mobility, a French startup, received funding for its innovative electric bike technology. 

These developments show the increasing investment and interest in sustainable transportation solutions. As the world moves towards a greener future, startups and established companies alike are finding opportunities in the mobility sector. 

That's all for this week's edition of TechCrunch Mobility. Stay tuned for more exciting news and updates on the future of transportation.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1363022906.jpg?resize=1200,730",2024-03-24 19:00:33,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/technology/article/moba-games/,Top Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) Games,"MOBAs, or multiplayer online battle arena games, have taken the gaming world by storm in the past 15 years. What started as a simple modification for a popular strategy game has now evolved into a genre of its own, with standalone iterations competing to be the top MOBA games in the world. While many have fallen by the wayside, the giants of the genre continue to attract millions of players every month. However, finding the best MOBA for you can still be a challenge if you're not sure where to look.

So, what exactly is a multiplayer online battle arena game? A MOBA is an online game that pits two teams, usually consisting of five players each, against each other in a strategic battle to destroy the opponent's base using unique player-controlled characters. These games are typically played on PC or mobile devices and have gained popularity due to their difficult-to-master gameplay.

The MOBA genre originated as a mod for Warcraft III, a popular strategy game with a thriving modding scene. The first game credited as a MOBA is Defense of the Ancients (DotA), which started as a mod but eventually became a major game in its own right. Some members of the DotA mod team went on to create their own MOBA, League of Legends, which quickly became a sensation. Valve, the developers of the Steam games platform, then recruited members of the original DotA team to build Dota 2, a competitor to League of Legends. This sparked a period in which every major publisher attempted to develop their own MOBA, but most failed to gain traction.

Over the years, hundreds of MOBAs have been released across various platforms. Some have become global phenomena, while others have faded into obscurity within months. The top MOBA games today are those that have stood the test of time and have garnered a large and dedicated player base. These games bring something unique to the table or have managed to captivate players for years.

Two of the biggest MOBAs in the world, Dota 2 and League of Legends, have been around for over a decade and continue to innovate in a genre filled with copycats. Dota 2, the direct sequel to the original mod, has retained the essence of its predecessor while becoming more accessible to a wider audience. It has been one of the most popular games on Steam for over 10 years and continues to push the boundaries of the genre. With constant updates, changes to the map, and the addition of new characters, Dota 2 remains a challenging game with a steep learning curve. It is often considered one of the most complex games in the world, offering a multitude of variables in every match. Despite its complexity, Dota 2 is free to play, with optional microtransactions for cosmetic items.

League of Legends, on the other hand, is the largest MOBA in terms of player base, boasting over 100 million active players per month. Its success revolutionized the industry and sparked the MOBA craze. Developed by Riot Games, a team of developers from the original DotA mod, League of Legends aimed to simplify some of the more complex aspects of the genre while maintaining the core gameplay. The game features a three-lane map, with teams of five battling to destroy the enemy's base. While it may be slightly less complex than Dota 2, League of Legends still offers a challenging and engaging experience.

With their enduring popularity and critical acclaim, Dota 2 and League of Legends are considered the best of the best in the MOBA genre. These games have received constant updates and improvements, ensuring that players can still jump in today and have a great time. Whether you're looking for a complex and challenging experience or a slightly more accessible game, both Dota 2 and League of Legends offer something for every MOBA enthusiast.

In conclusion, MOBAs have taken the gaming world by storm, and finding the best one for you can be a daunting task. However, with games like Dota 2 and League of Legends leading the pack, you can be assured of a thrilling and engaging experience. So, gather your team, choose your heroes, and dive into the world of MOBAs for an unforgettable gaming adventure.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fb05c9fa323af23f667c73/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 14:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
