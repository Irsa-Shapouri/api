https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/24/new-whatsapp-warning-iphone-15-pro-max-samsung-s24-ultra-upgrade/,New WhatsApp Warning Suddenly Issued For 2 Billion Users,"WhatsApp has recently released a major upgrade, but there is one setting that you should avoid using at all costs. It can have dangerous consequences, so it's important to be aware of this potential risk. This year, 2024, we are witnessing significant changes in the messaging landscape. From iMessage adopting RCS, WhatsApp introducing a third-party chat hub, Gemini AI integrating into Google Messages, to the Department of Justice (DOJ) suing Apple with iMessage playing a central role. These changes all revolve around a misunderstanding of end-to-end encryption, which has been used by messaging platforms like iMessage, WhatsApp, and Signal for years. Recently, Google Messages and Facebook Messenger have made end-to-end encryption their default setting.

The level of security provided by full encryption is so crucial that WhatsApp has issued a warning that third-party chats are not as secure as WhatsApp-to-WhatsApp chats. It was also a key point in the DOJ's argument that Apple makes iPhone users less secure by not providing full iMessage security on Android. Despite pressure from various governments and security agencies, Facebook Messenger has also made end-to-end encryption the default setting.

Given the importance of encryption, it is surprising to see some media reports encouraging users to transfer their chats and chat history from WhatsApp to Telegram. WhatsApp does allow users to export their chats and select Telegram as the recipient. However, it's alarming because Telegram does not provide end-to-end encryption by default. Its ""secret chat"" option needs to be manually selected for each individual chat. Kaspersky, a cybersecurity company, warned that Telegram is not as secure as it claims to be. By default, Telegram chats do not use end-to-end encryption, and users are not informed about the secure chat option. This raises concerns about the privacy of user correspondence.

Therefore, moving chats from WhatsApp, which is end-to-end encrypted by default, to Telegram, which is not, is a significant security risk. This is especially true for group chats that contain otherwise secure content from multiple users. Even WhatsApp, which is part of Mark Zuckerberg's data-hungry empire, uses end-to-end encryption by default. Users don't need to do anything; their messages are protected from all outsiders, including the service owners, right from the start.

When Telegram first promoted WhatsApp chat migration, I warned users about the potential dangers, despite the backlash against WhatsApp following Meta's (formerly Facebook) attempt to change user terms and conditions. This plan was quickly abandoned. As Jake Moore from ESET advises, removing content from end-to-end encrypted messaging platforms removes the protective barriers designed to safeguard messages. While accessibility is important in today's online world, it should not come at the cost of security and privacy.

Telegram emphasizes its cross-platform usability, making it easy for clients to access content on its central servers. However, if Telegram were to implement end-to-end encryption, this would not be possible. Telegram also promotes reduced smartphone storage by storing everything in its cloud. However, its architecture prioritizes accessibility and simplicity over full encryption. The level of data security is based on policy rather than technology.

Based on these factors, I strongly advise against following any advice to switch from WhatsApp to Telegram. It is a step backward, regardless of what the marketing may suggest. Additionally, there are other issues to consider. Telegram plays contrasting roles in the messaging world. On one hand, it aims to be an easy-to-use alternative to WhatsApp with a wide range of features, which is why it offers a migration option. On the other hand, it has a darker side. Spain's High Court recently suspended Telegram due to its lack of content controls. The Financial Times has also reported on Telegram's similarities to the dark web, with some referring to it as ""social media for organized criminals."" However, it is not just criminals who use Telegram; it is also popular among campaigners and activists.

In conclusion, it is crucial to understand the potential risks and drawbacks before considering a switch from WhatsApp to Telegram. While Telegram may offer certain advantages, such as cross-platform usability and cloud storage, its lack of default end-to-end encryption and issues with content control raise concerns about privacy and security. It is important to prioritize the protection of personal information and choose messaging platforms that prioritize secure communication.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65b41420a2b346798e66d370/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2207,1442,x681,y315,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 23:45:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have experienced remarkable growth in recent years, and they share some striking similarities. Both companies stumbled upon their core businesses by chance. AWS discovered it could sell its internal services to others, while Nvidia realized that its gaming GPU was well-suited for AI workloads. This led to explosive revenue growth for both companies, with Nvidia's revenue increasing from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024 to $22.1 billion in Q4 2024.

While AWS has consistently been a significant revenue driver for Amazon, Nvidia's growth has been even more impressive. However, as the market becomes more competitive and the law of large numbers sets in, sustaining this growth may become a challenge for Nvidia. Nonetheless, Nvidia's short-term financial outlook remains positive, with the company expecting around $24 billion in revenue for Q1 FY25, a 234% increase compared to the previous year's first quarter.

Analysts predict that Nvidia will generate $110.5 billion in revenue for its current fiscal year, an 81% increase from the previous year. While this growth rate is lower than what Nvidia achieved in its recently concluded fiscal year, it is still impressive. The company is expected to continue scaling its revenue past the $100 billion annual run rate mark, demonstrating significant growth potential.

AI is likely to drive Nvidia's growth in the coming years, even as competition from other chipmakers such as AMD and Intel emerges. Nvidia currently holds a dominant position in the market, but it will face stiffer competition in the future. However, its strong market control allows it to withstand this competition. At the chip level, Nvidia maintains a firm hold, according to IDC data. While AMD is gaining ground at the board level, Nvidia still maintains a significant lead, as reported by Jon Peddie Research.

In conclusion, Nvidia has the potential to become a long-term revenue powerhouse, similar to AWS for Amazon. Its short-term financial outlook is positive, with significant growth expected in the coming quarters. While challenges may arise in the future, Nvidia's dominant position in the market and its focus on AI provide a strong foundation for continued success.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/25/google-upgrade-samsung-s24-s23-pixel-towards-apple-iphone-15-pro-max/,Google Suddenly Reveals Surprise Android Update That Beats iPhone,"Android and iPhone are constantly competing to offer users the best features and functionality. In a surprising turn of events, Google has just unveiled a new update for Android that not only matches an existing iPhone feature but goes above and beyond. This update is a significant step forward for Android and could potentially revolutionize the way we use our smartphones.

One of the standout features of this update is the inclusion of an emergency satellite service. This functionality has been available on iPhones for a few years, but now Android users will also have access to this life-saving feature. In fact, Google's offering even includes a Garmin rescue service, further enhancing the safety and security of its users.

However, the difference between Apple's emergency SOS feature and Google's new offering lies in its usability. Apple's feature is specifically designed for emergencies, so for those of us who aren't climbing mountains or sailing oceans, it remains largely unused. Google's update, on the other hand, allows users to expand their cellular accounts to include a satellite add-on. This means that even in areas with poor cellular coverage, users can still stay connected through the satellite network.

The Android 15 developer preview provides a glimpse into the future of satellite connectivity. It introduces UI elements that ensure a consistent user experience for devices with satellite connectivity and expands platform support for satellite connectivity through a new API. Additionally, messaging apps will be able to utilize satellite connectivity for sending and receiving messages, offering a seamless communication experience.

Apple's satellite connectivity remains more limited, with the ability to connect to a satellite only available on select iPhone models. This feature allows users to text emergency services, request roadside assistance, and share their location with friends and family when they have no mobile or Wi-Fi coverage. However, Google's update suggests that Android might go even further, potentially partnering with T-Mobile to offer satellite messaging capabilities. This opens up the possibility of direct-to-phone satellite connectivity becoming more accessible in the future.

The integration of satellite messaging in Android 15 marks a significant milestone in bridging the gap between Android and iPhone. Google's proactive approach in introducing this feature could very well set the trend for Apple to follow. As both operating systems continue to evolve, it's clear that they are becoming more alike in terms of features and functionality.

The recent news of Gemini potentially coming to iPhone further highlights the close competition between Android and iPhone. Gemini, an AI-powered workhorse, could play a crucial role in iOS 18's updates. This development not only brings Android and iPhone closer together but also strengthens Google's presence within the iPhone ecosystem.

In conclusion, Google's new update for Android is a game-changer. The inclusion of an emergency satellite service and the potential for messaging integration with satellite connectivity showcase Google's commitment to innovation and user experience. As Android and iPhone continue to push boundaries, it's exciting to see how these advancements will shape the future of smartphones.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65d79ec3dadcd6b682668331/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 00:06:15,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2024/03/24/the-walking-dead-the-ones-who-live-episode-5-review---another-massively-disappointing-episode/,‘The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live’ Episode 5 Review - Another Massively Disappointing Episode,"The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live has had its ups and downs throughout the season, and the second-to-last episode is no exception. While it wasn't as tedious as the previous episode, it was still filled with preposterous moments and convenient plot points that left me feeling disappointed. Spoilers ahead.

The episode, titled ""Become,"" starts and ends with a surprising cameo from Gabriel. Many had anticipated a cameo from Morgan, who had set out to find Rick after leaving Fear The Walking Dead. Personally, I have grown tired of Morgan's character, especially after his disappointing arc on Fear. It's a shame because he used to be one of my favorites. However, his character was poorly utilized on both shows, with random moments of insanity and nonsensical catchphrases. It's truly a missed opportunity.

Despite my disappointment with Morgan's character, I did enjoy the flashback scenes featuring Gabriel and Jadis. They added suspense, especially when we learned that Jadis had killed a confidante. I genuinely thought Gabriel would meet his demise in this episode. It would have been a bold move for the series, but unfortunately, The Walking Dead has become risk-averse. Instead, Jadis meets her end, rambling about her transformation and the choices she has made.

Although the episode had some interesting moments, it suffered from implausibility. Rick and Michonne, presumed dead and on the run, stumble upon a group of survivors being attacked by ""stoners,"" zombies whose bodies have calcified and turned to stone. Initially, these stone walkers seem difficult to kill, but Rick and Michonne dispatch them with ease. Then, in a strange turn of events, the survivors turn on Rick and Michonne, holding them at gunpoint. However, our heroes quickly overpower them, making them promise to change their ways and even returning their weapons. I found this decision baffling. While I understand not wanting to kill them, returning their weapons seemed like a risky move.

Furthermore, I couldn't help but question the survival skills of these survivors. How have they managed to survive for over a decade into the apocalypse when they make such foolish and careless decisions? It's perplexing. By this point, one would expect anyone they encounter to possess the same level of skill and determination as Rick and Michonne. It's hard to believe that people this incompetent have made it this far.

On a lighter note, Rick and Michonne's romantic relationship has taken center stage. It's amusing to see how frequently they kiss in the midst of chaos. In the main show, their romantic moments were few and far between, but now it seems they can't keep their hands off each other. I suppose it's understandable considering the circumstances. They are lucky to have found a fully-powered smart home last week, where they engaged in intimate activities while the building was collapsing. This week, they stumble upon the Three Pines Cabin, a cozy retreat where they can relax and enjoy each other's company.

Unfortunately, their peaceful getaway is short-lived. The next morning, Jadis arrives at the cabin, guns drawn, ready for a confrontation. And that's where the episode ends, leaving us in suspense for the season finale.

Overall, ""Become"" had its share of flaws, from implausible plot points to questionable character decisions. However, it did have its moments of suspense and intrigue. With one episode left in the season, I hope The Walking Dead can redeem itself and leave viewers satisfied.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600b341eca045b614f49ec5/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=800,450,x0,y41,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 21:39:14,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/techcrunch-mobility-the-wheels-are-starting-to-come-off-the-fisker-ev-bus/,TechCrunch Mobility: The wheels are starting to come off the Fisker EV bus,"Welcome to TechCrunch Mobility, your go-to source for news and insights on the future of transportation. In this week's edition, we'll be discussing some important developments in the automotive industry, along with exciting updates from various mobility startups. So, let's dive in!

First, let's talk about the recent regulatory changes proposed by the Biden Administration. The Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have introduced new standards that will impact U.S. automakers and consumers alike. While these regulations have been adjusted to accommodate the concerns of the automotive industry, they still impose stricter requirements than previous standards.

The DOE has introduced a ""petroleum equivalency factor"" that assigns a score to electric vehicles (EVs) under the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. This move aims to ensure that automakers can meet the CAFE standards without facing hefty fines. The EPA, on the other hand, has released tailpipe standards for model year 2027 to 2032 cars and light-duty trucks. These standards are more flexible in terms of powertrain options, allowing automakers to comply using various technologies. The original proposal, which mandated EV sales to make up 67% of the U.S. passenger vehicle market by 2032, has been revised to be less stringent.

While these regulations may not significantly impact EV startups like Rivian, Tesla, and Lucid, they do pose challenges for legacy automakers. These companies are investing billions in EV development while still relying on profits from internal combustion engine vehicles. Plug-in hybrids might emerge as the winners in this scenario.

In other news, let's talk about Clevon, a company that has been developing autonomous delivery technology. Recently, there were reports suggesting that the company was struggling to secure new investments and might be on the verge of shutting down. However, according to CEO Sander Sebastian Agur, Clevon is still operational and has entered into an exclusivity agreement for a merger with an American EV company. The merger is expected to be completed by June.

Moving on to investment activities, Uber has made its first investment in an Africa-founded startup. The ride-hailing giant has led a $100 million Series B funding round for Moove, an African mobility fintech company that offers vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers. With this investment, Moove is now valued at $750 million. This partnership aligns with Uber's commitment to building a fully zero-emission fleet by 2040, as Moove has a strong focus on electric vehicles.

Lastly, let's highlight some other notable deals from this week. Amber, a Bay Area startup that provides aftermarket Tesla extended warranty products, raised $3.18 million in a seed round. Candela, an electric boat maker, secured $25 million in funding, led by Groupe Beneteau. And Pelikan Mobility, a French startup specializing in mobility solutions, received funding for its innovative projects.

That's all for this week's edition of TechCrunch Mobility. Stay tuned for more exciting updates on the future of transportation.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1363022906.jpg?resize=1200,730",2024-03-24 19:00:33,Innovation,Innovation
