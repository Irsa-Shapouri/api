Air pollution is a pressing issue that affects millions of people around the world. On days when pollution levels are high, the air becomes toxic and can have detrimental effects on our health. It is important for us to understand the leading cause of this pollution and take necessary steps to combat it. In this article, we will explore the impact of internal combustion engines on air pollution and the importance of implementing tailpipe emissions standards to address this problem.

The Impact of Internal Combustion Engines:
Internal combustion engines fueled by gas or diesel are the main culprits behind the dirty pollution that we breathe in. In fact, more than two-thirds of Americans rely on personal automobiles for their daily travel, making transportation the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. Light-duty vehicles alone contribute to almost 60% of climate pollution in the transportation sector.

The Need for Tailpipe Emissions Standards:
To tackle the pervasive air pollution problem, it is crucial to reduce tailpipe pollution from the cars we drive. Thankfully, we have a proven tool at our disposal - tailpipe emissions standards. These standards require automakers to adopt the latest clean technologies, ensuring that new vehicles are cleaner than ever before.

The Role of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA):
Recently, the EPA adopted new multi-pollutant rules for light-duty and smaller medium-duty vehicles, marking a historic moment in the fight against air pollution. These updated standards aim to limit tailpipe pollution and mitigate its adverse effects on our health and the environment. By compelling automakers to embrace clean technologies, the EPA is paving the way for a future with cleaner cars.

The Benefits of Clean Cars:
Everyone, regardless of their location, should have the option to choose a clean car. The impact of air pollution is widespread, affecting approximately 36% of the U.S. population, or nearly 120 million people. Unhealthy levels of air pollution can lead to various respiratory diseases, especially in children. People of color and lower-income individuals are disproportionately affected by this issue. By driving electric vehicles and reducing tailpipe emissions, we can improve air quality and protect the health of our communities.

Dispelling Misinformation:
Unfortunately, profit-driven corporate polluters have launched disinformation campaigns to undermine the EPA's efforts. These campaigns aim to mislead the public into thinking that the updated pollution limits are unnecessary and infringe on consumer choice. However, it is important to note that the EPA's standards are technology-neutral, performance-based, and grounded in scientific research. They do not ban specific technologies or modes of transportation but rather push for cleaner alternatives.

The Importance of the Clean Air Act:
The Clean Air Act, enacted in 1970, empowers the EPA to establish National Ambient Air Quality Standards to safeguard public health and welfare. It also mandates the regulation of emissions from vehicles and engines. Over time, the standards have evolved to adapt to changing environmental concerns. The implementation of these standards has led to significant improvements in air quality, as exemplified by the reduction in air pollution in cities like New York and Los Angeles.

Conclusion:
Air pollution is a serious issue that affects millions of people worldwide. It is essential for us to address the root causes of this problem, such as the pollution generated by internal combustion engines. By implementing tailpipe emissions standards and promoting the use of clean cars, we can make significant progress in improving air quality and protecting public health. It is our collective responsibility to support these initiatives and create a cleaner and healthier future for all.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fe401fc35aefb76700b52e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 07:45:00,Innovation,Innovation

She invited me to speak to the Jack and Jill kids about my journey as a scientist. The Jack and Jill organization is a prestigious African American family organization that focuses on the development of children through various activities and programs.

As I stood in front of those bright and eager young faces, I couldn't help but think about my own journey. Growing up as an only child with a single mother, I spent countless hours exploring nature and developing a curiosity for the world around me. I had a natural affinity for insects and weather, which eventually led me to pursue a career in atmospheric science.

But it wasn't an easy path. As a young Black boy interested in science, I faced many challenges and obstacles. There were no scientists within my immediate circle of influence, but I drew inspiration from the pages of books. One of my earliest mentors was Dr. George Washington Carver, an agricultural scientist at Tuskegee Institute. His innovative work with peanuts fascinated me and fueled my curiosity to understand the ""how's and why's"" of weather.

Unfortunately, the lack of representation in STEM fields is still a significant issue today. According to a recent study by the Pew Center, positive perceptions about STEM within the Black American community are low. Scientists and engineers are ranked lowest in terms of achievement, while professional athletes and musicians are viewed more positively.

This lack of representation can be a deterrent for Black students considering careers in STEM. Without visible examples of achievement, it's harder for them to envision themselves in those professions. Additionally, the study reveals that STEM fields can feel less welcoming for racial minorities and women, further exacerbating the barriers.

As someone who has experienced these challenges firsthand, I believe it's crucial to address these issues and create a more inclusive STEM ecosystem. We need to increase the visibility of diverse role models and showcase their achievements. Mentorship programs can play a vital role in guiding and supporting aspiring scientists. By demonstrating the viability of STEM careers and challenging cultural perceptions of success, we can encourage more students to pursue their interests in science and technology.

Retention efforts are also essential in ensuring that students and professionals feel welcomed and supported in STEM fields. We must create an environment where diverse ideas are valued and encouraged. After all, STEM research and development are at their best when all voices are heard.

The event with the Jack and Jill kids was a powerful reminder of the impact we can have on young minds. By sharing my own journey and experiences, I hope to inspire them to pursue their passions and overcome any obstacles they may face. Together, we can work towards a future where STEM fields are truly diverse and inclusive.

In conclusion, my experience speaking to the Jack and Jill kids served as a reminder of the importance of representation and mentorship in STEM fields. While progress has been made, there is still much work to be done. By increasing visibility, providing mentorship, challenging cultural perceptions, and fostering an inclusive environment, we can create a future where all aspiring scientists feel welcomed and supported. Let's continue to inspire the next generation of scientists and shape lives through scientific engagement.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660034c3235190ae18aa9cf0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 11:18:17,Innovation,Innovation

While everyone in North America will observe a partial eclipse on this day, only those within a narrow 115-mile path stretching through parts of Mexico, 15 U.S. states, and Canada will have the privilege of experiencing totality.

The path of totality on April 8, 2024, will pass through five states in Mexico, including Sinaloa, Nayarit, Durango, Coahuila, and Chihuahua. In the United States, it will traverse through Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee (northwest corner), Michigan (southeast corner), Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. Additionally, six Canadian provinces, namely Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland, will also be within the path of totality.

If you're eager to witness this extraordinary event, stay tuned for the latest updates on the total solar eclipse. Check regularly for new articles detailing travel and lodging options, ensuring you have the best experience possible.

In conclusion, total solar eclipses are incredibly rare and unforgettable occurrences. Many people mistakenly believe they have witnessed totality when they have only experienced a partial eclipse.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2024/03/24/unveiling-the-journey-of-a-social-media-influencer/,Unveiling The Journey Of A Social Media Influencer,"Have you ever wondered how social media influencers got their start and how it influenced their lives? Well, let me introduce you to Bruce Brackett, the CEO at BWB ART, who has his own unique story to tell.

Bruce admits that he used to have a blind eye to both the positive and negative aspects of social media. Like many of us, he had social media accounts but didn't really use them for anything other than sharing random thoughts or selfies. However, everything changed when he started sharing his personal experiences, strength, and hope with his followers. It was at this point that his social media presence began to grow exponentially.

One of the reasons for this growth was the vulnerability and relatability that Bruce infused into his posts. He realized that social media often gets a bad reputation for being a breeding ground for negativity and online bullying. Instead of perpetuating this trend, Bruce took a different approach. He developed a formula for his content: before posting anything, he would ask himself three questions. First, will it be helpful to others? Second, is it something he wants to contribute to the world? And finally, is it something that he personally needs to hear as well? If the answer was yes to all three, then he would share it.

By following this formula, Bruce was able to create a positive and supportive online environment for himself and his followers. He acknowledges that not all influencers are as lucky as he is, and many experience hate and negativity. However, Bruce believes that he has somehow managed to shield himself from these negative energies with his catchphrase, ""Negativity Be Gone."" This catchphrase represents his decision to no longer welcome or entertain negativity in his life. As a result, he has embraced a world full of positivity, and it has made all the difference.

Bruce recognizes that social media has been a game-changer for his career. It has provided him with endless opportunities for knowledge and connection. He feels incredibly fortunate to have built a successful career as an influencer, using social media as his stepping stone. It has not only changed his life for the better but has also allowed him to impact the lives of thousands of others.

In conclusion, Bruce's journey as a social media influencer is a testament to the power of vulnerability, relatability, and positivity. By sharing his experiences and spreading positivity, he has created a supportive online community that uplifts and inspires others. Social media has become more than just a platform for Bruce; it has become a tool for personal growth and a source of endless possibilities.

So, the next time you come across a social media influencer, remember that there is often more to their story than meets the eye. Behind the curated posts and flawless filters, there is a person who has harnessed the power of social media to make a difference in their own life and the lives of others.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fa921a8a459a2ef2abbef0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 11:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/technology/article/what-are-rpg-games/,What Is A Role-Playing Game? RPG Types Explained,"Role-playing games (RPGs) come in various forms and cater to different preferences. Some people enjoy the tabletop experience, where they gather with friends to roll dice and create stories. Others prefer RPG video games that offer character customization and interactive narratives. Whether you're a seasoned RPG player or a novice looking to try something new, this guide will introduce you to the most common types of RPGs and help you find the right game for you.

What Are Role-Playing Games?
Role-playing games allow players to assume the role of a character within a game that also serves as a story. The decisions made by players impact their character's development and shape the course of the story. While some RPGs have computer-controlled storylines, others involve interaction with other players.

The typical structure of an RPG involves players embodying a single character. They have control over the character's appearance, actions, and abilities throughout the story. Characters remain part of the narrative until they die, are removed by game elements, or the player decides to switch to a different character.

In this traditional setup, one player takes on the role of the Game Master (GM), also known as the Dungeon Master, Judge, Referee, Keeper, or other similar titles. The GM keeps the story on track, reacts to player actions, portrays supporting or antagonist characters, and resolves any rule disputes that arise. Game mastering can be a challenging yet rewarding role for those who enjoy being at the center of every game session.

Some RPGs offer a more collaborative structure where everyone has equal control over the narrative. The rules of the game determine who controls the story at any given time. These games often aim to emulate specific genres or capture the essence of other media forms like film or television.

Dungeons & Dragons, first published in 1974, is widely regarded as the earliest and most influential role-playing game. While other RPGs may have existed before it, Dungeons & Dragons captured the attention of a vast audience and inspired the creation of hundreds of other games, including many video games. RPGs on home computers and game consoles gained popularity in the 1980s and have continued to evolve ever since.

Even today, Dungeons & Dragons remains the most popular tabletop RPG on the market. It has recently made waves in the computer gaming world with the release of Baldur's Gate 3. However, there are numerous RPGs to explore, each with its own unique strengths that appeal to different fans.

Types of RPG Games
RPGs come in various forms, often blurring the lines and incorporating different features. Here are some of the most common styles of role-playing games, along with examples to help you understand each category.

1. MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game)
MMORPGs are played online by thousands, or even millions, of people. Players connect to a central server, create and improve their characters, and embark on quests. Some servers prioritize missions and character performance, while others encourage role-playing and staying in character at all times. World of Warcraft remains the most popular MMORPG, with other notable examples including Guild Wars 2, EVE Online, Star Wars: The Old Republic, and Black Desert Online.

2. ARPG (Action Role-Playing Game)
Action role-playing games emphasize combat as a major gameplay component. Players must master fighting techniques and ensure their characters are well-equipped for battles. While many ARPGs focus on single-player experiences, some also offer multiplayer elements. The Diablo series is a prime example of this genre. Other notable ARPGs include Elder Ring, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Borderlands.

3. CRPG (Computer or Console Role-Playing Game)
CRPG is a broad term that encompasses RPGs played on computers or video game consoles. These games typically offer single-player, pre-scripted experiences, where players follow a specific storyline with limited opportunities for exploration. Bioware games such as Mass Effect and Dragon Age exemplify this type of RPG. Additionally, titles like Planescape: Torment, Disco Elysium, and Shadowrun Returns are often associated with the CRPG label.

4. JRPG (Japanese Role-Playing Game)
JRPGs originated on game consoles and often blend fantasy and science fiction elements. These games typically revolve around party management and highlight dramatic relationships within a ""save the world"" storyline. Some renowned JRPGs include the Final Fantasy series, Dragon Quest, Persona, and Tales of series.

These are just a few examples of RPG genres, and there are many more to explore. Each type offers unique gameplay experiences and appeals to different preferences. Whether you enjoy immersive online worlds, intense combat-focused gameplay, or gripping storylines, there is an RPG out there for you.

Conclusion
Role-playing games have evolved over the years to cater to a wide range of interests and play styles. Whether you prefer gathering around a table with friends or immersing yourself in a virtual world, RPGs offer endless possibilities for storytelling and adventure. From classic tabletop games like Dungeons & Dragons to expansive online experiences like World of Warcraft, the world of RPGs is vast and diverse.

If you're new to RPGs, use this guide to explore the different types and find the game that suits you best. Remember, the most important aspect of any RPG is to have fun and let your imagination run wild. So gather your party, roll the dice, and embark on an unforgettable journey in the world of role-playing games.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fb562b1ede4feb9fc02f0c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1795,1010,x0,y92,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 12:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/apple-sued-microsofts-ai-ambitions-and-nvidia-surprises/,"Apple sued, Microsoft's AI ambitions and Nvidia's surprises","In this edition of Week in Review, we have some major news to cover. First, we'll discuss the latest Apple antitrust lawsuit, followed by Microsoft's AI ambitions. So, let's dive right in.

The U.S. has joined international regulators in accusing Apple of using monopolistic tactics to lock in iPhone users. Apple, in response, claims that the actions taken by the Department of Justice (DOJ) could ruin what its users enjoy about its phones and ecosystem.

The DOJ's lawsuit draws a comparison between Apple and Microsoft in the 1990s, although there are notable differences between the two companies and their efforts to retain customers.

However, it's unlikely that there will be significant developments in the lawsuit in the short-term. Experts predict that it could take three to five years for the case to reach a resolution.

Now, let's move on to other updates, such as Reddit's IPO, Nvidia's GTC event, and a surprising change for Glassdoor accounts.

In news related to Microsoft, the company has acquired the co-founders of Inflection AI, a high-profile AI startup. Mustafa Suleyman will now lead the consumer-facing unit Microsoft AI, while Karén Simonyan will serve as the EVP and CEO of the same group. This acquisition comes after Inflection raised $1.3 billion, with Microsoft being the biggest investor.

Nvidia's GTC developer conference brought some unexpected surprises. CEO Jensen Huang predicted that artificial general intelligence would be achievable within five years. Additionally, Nvidia announced a new AI platform called GR00T, designed for humanoid robots.

On the topic of Google, the company is reportedly in talks with Apple to deploy Google's AI model on upcoming iOS updates. This raises questions about whether this collaboration is a temporary solution until Apple's own AI efforts catch up, a long-term partnership, or an unsuccessful negotiation.

Moving on to hacking and privacy concerns, the Biden administration is forming an international coalition to combat commercial spyware. Interestingly, some investors joining this coalition were previously involved in the very business they're now fighting against.

In gaming news, a hack temporarily disrupted an Apex Legends tournament. The hackers claimed to have done it for fun and to highlight the exploit used to disrupt the tournament.

Glassdoor, a popular platform for employee reviews, has faced criticism recently. Users have reported that their real names are being added to their profiles without consent. The only solution offered to them is to delete their accounts entirely.

Now let's shift our focus to funding and IPOs. Reddit's IPO had a strong start, with the stock jumping 48% on its first day of trading. Astera Labs, a company specializing in connectivity hardware for cloud computing data centers, also saw success. Their stock closed at $62.03 on the first day, reflecting their revenue growth of 45% to $115.8 million last year.

In other funding news, The Browser Company, the startup behind the Arc browser, raised $50 million at a valuation of $550 million. The company's vision of replacing PCs with browsers is ambitious and has generated some controversy. However, their path to monetization remains unclear.

Lastly, let's touch on some bonus topics. Despite its massive potential, AI still struggles with spelling. AI-generated images often have spelling mistakes, leading to questions about the limitations of AI technology.

In automotive news, Fisker, an electric vehicle manufacturer, has paused production due to financial difficulties. If they fail to raise more capital, they may have to cease operations.

Finally, the review of AI systems like ChatGPT and Gemini is challenging due to their inability to be truly reviewed. However, it remains crucial to put these systems to the test, despite the limitations.

That concludes this edition of Week in Review. Stay tuned for more updates in the future.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/apple-antitrust-doj-splash.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-23 20:15:37,Innovation,Innovation
