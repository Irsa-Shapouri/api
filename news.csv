https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/24/new-whatsapp-warning-iphone-15-pro-max-samsung-s24-ultra-upgrade/,New WhatsApp Warning Suddenly Issued For 2 Billion Users,"WhatsApp's recent upgrade has brought about significant changes to the messaging landscape. However, there is one setting within the app that users should avoid at all costs as it can lead to dangerous consequences. This setting involves transferring chats and chat history from WhatsApp to Telegram, a messaging app that lacks default end-to-end encryption.

End-to-end encryption is a crucial feature that ensures the security and privacy of messages. Apps like iMessage, WhatsApp, and Signal have utilized this encryption for years, while Google Messages and Facebook Messenger have recently adopted it as well. The adoption of end-to-end encryption prompted WhatsApp to caution users that third-party chats would not be as secure as WhatsApp-to-WhatsApp chats. Similarly, the Department of Justice warned that Apple's denial of full iMessage security on Android made iPhone users less secure. Despite pressure from governments and security agencies, Facebook Messenger also made end-to-end encryption its default setting.

It is surprising to see media reports encouraging users to transfer their chats from WhatsApp to Telegram. While WhatsApp offers an export setting that allows chats to be transferred to Telegram, it's important to note that Telegram does not provide end-to-end encryption by default. Its ""secret chat"" option must be manually selected for each one-on-one conversation. Kaspersky, a renowned cybersecurity company, even warned that Telegram is not as secure as it claims to be. Unlike WhatsApp, which automatically encrypts messages, Telegram's chats are not protected by default, and users are not adequately informed about the secure chat option.

Transferring chats from WhatsApp, a platform with default end-to-end encryption, to Telegram, which lacks this feature, is a significant security risk. This is especially true for group chats that contain secure content from multiple users. Even WhatsApp, despite being part of a data-hungry empire, ensures end-to-end encryption without any user intervention. Messages are protected from all outsiders, including service owners, right from the start.

Earlier, when Telegram first introduced chat migration from WhatsApp, I warned users about the dangers of this practice. While it came during a backlash against WhatsApp due to changes in user terms and conditions, it was still a risky move. Jake Moore from ESET advises against pulling content out of end-to-end encrypted messaging platforms, as it removes the barriers that protect messages. Although accessibility is important in the online world, it should not come at the cost of security and privacy.

Telegram promotes itself as a cross-platform messaging app that is easy to use. However, this ease of use is possible because the content is stored on Telegram's central servers, which would not be possible if it were end-to-end encrypted. The platform also highlights the reduction in smartphone storage by storing everything in the cloud. However, Telegram's architecture prioritizes accessibility and simplicity over full encryption. The security of your data depends on policy rather than technology.

In conclusion, it is strongly advised not to follow the advice to switch from WhatsApp to Telegram. Despite marketing claims, transferring chats to Telegram is a step backward in terms of security. Additionally, there are other concerns surrounding Telegram, such as the lack of content controls that led to its suspension by Spain's High Court. The platform has also gained a reputation as a hub for organized criminals and has been described as ""social media for organized criminals"" by the CEO of LexisNexis Risk Solutions' government division. Therefore, it is crucial to exercise caution when choosing a messaging app and prioritize the security and privacy of your communications.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65b41420a2b346798e66d370/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2207,1442,x681,y315,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 23:45:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/24/meet-the-apps-that-tell-you-when-to-take-your-eclipse-glasses-off/,Meet The Apps That Tell You When To Take Your Eclipse Glasses Off,"When it comes to knowing when to remove your solar eclipse glasses, things can get a bit confusing. There are a few factors to consider: being in the path of totality, having a clear sky, and knowing the right time to take off your glasses to witness the sun's corona. It's this last point that often causes panic among eclipse chasers.

But fear not, it's actually quite simple. You remove your eclipse glasses when it gets dark. If you're lucky enough to be in the path of totality, the darkness will come quickly as the moon's shadow passes over you. It's an unforgettable moment that you won't miss. However, if you're not in the path of totality, it won't get dark, so you should keep your glasses on.

Now, there are some smartphone apps available that offer an immersive audio experience to guide you through the eclipse. These apps will tell you when to take off your glasses as totality begins and will also provide instructions on when to look for other phenomena, such as shadow bands, Baily's beads, and the diamond ring effect. They are particularly useful when used with bone conduction earphones, which allow you to still be aware of your surroundings.

One app worth mentioning is the Eclipse Company's app, which offers a ""Pro"" version with real-time weather updates, cloud forecasts, a countdown timer, and detailed information about local eclipse events. It also provides an immersive audio experience and alerts you when to look for eclipse phenomena. Another app is the Solar Eclipse Timer, developed by eclipse chaser and educator Gordon Telepun. It geolocates your position, guides you through the contact times, and is especially useful for photographers.

For those using iOS, there's also the OneEclipse app, created by Astronomers Without Borders and Simulation Curriculum. This app not only allows you to simulate the eclipse from your location or anywhere on Earth but also includes an interactive map with precise eclipse event times and a dynamic countdown clock.

So, if you're unsure about when to remove your solar eclipse glasses, these apps can be a helpful tool to ensure you don't miss any of the amazing phenomena associated with the eclipse. Just remember to always prioritize safety and enjoy the experience with clear skies and wide eyes.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/25/google-upgrade-samsung-s24-s23-pixel-towards-apple-iphone-15-pro-max/,Google Suddenly Reveals Surprise Android Update That Beats iPhone,"Android and iPhone are constantly competing for users, and Google is determined to make Android more like iPhone. In recent updates, Google has focused on enhancing Android security, integrating WhatsApp calls into its phone dialer, and adding Apple passes to its wallet. Now, Google has taken it a step further by introducing a new feature that not only matches an existing iPhone feature but surpasses it.

Previously, I discussed Google's plan to include an emergency satellite service in Android, which would finally bring satellite SOS functionality to Android devices. This is a significant development for the safety and security of Android users. Unlike Apple's emergency SOS feature, which is only meant for emergencies, Google's offering allows users to expand their cellular accounts to include a satellite add-on. This means that core messaging apps can now utilize satellite networks, eliminating the problem of cellular black-spots and ensuring connectivity even in remote areas.

According to Mishaal Rahman, Android 15 DP2 introduces UI elements to provide a consistent user experience for devices that support satellite connectivity. The update also includes a new API that allows apps to detect when a device is connected to a satellite. Additionally, Android 15 enables SMS/MMS/RCS apps to utilize satellite connectivity for sending and receiving messages. This is a major breakthrough and opens up a world of possibilities for Android users.

While Apple also offers satellite connectivity, their capabilities are more limited. With certain iPhone models, users can connect to a satellite to text emergency services, request roadside assistance, and share their location with friends and family when there is no mobile or Wi-Fi coverage. However, Android might go even further, as beta code suggests a potential satellite messaging option in partnership with T-Mobile. Recent tests by SpaceX have shown promising results, with unmodified Galaxy S21 Ultra achieving download speeds of 17mbps through satellite connectivity.

The integration of satellite messaging in Android 15 is a significant development that brings Android and iPhone closer together. It seems that Google is taking the lead, with Apple likely to follow suit. This news comes shortly after the announcement that Gemini, a powerful AI tool, might be coming to iPhone, further narrowing the gap between the two operating systems. This week has been filled with interesting developments in the world of smartphones.

In conclusion, Google's latest update for Android, featuring satellite messaging capabilities, is a game-changer. It not only matches but surpasses Apple's existing satellite functionality. Android users can now expand their cellular accounts to include a satellite add-on and utilize core messaging apps through satellite networks. This development brings us closer to a future where direct-to-phone satellite connectivity becomes the norm. With Android leading the way, it's only a matter of time before Apple follows suit. Exciting times lie ahead for smartphone users as technology continues to evolve.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65d79ec3dadcd6b682668331/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 00:06:15,Innovation,Innovation

It's Monday, and we're back to the work week, dear Wordlers! Can you believe it's already the last week of March? Time flies when you're having fun with puzzle games!

This past weekend has been quite odd. Just as we were entering sunny and lovely spring, it decided to surprise us with half a foot of snow. It's cold and wintry, and although I was looking forward to warmer weather, I must admit that it's quite pretty outside.

But enough about the weather, let's get back to work and Wordling! Are you ready? Let's do this!

Today's Wordle Hint and Clue

Hint: Normally, we think of this as a proper noun.
Clue: Today's Wordle has a double letter.

Spoiler alert! If you don't want to know the answer, skip ahead!

The Answer: [INSERT ANSWER HERE]

Wordle Analysis

Every day, I check Wordle Bot to see how I did. If you want to check your Wordles, you can do so with Wordle Bot right here.

I have to admit, this one had me quite confused. Things didn't start off well, and I was left with a cumbersome 195 possible solutions after the first trade. Even after trying ""Boink,"" I was still struggling with 40 options.

However, my guess of ""Allay"" turned out to be a good one. It revealed that there was more than one 'L' and left me with just one word remaining. I almost went with ""palsy"" before realizing I needed a second 'L.' After brainstorming for a bit, I finally settled on ""sally,"" which I usually think of as a name. But it's also an antiquated term for a battle tactic.

Competitive Wordle Score

Once again, it's a wash. No points for guessing in four or tying the Bot. Just a big, fat zero. Better luck next time!

Today's Wordle Etymology

The word ""sally,"" when used in a non-proper noun context, primarily means to suddenly rush forth or make a sudden attack from a defensive position. It can also mean to set out on a journey or venture. The etymology of ""sally"" in this context is quite interesting, tracing back through several languages before arriving in English.

The term comes from the Middle French word ""sallie,"" which is the noun form of ""sallir,"" meaning ""to rush out, leap forth."" ""Sallir"" itself originates from the Latin word ""salire,"" meaning ""to leap."" This Latin root has given rise to various related words in English, such as ""salient"" (prominently projecting) and ""assail"" (to attack), reflecting the idea of movement or leaping forth.

Therefore, the etymology of ""sally"" reflects the action of moving out or leaping forth, often with a sense of suddenness or unexpectedness. This applies to both physical attacks from a fortified position and embarking on a journey or new venture.
