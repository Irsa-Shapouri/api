Previously, the chatbot was only accessible to those on the higher-end tier, Premium+. However, Musk revealed that it will now be offered to Premium subscribers as well, in an effort to compete with other chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude.

This move comes at a time when X is experiencing a decline in usage and struggling to retain its existing users. Recent data from Sensor Tower indicates that X's usage in the U.S. has dropped by 18% since last year and 23% since Musk acquired the company. Additionally, 75 of the top 100 U.S. advertisers on X in October 2022 no longer allocate their ad budget to the platform, potentially affecting the company's revenue prospects.

By providing access to an AI chatbot like Grok, X hopes to prevent its users from migrating to alternative platforms such as decentralized platforms like Mastodon and Bluesky, or Instagram's Threads. These platforms have gained popularity, with Instagram's Threads boasting over 130 million monthly users as of the fourth quarter of 2023, thanks to the resources provided by Meta.

Although Musk did not specify an exact release date for Grok, he did mention that it would be enabled for all Premium subscribers sometime during the current week. The Premium subscription is X's mid-tier offering, priced at $8 per month on the web or $84 per year. Previously, Grok was exclusively available to Premium+ subscribers, who paid $16 per month or $168 per year.

Grok's appeal lies in its ability to respond to questions about typically off-limits topics for other AI chatbots, including conspiracies and controversial political ideas. Musk has described Grok as having a ""rebellious streak"" and it has access to real-time X data, a feature that sets it apart from its competitors.

However, the value of this data may be diminishing under Musk's leadership if X continues to lose users.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/xAI-Grok-GettyImages-1765893916.jpeg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-26 22:19:50,Innovation,Innovation
