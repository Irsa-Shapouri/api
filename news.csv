Social media is an indispensable tool for businesses to engage with target audiences, monitor competitors, identify trends and drive product sales. But it is also full of so-called anomalies—neutral phenomena such as user behavior patterns and trending discussions, along with negative phenomena such as hate speech, scams and cybersecurity threats.
Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have revolutionized anomaly detection, replacing the labor-intensive manual approach with more efficient methods. Now, businesses can perform anomaly detection faster and more efficiently by:
• Automating monitoring and analysis
• Processing vast amounts of data
• Detecting anomalies in near real time
• Achieving unmatched accuracy in the anomaly detection process
AI and ML algorithms can also assist you in social media analysis. With the help of AI-powered solutions, you can detect various anomalies in different types of content, including text, images and videos. When analyzed carefully, this data can be a source of security-related information for businesses by recognizing objects, segmenting and classifying images and searching for patterns. For example, Facebook uses AI models to detect and mitigate hate speech, and the US Army uses predictive machine learning models for detecting cyber anomalies.
Since my company specializes in cybersecurity, I have seen many cases where analysis of events, trends or deviations in user behavior helped strengthen a client’s security defenses and boosted the overall cybersecurity posture. The results of the social media analysis can be used for mitigating risks, extracting valuable insights from visual data and enhancing decision-making.
5 Things to Pay Attention To When Building An AI-Powered Anomaly Detection Solution
In order to truly unlock the potential of boosting cybersecurity with anomaly detection, it’s important to put AI and ML algorithms at the heart of the system. Whether it’s used for analyzing unusual posts, evaluating the trustworthiness of social media accounts or dissecting specific types of anomalies, AI has boundless capabilities when combined with human expertise.
There are several key challenges you’ll need to navigate while building an AI-powered anomaly detection tool for your business:
1. Ensuring Quality Datasets For Anomaly Detection
Anomaly detection algorithms require a precise, consistent, valid and well-balanced dataset to effectively identify any inconsistencies. To create such a dataset, your team will need to gather tons of relevant data, properly label it and, most importantly, precisely define the parameters of what constitutes normal and abnormal data. Otherwise, the AI system might end up marking trivial events as anomalies, bombarding your specialists with lots of false positives.
2. Dealing With Bias In Anomaly Detection Algorithms
As with any technical innovation, AI solutions cannot be completely bias-free. These solutions inherit imprints from several sources. First of all, bias can come from developers, including their experiences, mindsets and social backgrounds. Datasets used for AI training can introduce bias as well. As a result, your anomaly detection solution might be inaccurate, increasing the workload on your team or even discriminating against certain social groups.
To overcome this challenge, I recommend creating a balanced algorithm with diverse datasets so you can achieve a more equitable and objective approach to anomaly detection.
3. Considering The Price Of Cloud Hardware For Hosting Anomaly Detection Software
Hosting anomaly detection solutions in the cloud, such as through software as a service (SaaS), can provide scalability. At the same time, it might escalate costs if the software is not managed by experts who tune the algorithms so as not to take up too many resources. Effective cost control includes defining the scope of monitored social media content and optimizing AI anomaly detection algorithms to focus solely on tasks that require intelligent processing.
4. Protecting User Privacy When Hunting Anomalies
Currently, there are have no specific regulations tailored to AI-powered business tools. An anomaly detection solution will navigate through, process and store information on detected anomalies. If that information contains sensitive data, you must adhere to both local and international compliance requirements, such as the GDPR and PCI DSS, that control the storage and processing of such data.
5. Covering The Need For Niche Anomaly Detection Expertise
Creating an effective AI solution for social media anomaly detection often demands a diverse team with niche expertise in various fields. A ready-made dataset that perfectly aligns with the specific needs of your business is impossible to find. Your team will have to create such a dataset on their own, gathering data from scratch or reworking one or several existing datasets. This usually requires domain-specific knowledge not every developer has.
Building a brand-new dataset is typically expensive in terms of both time and money. That’s why developers in my company first look through available datasets to see if any can be used as the basis for a new one. Sometimes, to achieve the required volume and quality for a dataset, developers also generate synthetic data.
You might need to spend extra resources to enhance your team with an expert in AI or delegate this task to a software development outsourcing company with relevant experience.
AI can revolutionize anomaly detection, enhancing your business’s cybersecurity and improving your social media analysis. I believe that an AI-based anomaly detection system can’t entirely replace the insights and expertise of human specialists, even with its numerous benefits. Instead, it serves as a powerful addition to an expert cybersecurity team, streamlining data collection and assisting with preliminary analysis.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2023/10/18/why-professional-services-firms-must-prioritize-their-erp-foundation/,Why Professional Services Firms Must Prioritize Their ERP Foundation,"By Effie Calandra, Solution Director of Cloud ERP, SAP
Midsize professional services firms are inherently rich in data. They capture and maintain volumes of customer information and have large volumes of data on their employees, project history, and business outcomes. And in nearly every case, this business intelligence holds insights that can shift and amplify firms’ future success.
According to the SAP video “Everything as a Service: Innovation in Growth-Focused Professional Services Companies,” IDC research revealed that midsize firms plan to use their customer data to enhance business models to improve their offerings and drive growth.
According to IDC cross-industry research, 92% of midsize companies experiencing notable revenue and market-share growth have either adopted or plan to implement enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. getty
Unfortunately, many firms are not set up to gain this competitive advantage. In most cases, they exchange information cross-departmentally by manually compiling all requested data into a spreadsheet or report. This common practice increases the risk of using outdated data that may need to be aligned, contain errors from manual merging, and leverage unstandardized structures.
An urgent need for trusted data
Midsize professional services firms have the natural agility to respond efficiently and productively to industry changes and their specific needs. But they are also learning that today’s global momentum in ERP adoption drives a significant shift in their business.

According to IDC cross-industry research, 92% of midsize companies experiencing notable revenue and market-share growth have either adopted or plan to implement enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. However, adoption among professional services firms is not as robust – falling behind at 74%.
As the video guest speaker, Katie Evans, research director of IDC’s worldwide small and medium business research program, points out, “The way to improve the customer experience and meet expectations is to leverage data. When firms use data to better understand their customers, they can improve their services.”
But without an ERP foundation that delivers high-quality data, firms cannot accurately sense how their competitive landscape is changing, detect shifts in customer demand and expectations, and mitigate emerging risks early. And more important, they cannot effectively help employees build an elaborate set of skills that accelerate and increase their value to customers.
Evans advises firms: “Take a hard look at your offerings and see that you are meeting customers on their terms, not yours. Using data to inform offerings and better meet customer needs, migrating to the service-based approach that charges based on results and not time, and using bite-size increments are more approachable ways for customers to use your services to adapt and understand.”
Great data comes from a single view
When data is automatically captured and consolidated, accessible in real time, and analyzed in a standard format within a single source, departments have the complete visibility and accurate insights they need to know how they’re connected. They can figure out the best way to partner with each other, boost their contribution to the business, and develop and support their workforce.
MORE FROM FORBES SAP BrandVoice: Making ERP A True System Of Intelligence In The Cloud
Evans adds, “Since they’re typically more agile and can test, iterate, and innovate more quickly than larger enterprises, firms can also open themselves up to new delivery models services that may have been slower and complicated to create, deliver, and adapt.”
Take Rizing, for example. The services firm adopted cloud ERP and integrated it with various systems, including accounting, customer relationship management, project management, and time sheeting. Now, the firm has the foundation to streamline operations, enhance its business performance, and stay ahead of the competition.
The reason behind Rizing’s digital transformation success is the creation of a consistent, single source of truth. Using the cloud ERP, the firm is closing financials 12 days faster, targeting customer demand more appropriately, and driving more-meaningful metrics and performance.
A pivotal shift in business focus
As indicated by IDC’s research, adopting ERP and embracing data-driven strategies are positioning midsize professional services firms toward ongoing growth and people-centric transformation. These firms are not only enhancing their operational efficiency, but also elevating the quality of services they offer, which ultimately helps drive them to a more prosperous future.

[+] funds for a new deluxe edition. Mythworks
Role playing games like Dungeons & Dragons offer plenty of opportunities for their characters to do amazing things. These heroes can slay dragons, hack the planet and save the day. But only one game allows them to do a kickflip over a quantum centipede.
Slugblaster casts players as rebellious teenagers with access to technology that would make Einstein weep with jealousy. The kids use this power for the important stuff like skating through dimensional portals, showing off their skill with a particle accelerator to impress their crush and hoping multiverses like subway stops. The game contrasts these fantastic moments of adventure with the mundane aspects of teenage life like clashing with parents and pushing boundaries.
“I wanted to explore teenagehood,” said Mikey Hamm, designer of Slugblaster. “My own, and universally. I also like monsters and lasers. I imagined a setting where I could have both, realizing that teenagers are drawn to danger, and that if there were portals to dangerous worlds, a new subculture / action sport would naturally form around it. I then just imagined all that would lead to. Worried parent groups, moral panic, corporate sponsorships, all that. This had all been germinating in my head for the last decade. I wrote some short stories and drafted a novel, but eventually decided it would work best as a game.”
The system takes inspirations from Blades In The Dark and Apocalypse World. Players make rolls that can provide full successes, mixed successes or misses. The rules encourage a cooperative style where players build on each others successes and suggest the consequences of their failure.
There have been a few games that have dug into these themes. Recent entries include Tales From The Loop and Kids On Bikes, both of which rode a wave of popularity thanks to Stranger Things. Like their inspiration, they also trade on nostalgia, but Slugblaster aims for more of an idealized teenage experience that appeals to every generation.
“While all these games are great for exploring coming-of-age stories, teenage drama, and nostalgia, Slugblaster focuses on action adventures, not mystery-solving adventures. Slugblaster is also not specifically nostalgic, unlike Tales from the Loop (a game I love). Slugblaster has a nostalgic aesthetic, but it takes place in a more modern-feeling mish-mash decade. There's social media, for example.”
Curious gamers can check out the game right now. The current crowdfunding setup looks to create a deluxe print edition that puts a hardcover book into a boxed set inspired by pizza boxes. Dpending on the level backed, fans can get just the book, a boxed set with dice and maps or even a bonus fingerdeck to allow players to show off the sick tricks their characters pull off in the game.
“I love the new art,” said Hamm. “Hamburger Hands made us amazing psychedelic box art, and Sex on a Pizza has drawn these rich, highly-detailed locations for our poster maps. Yes, I am aware both my artists are named after fast food. This wasn't planned, but feels like fate.”
Slugblaster crowdfunds through October 26th, 2023. The physical product is currently slated for a Summer 2024 release.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/652fb2feb9fe63c7a9f57c6e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2023-10-18 07:01:17

It is leading the charge toward a more profitable and socially responsible future.
The Birth Of A Mission-Driven Corporate Venture Capital Firm
Madeline Lauf, founder and CEO of Begin Health Access VC, Reckitt's purpose-driven corporate venture capital arm
Access VC is Reckitt's three-year-old purpose-driven corporate venture capital arm—best known in the U.S. for its Lysol and Durex brands. Reckitt is a global company focused on health, hygiene, and nutrition.
Throughout venture capital’s history, it has been focused, for the most part, on financial returns, leading the sector to be dominated by men with elite backgrounds. Many founders, especially women, are also focused on social impact as well as returns. Access VC is focused on underserved markets at the intersection of health, hygiene, and nutrition. Often, these products address conditions that are stigmatized by the public, such as bladder control, incontinence and sexual wellness.
“We noticed that many companies that we wanted to invest in were B Corps,” said Charlotte Schofield, venture director at Access VC. Access VC. “So we wanted to be held to the same standards that they were being held to.”
B Corps are for-profit companies that have been certified by B Lab to meet high standards of social and environmental performance. They use the power of business to create a more inclusive and sustainable economy. Companies complete a rigorous assessment process on their impact on stakeholders.
With over 4,000 B Corps in 70 countries, they set an example of being both profitable and socially responsible. Companies such as Patagonia, Seventh Generation, and Ben & Jerry's are signaling to consumers and investors that they are committed to social and environmental responsibility. B Corp is not just a certification, it's a movement that also includes Kapor Capital, Obvious Ventures, Social Capital, and Access VC.
It took Access VC nearly two years to become B Corp certified. During that time, Access VC discovered where it was doing well and where it needed improvement. “We got so many people involved,” said Schofield. Legal and finance were involved, but the CVC also sought advice from its portfolio companies that are or are becoming B Corps.
More Than Just Funding: How Access VC is Speeding Success

Access VC invests worldwide, with the greatest concentration of companies in Europe and the U.S. Access VC-backed companies have access to Reckitt’s R&D, resources, research facilities, and consumer insights. To date, it has invested more than $50 million in over 30 startups, from pre-seed, to Series C and beyond. Twelve are part of its portfolio, and the others are pre-seed startups that have participated in the Founder Factory accelerator, which is backed by market-leading corporations. It invests in companies that are fighting for access to better health, hygiene, and nutrition in critically overlooked and stigmatized categories such as sextech and menopause, among others.
Portfolio companies include
Begin Health: prebiotics for constipated kids
Future Method: anal care for all genders constipation)
Jude: clinically proven supplements that reduce the urge to wee
Maude: sexual wellness for all people
As a relatively new corporate venture capital firm, it had to build a reputation in the startup community as a value-added investor. “Corporate venture capitalists have a reputation as being slow and not adding value,” said Schofield. “We are a completely separate entity with our board and decision-making process enabling us to act quickly. We have a 100-day process from meeting founders to investment.”
Their portfolio companies have diverse founders:
38% of companies have a female founder compared to 20.1% of U.S. companies that received VC as of September 30, 2023, according to PitchBook.
23% have a solo female founder compared to 2.2% of U.S. companies that received VC.
28% have a BIPOC founder, no data is available,
Access VC is building a reputation as transparent and approachable, effective at opening doors to strategic partnerships and media opportunities, helpful in addressing regulatory issues and packaging designs, well connected and able to make introductions to vendors, such as PR and marketing firms and third-party logistics companies, quick on approval processes, and unafraid to support taboo conversations such as sexual health and wellness.

It is a well-established fact that putting your customers at the center of everything you do is directly proportional to long-term relationships and business success. But is it really?
Is the customer-first approach always good for your business?
Well, that’s what I’m going to dive deep into today to help you understand the economics of a customer-first business approach. But before I get into the nitty-gritty, let’s understand what a customer-first business approach really means.
What A Customer-First Business Approach Means
Customer-first means your business puts the needs and expectations of your customers first above everything else. Here, the customers are at the center of the technology solution you build and are a quintessential part of the decision-making process.
It's a fundamental shift in perspective where customers are not just the end users of your products or services but the driving force behind your entire business strategy. This also involves continuously seeking ways to deliver an exceptional customer experience by designing and developing tech solutions tailored to them.
The customer-first approach is purpose-driven; delivering a positive experience becomes the company’s sole purpose. Even the employees and customer support teams have only one goal, and it is to deliver good customer service whenever possible.
A customer-first business approach is a philosophy that recognizes that by consistently delivering value and exceptional experiences to your customers, you not only secure their loyalty but also set your business up for sustained growth and success in a competitive marketplace.
Benefits Of Adopting A Customer-First Business Approach
Keeping your customers happy and turning them into promoters of your brand gets rewarded. According to Harvard Business Review, Fred Reichheld, the creator of the Net Promoter System, ""had his 'aha!' about earned growth while studying an investor presentation slide in preparation for a keynote at First Republic Bank’s executive conference. ... The slide showed that existing customers accounted for 50% of the growth in deposit balances, and referred customers another 32%"" (paywall).
Venturing into a journey about your brand’s image and showcasing it as customer-first surely offers several advantages besides growth. Here are a few.
• Customers who have had a positive experience with your brand may make purchases more often, leading to positive customer retention.
• Customer-first tech companies may see reduced churn as they can promptly understand and address the pain points of their customers.
• Businesses that prioritize customers likely increase their reputation, gaining a competitive edge to stand out from the rest of the competition.
• By prioritizing the customers’ needs, you are naturally inclined to come up with tech solutions that truly solve a problem. Customers are often the best source of inspiration for innovation.
• A customer-first business approach adorns you with valuable insights such as user behavior, preferences and trends to make strategic decisions that align with customer needs.
Pitfalls Of The Customer-First Business Approach
A customer-first business approach is a commitment to making your customers not just the focus but the driving force of your business. This essentially translates to your business’s excessive dependence on customers rather than focusing on your products or services.
Thus, it can have severe consequences on your business’s profitability and growth. Let me present my case. I’ve been a founder-CEO of a technology company long enough to understand the importance of getting recognized as a customer-first tech company.
Although we had successfully instituted various processes and solutions aimed at enhancing the convenience of our customers, we encountered a situation where specific segments of our customer base began to exploit our business practices.
Consequently, we found it imperative to institute essential reforms to our software product, aligning it with pertinent regulations that, while not explicitly labeled as ""customer-first,"" were fundamentally intended to enhance end-user convenience and elevate the overall ecosystem.
Here are a few more pitfalls of a customer-first business approach.
• Being customer-first is commendable; however, you can easily get trapped into constantly adding new features requested by customers, which leads to scope creep and loss of focus on your product’s core strength.
• While catering to individual customer needs is important, over-optimization and customization can lead to product bloat and operational inefficiencies.
• The adage “The customer is always right” may not be true most of the time because there are customers who vehemently claim they were wronged by brands and those claims can’t be verified, leading to damage to your reputation.
• When scaling your business, it becomes a challenge to maintain the same level of personalization and responsiveness with your customers.
Striking The Right Balance
There’s no doubt that customer-first is a pivotal strategy for any technology-led company’s success. However, it’s essential to strike the right balance between meeting your customers’ needs and maintaining a sustainable business model.
As a founder-CEO, I’ve come to realize that a customer-first business approach isn’t a one-size-fits-all strategy and requires refinements along the way. And that’s what we’ve done by implementing necessary reforms that improved our company's overall bottom line while making it effortless for our customers to get through them.
Similarly, by staying attentive to customer needs, remaining agile and being mindful of potential pitfalls, you can harness the full potential of a customer-centric business model while avoiding the traps that can hinder your growth.

Elevance Health reported a third quarter profit of $1.29 billion as the health insurer added new customers despite a big dip in Medicaid enrollment due to the end of a pandemic-era coverage provision.
Elevance, which sells government and commercial health insurance including Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in 14 states, Wednesday reported third quarter profits decreased nearly 20% to $1.29 billion compared to $1.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. The dip in net income was due largely to an “operating loss of $741 million in the company’s “corporate & other segment” executives said was driven by “business optimization charges.”
“In the third quarter, we completed a strategic review of our operations, assets, and investments to enhance operating efficiency, refine the focus of our investments in innovation and optimize our physical footprint,” the company said in its earnings report. “This resulted in a net charge of $697 million, comprised of the write-off of certain information technology assets and contract exit costs, a reduction in staff including the relocation of certain job functions, and the impairment of assets associated with the closure or partial closure of data centers and offices.”
Still, revenue jumped 7% to $42.8 billion as overall health plan enrollment grew and the company’s Carelon health services business performed well.
Elevance’s membership grew by 42,000, or 0.1%, to 47.3 million as of September 30, 2023 compared to a year ago.
The growth was driven primarily by “growth in BlueCard, Affordable Care Act health plans, and Medicare Advantage membership, partially offset by attrition in Medicaid due to the resumption of eligibility redeterminations and a new entrant into one of our state Medicaid programs in the third quarter, as well as declines in our Employer Group risk-based business,” Elevance said in its third quarter earnings report.
The end of the U.S. Public Health Emergency in May after three years of the Covid-19 pandemic is impacting health insurers that have a significant business administering Medicaid coverage for states, which are conducting so-called “Medicaid redeterminations.” Medicaid redetermination, also described as Medicaid renewal or Medicaid recertification, is essentially when people are asked to show they are qualified for such coverage.
“During the third quarter of 2023, medical membership decreased by 664 thousand driven by attrition in Medicaid due to the aforementioned dynamics,” Elevance said in its report.
Still, Elevance’s profits and continued growth are figured in the company’s forecast for increased profits with adjusted net income now expected to be “greater than $33.00 per share.” That is more than an earlier forecast for adjusted net income of company “greater than $32.85” per share.
“Elevance Health delivered another quarter of solid performance reflecting the strength and balance of our diversified portfolio of businesses, our continued investments in innovation and growth, and our relentless focus on affordability, simplicity, and customer experience,” said Elevance Health president and chief executive Gail K. Boudreaux. “With affordability a paramount concern for all payors and a more uncertain forward-looking operating environment, we took action during the third quarter that will enhance our ability to act nimbly and operate efficiently.”",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/634fd98138f2f6f4c4c9a291/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2023-10-18 06:45:46

In today’s rapidly evolving business landscape, technology leadership has emerged as a pivotal factor in driving organizational success. The boardroom, traditionally a strategic hub for decision-making, must now embrace technology leadership to navigate the complexities and opportunities of the digital frontier. In this era of digital transformation, harnessing the power of technology is not just a business strategy; it’s a mandate for sustainable growth and competitive advantage.
The Imperative For Technology Leadership
Technology leadership is no longer confined to IT departments; it is now a core responsibility of the entire leadership team, with the board of directors playing a crucial role. As technology becomes intertwined with every aspect of business operations, board members are tasked with understanding its potential impact, guiding strategic decisions, and ensuring that their organizations remain agile and adaptable in the face of technological disruptions.
There are several key themes emerging in technology leadership conversations in the boardroom. Possibly the most significant is that the heart of effective technology leadership rests in strategic alignment. Boards must foster a deep understanding of how technology can enable business strategies and create new opportunities. This requires not only recognizing the value of emerging technologies but also identifying how they can be harnessed to enhance customer experiences, streamline operations and drive innovation. Boards should actively engage in discussions that bridge the gap between technology initiatives and overarching business goals, ensuring a cohesive and forward-looking strategy.
My personal experience demonstrates the value of immersing the board in practical use cases of how technology can be applied in the organization. I have found that working with strategic industry partners can often unlock new applications of technology. For example, in financial services, applying AI to AML and KYC processes is a good example of utilizing the latest technology in practical applications.
Risk Management And Cybersecurity
With the increasing reliance on technology comes a heightened need for robust risk management and cybersecurity practices. Boards must be well-versed in the potential risks associated with technology, ranging from data breaches to regulatory compliance issues. Effective technology leadership involves overseeing the development of comprehensive cybersecurity frameworks, monitoring threats and ensuring that adequate measures are in place to protect both the organization and its stakeholders.
I have found that remaining up to date with cybersecurity practices often involves selecting experts and niche organizations to provide a refresh on the latest developments and best practices. It is good to have a robust level of cyber expertise within the organization as a core capability.
Innovation And Digital Transformation
Technology leadership goes beyond managing risk; it extends to fostering innovation and driving digital transformation. Boards should encourage a culture of innovation that embraces experimentation and rewards creative thinking. Executive leaders must guide the organization through the process of digital transformation, which involves not only adopting new technologies but also reimagining business processes, models and customer interactions. This requires visionary leadership that balances short-term goals with long-term strategic vision.
A good way to explore innovation is to learn from adjacent industries and applications around the globe. For example, the U.S., European and Asian markets offer learnings tied into their respective local marketplaces—though, often the innovations are linked through different models of value creation at the core of the innovation developments.
Collaboration Between IT And Business
Effective technology leadership hinges on fostering collaboration between IT departments and the broader business functions. Boards should encourage open communication channels that facilitate the exchange of ideas and insights between these teams. By breaking down silos and fostering cross-functional collaboration, organizations can accelerate the implementation of technology initiatives and ensure that they align with strategic objectives. Setting up digitization initiatives in an enterprise model is often a good way to foster collaboration and share knowledge.
Customer-Centricity And Data Utilization
One of the hallmarks of technology leadership is the ability to leverage data for informed decision-making and improved customer experiences. Boards must prioritize data-driven insights that enhance customer understanding, enabling organizations to tailor products and services to evolving preferences. Effective technology leadership involves facilitating the responsible collection, analysis, and utilization of data, ensuring that it aligns with ethical and regulatory standards.
Building a core team of data experts central to the organization often enhances data practices in an accelerated way. The latest techniques in data analysis require a continual investment in analytical and coding capabilities. This is recommended to be factored into conversations on deepening organizational growth so the right level of investment is provided to the teams on the ground.
Talent Development And Upskilling
In the pursuit of technology leadership, boards should recognize the significance of a skilled and adaptable workforce. As technology reshapes job roles and demands new skill sets, boards must champion talent development initiatives. This involves investing in continuous learning, upskilling and reskilling programs that empower employees to thrive in a technology-driven environment. By nurturing a tech-savvy workforce, organizations can remain at the forefront of innovation and maintain a competitive edge. In today’s competitive world for talent, building collaborative vendor relationships with technology firms can often unlock additional levels of organizational expertise.
Application-based organizations have grown from this central understanding of how a technology platform can be transformed into a service (e.g., Amazon and Uber).
In the contemporary boardroom, technology leadership is not an option—it’s an imperative. Embracing technology as a fundamental driver of growth and innovation requires commitment from every board member and executive leader.

October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and public health professionals dedicate their efforts this month in promoting mammogram screening for women in an effort to save as many lives as possible from breast cancer. Although breast cancer is often perceived as a female disease, men also can get breast cancer. Here is what you should know.
How Common Is Male Breast Cancer?
For American women, after some types of skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed. According to the American Cancer Society, a woman’s lifetime risk in developing breast cancer sometime in her life is 13%, or a one in eight chance. For men, the lifetime risk of getting breast cancer is one in 833.
Only one out of every 100 diagnosed breast cancers occur in a man, according to the CDC. To put this into perspective, nearly 298,000 cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in women this year, compared to just 2,800 in men, according to the American Cancer Society.
Men can get breast cancer because males also possess breast tissue; which includes milk ducts, glands, and nipples; locations where breast cancer can occur. Females typically grow much more breast tissue than men, particularly after puberty.
Risk Factors For Male Breast Cancer
Many of the factors that predispose men to breast cancer are similar to those for women. For example, a positive family history of breast cancer, increased age and certain genetic mutations such as BRCA1/BRCA2 can increase one’s risk of breast cancer, regardless of one’s sex. Also, conditions that increase one’s estrogen levels such as obesity and liver disease can also increase the risk of getting breast cancer in both men and women.
Risks factors unique to men include having previous inflammation to the testicles, surgical removal of the testicles, or being born with more than one X chromosome, a condition known as Klinefelter Syndrome.
What Are The Signs And Symptoms Of Male Breast Cancer?
Symptoms for breast cancer are largely the same for men and women. These include feeling a lump in your breast, any discharge from the nipple, changes to the nipple such as scaling or the nipple turning inward and redness or flaky skin in the breast. Although some of these symptoms can occur without the presence of cancer, you should make an appointment with your doctor if you see or experience any of those symptoms.
How Is Male Breast Cancer Diagnosed And Treated?
Both men and women usually undergo the same diagnostic tests when trying to identify breast cancer. For example, men or women who feel a lump in their breast will usually go on to get a mammogram, which are low-dose x-ray images geared toward detecting any abnormalities in the breast such as suspicious masses or lesions.

If an abnormality is present on a mammogram, additional studies and procedures could include an ultrasound, MRI or even a biopsy to confirm a specific diagnosis.
As for women, treatment for male breast cancer can vary depending on the size of the tumor, the extent to which it has spread in the body and whether the cancer is sensitive to certain hormones. Treatment can include a variety of strategies which include surgical removal of a lump, surgical removal of the entire breast, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy or a combination of these.
Differences Between Male And Female Breast Cancer And Challenges Unique To Men
There are racial differences with respect to how common breast cancer is for both males and females. According to the American Cancer Society, in America, White women are slightly more likely to develop breast cancer when compared to Black women. However, for males, breast cancer incidence rates are 52% higher for Black men compared to White men.
The risk of breast cancer increases with age for both males and females, but men on average are diagnosed with breast cancer later than females. The average age of a woman diagnosed with breast cancer is 62, but is 68 for a man.
Because breast cancer is diagnosed at an older age for men compared to women, the cancer can present at a more advanced stage and can lead to poor outcomes. This challenge can be compounded by the fact that men are not screened for cancer, are often unaware of heralding symptoms of cancer and may ignore symptoms due to fear of emasculation. Furthermore, men may experience stigma in having to cope with a cancer that is often perceived as a cancer of women.
Dr. Cynthia Lynch, Medical Director of the Breast Cancer Center at CTCA Phoenix, states, “Given this is primarily a malignancy in women, studies have identified that men can feel isolated in their diagnosis.”
In an effort to ameliorate this stigma, spreading awareness on male breast cancer and its common symptoms should be a public health priority to ensure feelings of anxiety are alleviated.
Although rare, male breast cancer does exist and understanding it can help you identify it, should you or one of your loved ones be diagnosed with it.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/650ae93dd5b9fe7509bba909/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2000,3000,x0,y0,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2023-10-18 06:32:46

In an era of data, e-commerce and digital payments, B2C and B2B2C transactions have witnessed a transformative surge in customer experiences. Whether booking a cab, ordering a pizza or making a seamless payment through UPI, simplicity and convenience reign supreme.
However, the B2B (and B2B2B) sectors must catch up in delivering captivating customer experiences. Historically, these sectors have been slow to embrace technological innovations.
A significant reason for this gap lies in transactions. B2C transactions, like hailing a ride or ordering food, involve minimal paperwork or compliance requirements. On the other hand, B2B transactions revolve around complex business processes, necessitating extensive documentation.
Industries like manufacturing, shipping, import-export and B2B banking grapple with a large amount of paperwork related to logistics, transportation, insurance, invoicing, customs and payments. The process can take hours to weeks, depending on geographical factors and regulatory complexities.
The crux of the issue lies in the tedious and time-consuming nature of compliance-driven document processing, which hampers instant gratification for customers. Let's delve into trade documentation, which includes manual form-filling, error-prone data entry and precise tracking of shipped goods. Remarkably, even global logistics giants rely on antiquated manual processes, from my experience.
A Look At AI-Powered Intelligent Document Processing
Bank guarantees and letters of credit (LC), remittances, collections and other crucial elements of commercial banking involve submitting numerous documents that banks must scrutinize for compliance. This manual review process is both time-consuming and susceptible to errors and fraud.
These protracted delays and monotonous processes can compromise the customer experience in the B2B space. In light of this, many companies are turning to artificial intelligence to reduce document processing times from days to minutes while offering hyper-personalization tailored to specific industry sectors.
Solutions based on AI, machine learning (ML), neural networks and natural language processing (NLP) work within secure environments to scan, process, classify and extract unstructured and semi-structured data from various file formats including notes.
AI-powered document processing can understand clauses, identify critical fields and integrate with existing workflows. Eliminating manual data processing can help save time, minimize errors, enhance filing accuracy and ensure compliance.
Hyper-Personalization With IDP: Elevating B2B Customer Experiences
In today's data-driven world, AI-driven intelligent document processing (IDP) is improving B2B customer experiences across sectors. Here are some real-world areas we're seeing an impact.
• Corporate Banking: Utilizing AI-driven document processing can speed up the handling of vital corporate banking paperwork, including bank guarantees, letters of credit, remittances, collections, mortgages, current account documents, loan origination documents and more. This technology expedites ""know your customer"" (KYC) procedures for tailored onboarding and assesses financial information to enhance customized loan offerings, ultimately improving customer satisfaction.
• Global Trade: AI-powered document processing can streamline international trade documentation, meet country-specific requirements and provide real-time shipment tracking for proactive supply chain management.
• Insurance: Claims can be automated for faster settlements and paired with personalized policy recommendations, taking individual profiles into account to enhance trust.
• Corporations: AI-powered document processing automates invoice processing, simplifies import/export documentation and streamlines legal contract management, reducing hassles and making data retrieval easier.
Delivering Delightful Customer Experiences
The notion that ""charity begins at home"" holds true for crafting an engaging customer experience with AI-powered document processing as well. To begin their transformative voyage, B2B enterprises can implement these practical measures in-house.
• Assessing Your Document Landscape: Begin with a comprehensive assessment of existing document processes. Identify inefficiencies and prioritize areas where AI-powered document processing can make the most significant impact.
• Building A Data Team: Form a team of experts in data science, machine learning and document processing. If these skills still need to be improved, consider hiring or training to build the necessary capabilities.
• Cleansing And Normalizing Data: Invest in data cleansing and normalization for accurate extraction and processing. Clean, standardized data is vital.
• Ensuring Vendor Reliability, Scalability And Flexibility: Choose a reliable AI-powered document processing service provider aligned with your organization's needs. The provider should help you scale up as your business grows to handle increased document volumes. At the same time, the service provider needs to be flexible, as their technology should be adaptable to the existing workflow at the enterprise.
• Engaging IT And Security Teams: Involve IT and security teams to manage integration complexities and ensure security and compliance standards.
• Collaborating With Finance And Procurement: Justify the AI-powered document processing investment by collaborating with finance and procurement teams. Develop cost-benefit analyses and negotiate favorable contracts with vendors.
• Implementing A Pilot And Managing Change: Test the document processing system with a pilot implementation. Gather user feedback. Address employee concerns through training and change management.
• Improving Continuously: Establish a post-implementation framework for monitoring and improvement. Regularly evaluate performance and gather insights for optimization.
By following these steps and addressing potential challenges, organizations can harness AI-powered document processing to streamline tasks, enhance B2B customer experiences and create a more delightful journey. Just as ordering pizza online is simple and satisfying, B2B interactions can become equally seamless, making customers happier and more loyal.

But privacy experts are concerned about how such ease of use could lead to persistent surveillance.
O n a blistering day in southeast Houston, a small drone takes off and surveys the suburban landscape. From a high altitude, it can see people moving around in their yards. Flip on augmented reality mode, and it overlays a map showing street names and house numbers. Infrared reveals multicolored humans, dogs, some chickens in a backyard, all warm-blooded bodies in a cooler sea of vegetation and buildings. Zoom in on a lawn and you can see each sweating blade of grass — all from 5,000 miles away.
I’m controlling this drone from my house just west of London through software deployed in a Chrome browser, using just my patchy home wi-fi network. I can drive it using classic keyboard gaming controls, mimicking the experience of a first-person action game. But this is no simulation — each press of the keyboard and a drone almost halfway around the world reacts in half a second.
Early versions of Paladin's tech involved a lot of duct tape and some strapped-on phones. DIVY SHRIVASTAVA
The drone itself was built by DJI, but the software controlling it is made by Houston-based startup Paladin. Founded in 2018, the company sells a small piece of hardware that acts as the brain for any off-the-shelf drone, giving its police and first responder customers the ability to pilot the drone from anywhere using a standard internet connection. The software also offers automation features like gunshot detection and license plate readers that aim to help cops chase down leads without ever leaving the station.
“I could send you a link to one of our drones and you could be flying it with about a half a second latency from anywhere in the world,” said founder and CEO Divy Shrivastava, a 24-year-old who quit college to start Paladin.

The startup, along with much larger vendors like Skydio and DJI, is servicing a new craze amongst American cops: Drone as first responder, or DFR. Police departments in states like California, Georgia and New Jersey are testing out using drones as the first eyes on a crime scene or emergency, since they can often get there faster than a patrol officer. That’s thanks to new rules from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which now allows police and fire departments, as well as commercial users like construction companies, to fly drones without needing a pilot on the ground who has a line of sight.
Larry Boggus, an officer and pilot at the Memorial Villages Police Department in Houston who is using Paladin to fly drones, says he deploys them to protect his colleagues. When a physical altercation occurs while a cop is on the job, the drone’s operator can see what’s happening and call in backup. If they can’t see someone approaching from behind, the drone operator can warn them. And because Paladin’s software works from anywhere, Boggus said the operator could be states or even countries away. “I could be on a beach and launch it,” he told Forbes.
But while police officers expressed excitement about DFR programs like this, civil liberties organizations are concerned about the impact on privacy if there’s an explosion of drone use by police. At least 1,400 police departments across the U.S. are currently using drones, according to data collected by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and analysts at Teal Group predict the global civil government market, which includes public safety and border security, is going to hit nearly $140 billion over this decade.
“I don't think the American public really wants to live in a world with surveillance drones buzzing over their heads all day, capturing massive amounts of data and treating the entire population as a target,” said Dave Maass, the director of investigations at the EFF. He said Paladin’s system is especially concerning because it can combine a number of technologies, including gunshot detection, that have “a long rap sheet of problems and biases.” Previous reports have found that gunshot detection is often deployed in majority Black and Latino areas in the U.S. and that it can misclassify sounds such as fireworks as a firearm going off, potentially leading to wrongful arrests.
“If we don't create this industry responsibly, it won't grow.” Divi Shrivastava, founder and CEO of Paladin Technologies
Shrivastava said that Paladin has some built-in privacy protections to prevent pervasive surveillance. When its drones are flying, Paladin’s software ensures their cameras are focused on the horizon on their way to and from the scene of an emergency, minimizing any unnecessary privacy intrusions during the flight. Though cops can take manual control and effectively override that protection, everything on the drone is logged, meaning departments can check where the camera was pointing at any point of the flight, Shrivastava said. “We have very clear and strict policies around privacy and ethics on our website that we follow each day,” he told Forbes. “If we don't create this industry responsibly, it won't grow.”
Boggus says he’s tried to reduce anxiety about drones in his community by regularly taking drones to public events like Boy Scout functions and farmers markets to bolster public understanding of the technology. Rather than deploy aircraft from secretive locations, his department launches from a pod right outside the front of its building and every flight log can be accessed by the public. “Fear of not knowing is not an issue anymore,” Boggus told Forbes.
S hrivastava’s interest in drones in emergency situations came after close calls with a series of fires. In summer 2016, he was about to head off to study engineering at Berkeley when a family friend’s house burnt down. Soon after he arrived in California, a church next to his campus was turned to cinders. And in his second semester, a warehouse fire in Oakland a few miles from his dorm killed several people during a music festival.
Shrivastava began speaking with firefighters about what tools they could use to help them put out flames faster. One major issue was that when people dialed 911, they didn’t know exactly where a fire was and would report inaccurate locations, “from being on the wrong block to being on the other side of the highway,” Shrivastava said.
He’d tinkered with drones at Berkeley, believing they might provide a solution. After Shrivastava dropped out of college to start Paladin, it was accepted into the Y Combinator accelerator in 2018. That same year, Shrivastava received a Thiel Fellowship, which includes a grant of $100,000 and access to mentorship from founders and investors working with the organization (billionaire Peter Thiel, the organization’s founder, has long invested in surveillance tech from companies such as Palantir and facial recognition provider Clearview AI).
Paladin’s product line consists of two primary technologies. One is a fully-fledged drone, the Knighthawk. The second, more successful product is the add-on, called the EXT, which can be integrated with existing police drone fleets to add the remote web connectivity and software features. It has police customers across Texas, New Jersey and Colorado, who told Forbes they were able to deploy drones to an emergency or crime scene much faster, and across a much larger area.
The EXT drone add-on as it is today, much sleeker than the early versions. DIVY SHRIVASTAVA
“We can get eyes on the scene a lot faster than traditional [drones],” said Luis Figuerido, who leads the drone program from Elizabeth Police Department in New Jersey. Figuerido has connected his region’s license plate readers to his drone fleet, so unmanned vehicles can fly to the location of a suspect’s vehicle.
Shrivastava is planning to launch more autonomous features, including the ability for cops to give drones advanced instructions for given emergencies. For example, if there’s a missing person, the drone will scan a specific area for people and alert operators if it finds one. The drone can then follow that person until an officer arrives on scene to determine if it’s the person they’re looking for. And soon, when a cop tells the drone to fly home, it will land on a charging dock, eliminating the need to switch out the battery.
If Paladin and its rivals continue to expand their product suites, and more police agencies get permission from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones without needing to be near them, AI aircraft are likely to be hovering over Americans’ heads with increasing frequency. “The future is right around the corner,” said Boggus.

Now that improvements in technology mean that some robots work alongside humans, there is evidence that those humans have learned to see them as team-mates—and teamwork can have negative as well as positive effects on people's performance.
People sometimes relax, letting their colleagues do the work instead. This is called ""social loafing,"" and it's common where people know their contribution won't be noticed or they've acclimatized to another team member's high performance. Scientists at the Technical University of Berlin investigated whether humans social loaf when they work with robots.
""Teamwork is a mixed blessing,"" said Dietlind Helene Cymek, first author of the study in Frontiers in Robotics and AI. ""Working together can motivate people to perform well but it can also lead to a loss of motivation because the individual contribution is not as visible. We were interested in whether we could also find such motivational effects when the team partner is a robot.""
A helping hand
The scientists tested their hypothesis using a simulated industrial defect-inspection task: looking at circuit boards for errors. The scientists provided images of circuit boards to 42 participants. The circuit boards were blurred, and the sharpened images could only be viewed by holding a mouse tool over them. This allowed the scientists to track participants' inspection of the board.
Half of the participants were told that they were working on circuit boards that had been inspected by a robot called Panda. Although these participants did not work directly with Panda, they had seen the robot and could hear it while they worked. After examining the boards for errors and marking them, all participants were asked to rate their own effort, how responsible for the task they felt, and how they performed.
Looking but not seeing
At first sight, it looked as if the presence of Panda had made no difference—there was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of time spent inspecting the circuit boards and the area searched. Participants in both groups rated their feelings of responsibility for the task, effort expended, and performance similarly.
But when the scientists looked more closely at participants' error rates, they realized that the participants working with Panda were catching fewer defects later in the task, when they'd already seen that Panda had successfully flagged many errors. This could reflect a ""looking but not seeing"" effect, where people get used to relying on something and engage with it less mentally. Although the participants thought they were paying an equivalent amount of attention, subconsciously they assumed that Panda hadn't missed any defects.
""It is easy to track where a person is looking, but much harder to tell whether that visual information is being sufficiently processed at a mental level,"" said Dr. Linda Onnasch, senior author of the study.
Safety at risk?
The authors warned that this could have safety implications. ""In our experiment, the subjects worked on the task for about 90 minutes, and we already found that fewer quality errors were detected when they worked in a team,"" said Onnasch.
""In longer shifts, when tasks are routine and the working environment offers little performance monitoring and feedback, the loss of motivation tends to be much greater. In manufacturing in general, but especially in safety-related areas where double checking is common, this can have a negative impact on work outcomes.""
The scientists pointed out that their test has some limitations. While participants were told they were in a team with the robot and shown its work, they did not work directly with Panda. Additionally, social loafing is hard to simulate in the laboratory because participants know they are being watched.
""The main limitation is the laboratory setting,"" Cymek explained. ""To find out how big the problem of loss of motivation is in human-robot interaction, we need to go into the field and test our assumptions in real work environments, with skilled workers who routinely do their work in teams with robots.""

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:
X, formerly known as Twitter, is testing an annual $1 fee for basic features as an anti-spam measure.
The social media site X, formerly known as Twitter, said Tuesday it has started charging new users in New Zealand and the Philippines for basic features such as posting messages in a trial aimed at reducing spam.
Tech billionaire Elon Musk, who bought Twitter last year for $44 billion, has long complained about fake accounts, bots and spam on the platform, introducing a number of controversial changes that have been sharply criticized by users around the world.
Under the trial, named ""Not A Bot"", new users in New Zealand and the Philippines will have to pay an annual fee for the ability to write on X, like and reply to posts, and bookmark content.
""This new program aims to defend against bots and spammers who attempt to manipulate the platform and disrupt the experience of other X users,"" the company said on its website.
""It is not a profit driver,"" it said in a separate post on X. ""So far, subscription options have proven to be the main solution that works at scale.""
It added that existing users will not be affected by the model, which will cost around $0.75 per year for new users in the Philippines and $0.85 for those in New Zealand.
Those who decline to pay will be able to access X in read-only mode, limited to viewing content and following accounts, the company said.
""Anything that a platform does to protect their users from the harm they might experience is a step in the right direction,"" said NetSafe, an independent online safety charity in New Zealand.
""Whether trying to stop bots from contacting people indirectly, that might engage in harmful conversations, or taking steps to verify who its users are... those things are potentially useful in trying to reduce harm.""
But Jonathan de Santos, chair of the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, said this would limit participation.
""We get that the program is meant to curb the use of bots, but this also seems like putting the burden of fighting misinformation and disinformation on users,"" he said.
Musk in September suggested charging all X users, saying it was the only way to combat the spam and bots that plague the platform.
But the idea was widely panned by users. Industry analysts said it would make X even less appealing to advertisers.
After taking over the company, the billionaire sacked thousands of staff and drew criticism for allowing banned conspiracy theorists and extremists back on the platform, sending advertisers fleeing.
Musk said in July that X had lost roughly half its ad revenue.
A month earlier, he had claimed that almost all advertisers had returned and that 90 percent of bots had been removed.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:
Chairman of Foxconn Technology Group Young Liu (R) and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Taiwanese announced Wednesday they are building 'AI factories'
Taiwanese tech giant Foxconn and US hardware leader Nvidia said Wednesday they would team up to create ""AI factories"", powerful data processing centers that would drive the manufacturing of next-generation products such as electric cars.
The world's largest contract electronics maker, Foxconn—officially known as Hon Hai Technology Group—already plays a lynchpin role in assembling gadgets for top global brands, including Apple's iPhone.
But it has ambitions to diversify beyond electronics assembly—even embracing the competitive but rapidly expanding electric vehicle business by unveiling concept cars on its ""Hon Hai Tech Day"" in past years.
This year, chairman Young Liu opened the annual event with Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang to introduce a ""new class of data centers powering a wide range of applications"".
Silicon Valley-based Nvidia made its name developing graphics processing units (GPUs), a powerful chip technology that started as the backbone of modern video games—but has now become a crucial pillar in the rapid development of generative AI.
""Together we will be helping the whole industry move much faster into the new AI era,"" Liu announced onstage with Huang.
The ""factories"" would include ""digitalization of manufacturing and inspection workflows, development of AI-powered electric vehicle and robotics platforms, and a growing number of language-based generative AI services"", according to Nvidia.
Huang said Foxconn ""has the expertise and scale to build AI factories globally"".
If successful, Foxconn's customers could use these systems to deliver generative AI services and use simulation to train autonomous machines like industrial robots and self-driving cars.
The announcement Wednesday came a day after the United States unveiled tightening curbs on exports of state-of-the-art chips to China—the latest move to prevent Beijing's advances in cutting-edge tech, seen by Washington as a national security threat.
The ban would hit Nvidia's chips that had previously gone to China—a major supplier base for many contract electronics manufacturers, including Foxconn—and sent the company's share price plummeting on Wall Street on Tuesday.
Nvidia said the new rules by the US Department of Commerce may ""require the company to transition certain operations out of one or more of the identified countries"".

LONDON (Reuters) - A major cyber attack on a financial services payments system could lead to global losses of $3.5 trillion, with much of it not covered by insurance, commercial insurance market Lloyd’s of London said on Wednesday.
The United States would suffer losses of $1.1 trillion over a five-year period from such an attack, which would cause widespread disruption to global business, according to a systemic risk scenario developed by Lloyd’s and the Cambridge Centre for Risk Studies.
China would face $470 billion in losses and Japan $200 billion over the same period, Lloyd’s said.
“The global interconnectedness of cyber means it is too substantial a risk for one sector to face alone and therefore we must continue to share knowledge, expertise and innovative ideas across government, industry and the insurance market to ensure we build society’s resilience against the potential scale of this risk,” Lloyd’s chairman Bruce Carnegie-Brown said.
Cyber insurance saw over $9 billion in gross written premiums in 2022 and is forecast to grow to $13 billion to $25 billion by 2025, Lloyd’s said.
Concern about the cost of such insurance and whether it will provide cover in the case of war are deterring some potential customers, brokers say.

The officials from the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - known as the Five Eyes intelligence sharing network - made the comments following meetings with private companies in the U.S. innovation hub Silicon Valley.
U.S. FBI Director Christopher Wray said the “unprecedented” joint call was meant to confront the “unprecedented threat” China poses to innovation across the world.
From quantum technology and robotics to biotechnology and artificial intelligence, China was stealing secrets in various sectors, the officials said.
“China has long targeted businesses with a web of techniques all at once: cyber intrusions, human intelligence operations, seemingly innocuous corporate investments and transactions,” Wray said. “Every strand of that web had become more brazen, and more dangerous.”
In response, Chinese government spokesman Liu Pengyu said the country was committed to intellectual property protection.
“We firmly oppose to the groundless allegations and smears towards China and hope the relevant parties can view China’s development objectively and fairly,” the spokesperson for China’s embassy in Washington said in a statement to Reuters.
The U.S. has long accused China of intellectual property theft and the issue has been a key sore point in U.S.-China relations. But this is the first time the Five Eyes members have joined publicly to call out China on it.
“The Chinese government is engaged in the most sustained scaled and sophisticated theft of intellectual property and expertise in human history,” said Mike Burgess, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation’s director-general.
While China’s intention to innovate for its own national interest was “fine and entirely appropriate”, Burgess said “the behaviour we’re talking about here goes well beyond traditional espionage.”
Last month, his department busted a Chinese plot to infiltrate a prestigious Australian research institution that involved planting an academic there to steal secrets, he said.
“This sort of thing is happening every day in Australia, as it is in the countries here,” Burgess said.
The Five Eyes statement follows the group’s warning in May of a widespread Chinese spy operation it said was targeting critical infrastructure and various other sectors.
The Chinese government dismissed those allegations as a “collective disinformation campaign.”
Wray said China had “a bigger hacking program than that of every other major nation combined” that together with Beijing’s physical spies and stealing of trade secrets from private businesses and research institutions gave the country enormous power.
“Part of what makes it so challenging is all of those tools deployed in tandem, at a scale the likes of which we’ve never seen,” Wray said.

The officials called for private industry and academia to help in countering those threats, chief among which they said were artificial intelligence tools.
“We worry about AI as an amplifier for all sorts of misconduct,” Wray said, accusing China of stealing more personal and corporate data than any other nation by orders of magnitude.
“If you think about what AI can do to help leverage that data to take what’s already the largest hacking program in the world by a country mile, and make it that much more effective - that’s what we’re worried about,” he said.",https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20231018&t=2&i=1648038297&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEJ9H03D,2023-10-18 02:54:03

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in July proposed raising Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) car requirements by 2% and by 4% for trucks and SUVs annually between 2027 and 2032. Tesla wants the agency to finalize rules increasing stringency for cars by 6% annually and 8% for trucks and SUVs, saying it would best “conserve energy and address climate change.”
The NHTSA’s proposal would result in a fleet-wide average fuel efficiency of 58 miles (93 km) per gallon by 2032.
Tesla’s position puts it sharply at odds with major automakers.
On Monday a group representing General Motors, Toyota Motor, Volkswagen and nearly all other major automakers sharply criticized NHTSA’s proposal, saying it is unreasonable and requested significant revisions.
The American Automotive Policy Council, a group representing the Detroit Three automakers, separately urged NHTSA to halve its proposed fuel economy increases to 2% annually for trucks, saying the proposal “would disproportionately impact the truck fleet.”
The group noted 83% of vehicles produced by Ford, GM and Chrysler parent Stellantis are trucks.
NHTSA said in response its rule “is focused on saving Americans money at the gas pump and strengthening American energy independence” and estimated the combined benefits of the proposal exceed costs by more than $18 billion.
The Alliance for Automotive Innovation said last month automakers would face more than $14 billion in non-compliance penalties between 2027 and 2032.
Toyota said on Tuesday the fines are “proof that there is insufficient technology to meet the proposed standards and that such standards have been set beyond maximum feasible.”U.S. automakers separately have warned the fines would cost GM $6.5 billion, Stellantis $3.1 billion and Ford $1 billion, citing NHTSA’s projections.
Automakers also raised alarm at the Energy Department’s proposal to significantly revise how it calculates the petroleum-equivalent fuel economy rating for EVs in NHTSA’s CAFE program, saying it would “devalue the fuel economy of electric vehicles by 72%.”",https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20231017&t=2&i=1648024929&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEJ9G0Q4,2023-10-17 23:44:34

On Tuesday, the U.S. announced new measures that seek to tighten restrictions and close loopholes in a slew of new rules announced last October. Those rules aimed to stem the flow of high-end American artificial intelligence chips and chipmaking tools into China.
As the United States has slashed the amount of top technology headed to China, it has also been using the promise of billions of dollars of funding to entice non-Chinese chipmakers to set up shop, or expand operations, in the United States.
“Chips are at the center of the administration’s economic security and national security agenda when it comes to managing the competition with China,” said Emily Kilcrease, senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and former deputy assistant U.S. Trade Representative.
The United States has been locked in a technology war with China since former President Trump blacklisted Chinese telecoms giant Huawei in 2019. The move heightened tensions between the two countries and forced U.S. suppliers to get a special license before selling to the company.
While President Joe Biden has taken aim at fewer big-name Chinese companies since taking office in 2021, his administration has stepped up its efforts to keep China from advancing in three key fields: semiconductors, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing.
The best examples of these efforts are the export controls unveiled last October, and an executive order released in August, which forces investors to notify the government of most transactions in those sectors while banning a smaller subset.
“The Biden administration is pivoting from a prior strategy of ‘the U.S. should stay a couple generations ahead of China in chip design and manufacturing’ to ‘we should stay as far ahead as we can on chip design and manufacturing,’” said Peter Harrell, a former Biden administration official who said the change was due to a recognition of the wide range of applications for semiconductor chips with national security implications.
China has reacted to the measures by accusing the U.S. of using national security to justify economic bullying of its companies. It has also hit back with raids of U.S. businesses operating there and banned Chinese companies from working with U.S. chipmaker Micron.
BILLIONS FOR CHIPS
The United States, meanwhile, has been helping non-Chinese chipmakers negotiate with states like Arizona, Texas and New York to set up shop or grow existing operations.
According to the Semiconductor Industry Association, the share of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity in the U.S. has decreased from 37% in 1990 to 12% in 2022.
With avid White House support, Congress passed the landmark “Chips and Science” law in 2022, which provides $52.7 billion for U.S. semiconductor production, research and workforce development.
Chipmakers both foreign and domestic have lined up to ask for a share of the $39 billion earmarked for semiconductor production, from Taiwan’s TSMC to South Korea’s Samsung and U.S.-based Intel.
Companies have already announced plans to build or expand U.S.-based fabs, and awards are expected to be announced in short order. Intel, for example, announced a $20 billion investment to build a new mega chip factory in Ohio in January, and hopes to use some of the Chips and Science Act money to pay for it.
Beyond the tech realm, the U.S. and China remain at odds over issues from Taiwan and tension in the South China Sea to trade, fentanyl and human rights.",https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20231017&t=2&i=1647989743&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEJ9G0RV,2023-10-17 16:46:14
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/17/when-was-the-last-time-marc-andreessen-talked-to-a-poor-person/,When was the last time Marc Andreessen talked to a poor person?,"Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen posted a manifesto on the a16z website, calling for “techno-optimism” in a frenzied, 5,000-word blog post that somehow manages to re-invent Reaganomics, propose the colonization of outer space and unironically answer a question with the phrase “QED.”
Andreessen’s vision of techno-optimism could seem inspiring: He imagines a Libertarian-esque world where technology solves all of our problems, poverty and climate change are eradicated, and an honest meritocracy reigns supreme. Though Andreessen may call us “Communists and Luddites” for saying so, his dreams are unrealistic, and founded upon a flawed premise that tech exclusively makes the world better.
First, we need to remember the biases that Andreessen brings to the table, mainly that he is absurdly wealthy (worth an estimated $1.35 billion as of September 2022) and that his absurd wealth is largely tied to the investments of his namesake tech venture fund. So, he inherently is going to push for his techno-optimist vision, because the success of tech companies means he gets even more rich. When you have a financial stake in something, you become biased: This is why, as reporters, we can’t buy Netflix stock, then turn around and write an article about why Netflix is going to have a great Q4.
But money can be blinding. Early on in his essay, Andreessen writes, “We believe that there is no material problem – whether created by nature or by technology – that cannot be solved with more technology.” A16z is increasingly investing in defense companies, including Palmer Luckey’s controversial startup Anduril, which manufactures autonomous weapons. Is war the problem these companies are solving? What does “solve” even mean in the context of conflicts like the ongoing war in Israel and Gaza — isn’t the true solution an end to conflict?
Another inconsistency lies in Andreessen’s assertion that “technological innovation in a market system is inherently philanthropic, by a 50:1 ratio.” He references economist William Nordhaus’ claim that those who create technology only retain 2% of its economic value, so the other 98% “flows through to society.”
“Who gets more value from a new technology, the single company that makes it, or the millions or billions of people who use it to improve their lives?” asks Andreessen.
We won’t lie and say that tech startups have not made our lives easier. If we’re out too late and the subway isn’t running, we can take an Uber or Lyft. If we want to buy a book and get it delivered to our doors by the end of the day, we can order it on Amazon. But to deny the negative impacts of these companies is to move through the world with blinders up.
Furthermore, it’s implicit — but not stated in Andreessen’s argument — that these platforms have effectively made large swatches of society renters, and the platforms, the landlords. Perhaps he needs a refresher on the ills of the “rentier economy” and how antithetical it is to innovators and entrepreneurship?
When was the last time Marc Andreessen walked through the streets of San Francisco, where wealthy tech workers pretend that they don’t see the homeless encampments outside of their companies’ HQ?
When was the last time Marc Andreessen talked to a poor person — or an Instacart shopper struggling to make ends meet, for that matter?
Andreessen’s argument is a contemporary rehashing of trickle-down economics, the notorious Reagan-era idea that as rich people get richer, some of that wealth will “trickle down” to the poor. But this theory has been repeatedly debunked. Again: Do Amazon warehouse workers really get their fair share?
At one point, Andreessen makes the case that free markets “prevent monopolies” because the “market naturally disciplines.” As any third-party Amazon seller will tell you — or anyone who’s tried to get Eras Tour tickets — this is a point easily disproved. Andreessen may argue that the U.S. market isn’t truly “free” in the sense that it’s regulated by agencies and the lawmakers who empower those agencies to enforce policy. But the U.S. has had its fair share of stretches of laissez-faire tech oversight, and each has spawned — not stifled — tech giants strongly inclined to crush competition.
Andreessen’s motivations are further crystalized when he makes a list of whom he considers to be his enemies.
In that section, he lists off what he feels has subjugated society to “mass demoralization.” On this list is a mention of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the 17 objectives that were created to inspire nations to strive toward peace. According to Andreessen, these are the so-called enemies “against technology and life:” environmental sustainability, reduced gender inequalities, the elimination of poverty or hunger, and more good jobs.
How are these 17 goals against technology and life, when technology is already being used to achieve more life — already being used to make clean water, alleviate mass production and generate clean energy? He has a vague, empty way of writing that leaves more questions than answers; it brings forth the idea that he has probably never read the 17 Sustainable Goals, and that instead he is using it as a code word for something else. Then, Andreessen decries ESG stakeholder capitalism, tech ethics, trust and safety, and risk management as enemies to his cause.
What are you really trying to say, Marc? That regulation and accountability are bad? That we should pursue the development of technology at the expense of all else, in hopes that the world will be better if Amazon stock breaks $200 per share?
Andreessen has a coded way of speaking in general, so it’s no wonder that he takes such umbrage with the UN’s goals of supporting those most at risk. He talks about the planet being “dramatically underpopulated” and specifically calls out the way “developed societies” are dwindling in population, a seeming endorsement of one of the core tenets of pronatalism. He wants 50 billion people to be on earth (and then for some of us to colonize outer space), and says the “markets” can generate the money needed to fund social welfare programs. (We must repeat the question: Has this man been to San Francisco lately?) He also mentions that Universal Basic Income “would turn people into zoo animals to be farmed by the state.” (Sam Altman would no doubt disagree.) He wants us to work, to be productive, “to be proud.”
The missing link here is how we can use tech to actually take care of people; how to feed them, clothe them, how to make sure the planet doesn’t reach such high temperatures that we all just melt away. What is missing here is that San Francisco is already the tech hub of the world and is one of the most unequal places in the universe, both socially and economically. What is missing here is that the technological revolution made it easier to hail an Uber or order food delivery, but did nothing about how those drivers and delivery people are being exploited, and how some live in their cars to sustain a decent wage.
There are lines and lines to analyze in his manifesto, but it all goes back to the point that what’s missing here is life: the element of living and all its nuances. He takes an either “you are for technology” or “against it” approach to actually utilizing productivity to help make lives better. He talks about the economic frameworks that life is spun around, without mentioning the intricate ways it actually impacts people.
Plenty of tech giants speak of creating a world they have no grasp on. We watch as Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg “moves fast and breaks things” and then ends up testifying before Congress about election interference. We watch as OpenAI founder Sam Altman draws parallels between himself and Robert Oppenheimer, not stopping to think so much about whether or not it’s a good thing to push the limits of technological innovation at any cost.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/18/objective-emerges-from-stealth-to-deliver-multimodal-search-to-developers-as-an-api-platform/,Objective emerges from stealth to deliver multimodal search to developers as an API platform,"Objective emerges from stealth to deliver multimodal search to developers as an API platform
Objective (previously named Kailua Labs), a multimodal search platform built by machine learning experts from Apple, Google, Meta, Amazon and Twilio, emerged from stealth today with $13 million in venture funding.
Objective is a low-code platform that allows developers to build multi-search apps that handle input and output in multiple formats– text, images, video and audio. Unlike traditional keyword-based search algorithms, Objective’s in-house technology produces contextually relevant results, allowing users to search using natural language or even a combination of data like simultaneously entering image and text queries. As users interact and search different terms, the system further learns how to optimize for the types of user behavior that it sees.
Multimodal search has been a topic of conversation among technology companies for years. In the same way that OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4 has brought generative AI to the mainstream, tech giants Google and Microsoft are influencing more and more companies to invest in multimodal large language models in order to improve the search and discovery experience.
Objective aims to be the go-to affordable solution for all developers to have multimodal search in their toolkits.
“The way the systems are built is super difficult,” Co-founder and CEO Pablo Mendes said during our interview. “Every top 1% most sophisticated company is working on that. We have this hypothesis that most companies in the world would prefer to buy a solution rather than try to build a team in-house… We’re building a platform to make it easy and level the playing field.”
Objective was co-founded by three ex-Apple employees – Mendes, Joachim Daiber and Lance Hasson — who worked in the AI machine learning division and were responsible for general knowledge queries for Siri.
“We saw this huge movement happening around machine learning,” Mendes added. “We knew that this was going to change the way that everybody will approach search.”
Objective has raised $13 million across multiple funding rounds. It’s backed by Matrix Partners, Two Sigma Ventures and angel investors such as Topsy co-founder Vipul Ved Prakash, Lattice co-founder Mike Cafarella and former director at Airbnb Georg Bauser, among others.
“Here’s a team who’ve built search for iOS, YouTube – some of the most loved products in history – and every developer in the world can leverage their experience with just a few lines of code,” said Patrick Malatack, partner at Matrix, in a statement.
Nearly a dozen launch partners are using Objective Search, including food distribution company Pod Foods, digital designer’s platform Dribbble and major news publication The Information.
“You can only do so much with manual tagging and scrubbing of results,” said Zack Onisko, CEO of Dribbble. “Implementing semantic search in-house was taking very long. We saw a demo of Objective Search and it was night and day! This partnership will significantly accelerate our data science roadmap.”
Developers can schedule a demo with Objective today. Pricing depends on the company size, how much data they have and how many queries they get, among other factors.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Objective-inc-founders.jpg?resize=1200,911",2023-10-18 11:00:48
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/18/openai-formally-brings-bing-powered-search-to-chatgpt-as-dall-e-3-arrives-in-beta/,OpenAI formally brings web search to ChatGPT as DALL-E 3 integration arrives in beta,"OpenAI has formally launched its internet-browsing feature to ChatGPT, some three weeks after re-introducing the feature in beta after several months in hiatus.
ChatGPT, the generative AI chatbot that has taken the world by storm these past 12 months, has historically been limited to data up to September, 2021 — rendering it useless as a real-time search engine. However, OpenAI started bringing internet services to ChatGPT back in March, a move that always came with inherent risks, given that the live web isn’t curated in the same way a static training data set is — this potentially opened the doors to abuse by bad actors and good old-fashioned algorithmic chaos.
Then in May, OpenAI started rolling out web search via Bing, the search engine belonging to OpenAI’s corporate backer Microsoft, before extending access to the ChatGPT mobile app in late June. However, the new feature was swiftly pulled after it was discovered that ChatGPT was capable of displaying paywalled content.
Fast-forward to late September, and OpenAI started rolling the Browse with Bing feature out again, having fine-tuned how ChatGPT follows instructions laid out by content owners — essentially, it now promised to adhere to whatever a site-owner said in its Robots.txt file, similar to traditional web crawlers.
Now, Browse with Bing is officially available to all Plus and Enterprise subscribers, with no need to toggle their beta switch in settings.
In related news, OpenAI also transitioned DALL-E 3 into beta, a month after debuting the latest incarnation of the text-to-image generator.
DALL-E 3 sports integration with ChatGPT, meaning that users don’t have to think so carefully about their text-prompts when asking DALL-E to create an image — ChatGPT can do a lot of the heavylifting to ensure that the image the user gets, is closer to what they wanted.
But more than that, with DALL-E 3 embedded directly into ChatGPT, users will now be able to receive images as part of their text-based queries without having to switch between the two apps.
DALL-E 3 is available in beta now on the web and mobile, with users able to activate the feature by selecting “DALL-E 3 (Beta)” from the GPT-4 tab inside ChatGPT.
Vocal range
This all constitutes part of a broader expansion that is leading ChatGPT farther from a pure text-based generator, and down a path where audio and imagery are very much part of its remit.
Last month, OpenAI gave ChatGPT a mouth and ears with users able to have a verbal conversation with the chatbot, bringing together the worlds of Alexa-style voice assistants with powerful large language models (LLMs). For example, a user will be able to ask ChatGPT to invent and then narrate a bedtime story for their kid on the spot, though it’s maybe worth being on hand to see what it comes up with.
Additionally, ChatGPT will also allow users to search for answers using images, meaning that someone can upload a picture of an object and discover what it is or find similar items.
So today’s news very much fits into OpenAI broader push to make ChatGPT a fully integrated, real-time, multimedia generative search engine.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1647521480-e1694685235777.jpg?resize=1200,676",2023-10-18 10:32:40
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/17/zygon-helps-startups-avoid-data-breaches-from-saas-providers/,Zygon helps startups avoid data breaches from SaaS providers,"Last week, cloud computing company Shadow confirmed a data breach involving customers’ personal information. The hacker claims to have access to the data of more than 530,000 customers. According to an email from Shadow CEO Eric Sèle, the hacker managed to download this data from a software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider’s API. This is just a recent example in a long list of data breaches that have affected companies of all sizes.
And if you’re a tech CEO, you probably don’t want to be in that position. In the current regulatory landscape, you often have to notify privacy watchdogs and navigate regulatory obligations. More importantly, you risk losing the trust of your clients when you notify them of the breach.
That’s the reason why Zygon caught my attention. This new French startup reviews all the SaaS applications used by your team — and it doesn’t just focus on official services as it can identify shadow SaaS services that some teams have been quietly using without telling the IT department.
At first, I thought Zygon could be particularly useful as a cost saving service. As many VC firms are still passing on deals that would have made sense a few years ago, some startups are actively reviewing their SaaS contracts to see if they can cancel a few subscriptions and extend their runway.
But the startup wants to go beyond this initial usage and build a security startup for your SaaS services. Zygon recently raised a $3 million seed round with Axeleo Capital leading the round, Kima Ventures and several business angels also participating.
Visibility on shadow IT
After the initial inventory process, Zygon customers get a dashboard with all the SaaS applications with the number of users per application.
“We are using the metadata of employee emails, we go through the entire email history and detect those that are related to a SaaS usage,” Zygon co-founder and Chief Product Officer Kevin Smouts told me.
For SaaS applications that are connected to the official identity management solution, such as Okta, Zygon isn’t going to be particularly useful. But some SaaS startups have been particularly successful in recent years because it takes just a few minutes to create an account and get started.
They are taking advantage of that by promoting bottom-up adoption with freemium plans, self-service usage and virality features. Dropbox, Zoom or Notion are popular examples of this trend.
And SaaS sprawl creates three different issues for businesses — security, legal and costs.
Instead of building integration with every single SaaS product on earth, Zygon is using the same approach and decentralizing security across the organization. Zygon encourages you to designate SaaS admins. From now on, they are in charge of the usage of a specific tool in the organization.
They get recommendations when it comes to security configuration tasks, multi-factor authentication and more. For popular application, IT departments can take over as admins, prioritize the rollout of SSO authentication to control account orchestration and more.
More generally speaking, Zygon brings some sort of control over SaaS usage. If someone has multiple accounts for the same service, Zygon can flag that. If several employees are sharing an account, Zygon can also identify that. And if a company wants to comply with SOC 2 and ISO frameworks, Zygon can mitigate risks by minimizing the attack surface.
Zygon can be particularly useful when someone quits or when there is a wave of layoffs. It can list services that are still active even after an employee has left the company.
“In the current situation, IT is only in control of a very small number of SaaS applications. And most accounts remain active for a very long time after employees’ departures — in the current context of layoffs, these are gaping security holes. We go further by detecting which SaaS applications have APIs or access keys that also need to be ‘rotated’ in the event of an employee departure,” Smouts said.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-597318809.jpg?resize=1200,1081",2023-10-18 06:30:00
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/17/flanks-automate-wealth-management-europe-fintech/,Flanks grabs additional capital to automate wealth services in Europe,"Flanks, which has built an API for automated wealth services, secured $8 million in Series A capital to democratize access to wealth management across Europe.
Earlybird Venture Capital led the round and was joined by existing investors JME Ventures and 4Founders Capital. Scalapay co-founder Raffaele Terrone and Upvest co-founder and CEO Martin Kassing supported the round as angel investors.
The Barcelona-based company was founded in 2019 by software engineers Joaquim de la Cruz and Sergi Lao and private banking executive Álvaro Morales. Their vision was to digitize global wealth data across custodians and gather it under one API so that clients can have a complete view of their investment portfolio in real time and make more intelligent investment decisions.
Flanks, whose clients span from large financial institutions to family offices to independent financial advisors, is leveraging the regulatory shift going on in Europe around open banking. More recent proposed legislation, including the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID III), is focusing on open finance to establish rights and obligations to manage financial data access beyond payment accounts.
As de la Cruz explains it, with open banking there was not previously a way to share financial data with a third party or for financial advisors to know the global asset allocation of their customers. That’s why the company created its “open wealth” software.
“Open wealth means a movement in the industry to empower clients to share their data with third parties,” de la Cruz told TechCrunch. “Financial advisors can connect the information of their clients with two clicks on the platform, and then they can get all the wealth information — a 360-degree view — of the client in a single source of truth.”
Flanks operates in Spain, France and eight other countries. It connects with more than 300 banks internationally and aggregates more than half a million investment portfolios monthly. Over the past year it doubled the number of clients to 100 and focused on bigger clients with the potential to get Flanks in front of millions of end users.
Meanwhile, the company grew its revenue by more than 4x in the past 12 months.
The Series A funding will help the team continue to expand locations internationally and boost their product pipeline. Last year, Flanks created products on top of the data. For example, a no-code process so that financial advisors could use and analyze data. Another was if a client moved to a new bank, the financial advisor could change that on their end in two clicks.
“This is the best opportunity for data in years because now you can mix your data with AI and create a lot of vertical products,” de la Cruz said. “We want to continue building end-to-end use cases now and are developing a use case with OpenAI to connect the data so the financial advisor really can work with the data to help clients grow their portfolio.”","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Flanks_Team.jpg?resize=1200,675",2023-10-18 06:00:58
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/17/foxconn-and-nvidia-are-building-ai-factories-to-accelerate-self-driving-cars/,Foxconn and Nvidia are building 'AI factories' to accelerate self-driving cars,"Nvidia and Foxconn are working together to build so-called “AI factories,” a new class of data centers that promise to provide supercomputing powers to accelerate the development of self-driving cars, autonomous machines and industrial robots.
Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang and Foxconn chairman and CEO Young Liu announced the collaboration at Hon Hai Tech Day in Taiwan on Tuesday. The AI factory is based off an Nvidia GPU computing infrastructure that will be built to process, refine and transform vast amounts of data into valuable AI models and information.
“We’re building this entire end-to-end system where on the one hand, you’re building this advanced EV car…with an AI brain inside that allows it to interact with drivers and interact with passengers, as well as autonomously drive, complemented by an AI factory that develops a software for this car,” said Huang onstage at the event. “This car will go through life experience and collect more data. The data will go to the AI factory, where the AI factory will improve the software and update the entire AI fleet.”
The AI factory tie-up builds off a partnership between Nvidia and Foxconn announced in January to develop autonomous vehicle platforms. That agreement involved Foxconn becoming a primary supplier of electronic control units (ECUs) for automakers, which will be built with Nvidia’s Drive Orin system-on-a-chip (SoC), a supercomputing AI platform that supports autonomous driving functions. On Tuesday, Foxconn also committed to manufacturing ECUs with Drive Thor, Nvidia’s next-gen SoC, after production starts in 2025.
As part of that partnership, Foxconn — which has been steadily unveiling off-the-shelf EV platforms for automakers to purchase — said the vehicles it makes as a contract manufacturer will be built with Nvidia’s Drive Hyperion 9 platform, which includes not only Drive Thor, but also a suite of sensors like cameras, radar, lidar and ultrasonic that are necessary for self-driving capabilities.
Foxconn is already contracted to build EVs for Fisker, even as it gets sued by its erstwhile partner Lordstown Motors. The automaker will need scale in order to make its AI factories viable, especially if it’s going to compete with Tesla.
Because these AI factories are essentially rivals to Tesla’s Dojo supercomputer, which the Elon Musk-owned automaker started production on over the summer. Dojo will train Tesla’s neural nets, which are used to power, train and improve “full self-driving” (FSD), the automaker’s advanced driver assistance system. Musk hopes FSD will actually be fully self driving one day, which is where the powerful compute of Dojo comes in.
Tesla today uses a large Nvidia GPU-based supercomputer, but the new Dojo will be custom-built using chips designed by Tesla. The Foxconn-Nvidia AI factories will be based on Nvidia’s GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip and AI Enterprise software, according to the company.
The factories will have other applications beyond self-driving cars.
On stage at Hon Hai’s tech event, Liu shared Foxconn’s goal to convert itself “from a manufacturing service company to a platform solutions company” by scaling the AI factories across various industries. Foxconn is targeting three platforms to start: Smart EVs, smart cities and smart manufacturing.
“This is a factory that takes data input and produces intelligence as an output,” said Huang, as Liu nodded his assent. “In the future, every industry, every company will have an AI factory.”","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-18-at-3.18.03-pm.png?resize=1200,604",2023-10-18 05:32:30
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/17/x-starts-experimenting-with-a-1-per-year-fee-for-new-users/,X starts experimenting with a $1 per year fee for new users,"X, formerly Twitter, announced today that is starting a new experiment to charge a $1 per year fee for “new unverified” users to interact with posts. The company said this test is currently live in New Zealand and the Philippines and existing users won’t be affected.
Users will get to post content, like, repost, reply, bookmark, and quote posts for paying that fee. New free users will just get a read-only account to look at posts and follow accounts.
The company’s support account clarified that this “Not A bot” program is not a profit driver — but it’s hard to take reason at face value. The Elon Musk-owned company said that this program will help it reduce spam.
“This new test was developed to bolster our already successful efforts to reduce spam, manipulation of our platform, and bot activity while balancing platform accessibility with the small fee amount. It is not a profit driver,” the company said.
Starting today, we're testing a new program (Not A Bot) in New Zealand and the Philippines. New, unverified accounts will be required to sign up for a $1 annual subscription to be able to post & interact with other posts. Within this test, existing users are not affected. This… — Support (@Support) October 17, 2023
On its support page, the company said it will share the results of the program’s effectiveness to battle spam.
The move comes after Musk said that X is planning to charge users “a small monthly payment” to use its service. While the payment in the test program is annual, ethos is the same.
In June, X (which was Twitter at that time) started requiring users to log into the site to view posts. Days later the platform withdrew this requirement and allowed logged-out users to look at posts.
A recent report from market intelligence firm Simialrweb suggests that traffic on X has dipped one year after Musk’s $44 billion acquisition. The company has been taking drastic measures to cut costs and start earning a profit.
Last month, the company’s CEO, Linda Yaccarino, said in an interview that X will be profitable in 2024. During the interview, the former NBCU exec sidestepped the question about X’s plans to charge a fee to users.
X currently has only one $8 per month paid plan. However, according to recently discovered code, the company might introduce three premium tiers with one being fully ad-free.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/17/tesla-looks-to-maintain-ev-dominance-by-pushing-for-stricter-fuel-standards/,Tesla looks to maintain EV dominance by pushing for stricter fuel standards,"Tesla has already cornered the electric vehicle market in the U.S. Now, it’s calling for stricter regulations that will give it even more of an edge.
The Elon Musk-owned automaker is urging the Biden administration to adopt tougher fuel economy standards than regulators have proposed, a move that is likely to irritate legacy automakers like General Motors, Ford and Stellantis. Collectively, those three companies face a combined $10.5 billion in non-compliance fines from 2027 to 2032 under the proposed standards, and have already urged regulators to ease up.
Tesla’s call on regulators to double down is another way for the company to one-up its competitors. GM, Ford and Stellantis are embroiled in a bitter union strike that has already cost them $3.45 billion and will affect their rollout of electric vehicles. And as strike costs mount, these automakers appear to be dealing with softening demand for their EVs, which are priced at a premium. Tesla’s workforce is non-unionized and it only produces electric vehicles, so the company stands to gain from both the strikes and stricter fuel standards.
And Tesla might just need the boost if it wants to continue to dominate EV market share in the U.S. The company has been slashing its car prices to boost sales. And while Tesla delivered a record number of vehicles in the third quarter this year, its market share is down 10 points from a year ago.
In a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Tesla said the agency should finalize rules to increase the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards by 6% annually for passenger cars and 8% annually for trucks and SUVs. That’s up from NHTSA’s proposal of 2% for cars and 4% for trucks and SUVs, which would reach an average fleet fuel economy of 58 miles per gallon by 2032.
Tesla argues its own proposals would “significantly reduce energy consumption, mitigate climate change, and appropriately recognize the increasing marketplace adoption of BEV technology in both the light-duty and [heavy-duty pickup truck] sectors.” That last part is important. One of the main themes throughout Tesla’s letter to NHTSA is that the agency doesn’t correctly consider the current and projected market penetration of EVs.
Tesla writes that numerous manufacturers — like Toyota, Hyundai, JLR and Subaru — have announced EV production goals that fall within the timeframe of the proposed standard, and highlighted the over $115 billion that automakers and battery makers have committed to expand EV and battery production in North America.
“EVs represent 9.1 percent of new light-duty vehicle sales in the second quarter of 2023,” reads the letter. “Continuing this rapid growth has led to estimates that by 2024 every third commercially newly registered car could be an electric vehicle.”
Tesla also calls NHTSA out for leaving out future vehicle models, like the Cybertruck pickup, from its modeling. The rollout of the futuristic-looking pickup truck has been long delayed, but Tesla said it expects to begin deliveries of the Cybertruck later this year. The EV-maker appears to have shared with NHTSA how many vehicles it will deliver this year and its plans for production ramp up in order. That information was redacted from the published version of the letter, but it’s clear Tesla thinks it can produce enough so that the heavy-duty pickup truck standards it suggested will by “technologically feasible” by 2024.
NHTSA’s proposal also includes a note to reduce “off-cycle credits,” which allow automakers to earn credits for adopting technologies that improve the real-world fuel efficiency of their vehicles beyond what the CAFE standard tests measure. Things like improved air conditioning systems and advanced engine stop-start systems that shut off the engine when the vehicle is stopped. Tesla says NHTSA should take those things off the table entirely.
“Even if reduced, the continuing of off-cycle crediting creates asymmetry in the regulation favoring ICE vehicles, diverts research and development investment away from the best emissions reduction technology of electrification, and unnecessarily weakens the stringency of the standard,” writes Tesla.
Throughout the letter, Tesla peppered its humble brags about its own technological capabilities with reminders that its suggested fuel standards would result in better climate outcomes. And indeed, harsher fuel standards would result in fewer emissions, but only if automakers are able to adhere to those standards. If not, they’ll just be paying fines for non-compliance.
The Alliance for Automotive Innovation last month said automakers would face more than $14 billion in non-compliance penalties between 2027 and 2032 under the proposed standards. Toyota on Tuesday said those fines are proof that the standards are not technologically feasible.
Most other automakers have called NHTSA’s proposals unreasonable and have requested revisions. They almost certainly couldn’t stomach the more radical standards Tesla is proposing.
The American Automotive Policy Council, a group that represents the Detroit Three automakers (GM, Ford and Stellantis), urged NHTSA to halve its proposed fuel economy increases to 2% for trucks, claiming the proposal would “disproportionately impact the truck fleet.” The organization said 83% of the vehicles produced by Ford, GM and Stellantis are trucks.
Once again, Tesla would be safe here. The Elon Musk-owned automaker began initial delivery of its electric Semi truck in December 2022, and in January announced a $3.6 billion expansion to its Nevada gigafactory in large part to scale manufacturing of the Class 8 truck.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-1397664328.jpg?resize=1200,800",2023-10-18 01:46:37
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/17/amazons-fleet-of-rivian-made-electric-delivery-vans-reaches-10000-in-us/,Amazon's fleet of Rivian-made electric delivery vans reaches 10K in US,"Amazon’s 10,000 Rivian-made all-electric van are delivering packages throughout the United States, the e-commerce company revealed Tuesday evening during its Delivering the Future event.
Amazon, which owns a stake in Rivian, reached a deal with the automaker in 2019 to have at least 100,000 electric delivery vans on the road by 2030. The order is part of Amazon’s climate pledge to become carbon neutral by 2040.
Amazon began rolling out its electric delivery vans in summer 2022. The majority of the electric delivery vans are in the U.S., split across 1,800 or so cities. Amazon started bringing the electric delivery vans to Europe this summer and recently announced plans to deploy more than 300 vans in Germany.
The custom electric delivery van is one of three vehicles that Rivian is developing or producing. Its other two vehicles, the R1T pickup and R1S SUV, are consumer EVs. Rivian said earlier this month it expects to produce 52,000 vehicles — a group that includes the vans — by the end of the year.
The vehicles, which are assembled at Rivian’s factory in Normal, Illinois, share some of the same design features found in today’s gas-powered versions. The new EV vans have a few more rounded edges, giving them an overall sleeker appearance. The real difference is in the electric architecture and the custom features that have been integrated into the vans, including highway driving and traffic assist features, exterior cameras that can provide a 360-degree view for the driver via a digital display, and surround taillights for better braking visibility.
As part of Amazon’s climate pledge, the company has also launched a $2 billion climate fund to invest in startups that fit into its net-zero vision. Rivian as well as Redwood Materials, CarbonCure Technologies, Pachama and Turntide Technologies are few of the companies that Amazon has invested in through the climate fund.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/amazon-rivian-event.jpg?resize=1200,869",2023-10-18 01:37:17
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/17/israel-looks-to-roll-out-spacex-starlink-internet-amid-war-with-hamas/,Israel looks to roll out SpaceX Starlink internet amid war with Hamas,"Israel is in discussions with SpaceX to roll out Starlink internet services, especially for communities near the conflict zone, an Israeli official said Tuesday.
Starlink currently isn’t available in Israel, so this would be the first time the service is introduced in any capacity. As it seeks to bolster its own communications during wartime, it is also looking into halting cell and internet communications in Gaza, that same official said.
“The activity of coordinating the Israeli company Starlink is taking place, enabling the operation of communication terminals by the company SpaceX, which will allow a wide broadband internet connection in Israel,” Israel Minister of Communications Shlomo Karhi said on X. “Additionally, under the guidance of the minister, the ministry promotes the purchase of these satellite devices for the benefit of regional councils and community leaders in conflict zone settlements.”
Karhi’s statement comes a little over one week after Hamas, the Palestinian group that controls the Gaza Strip, led a brutal assault on Israel that killed more than 1,400 people, mostly civilian Israelis. That attack has been followed by days of retaliatory airstrikes in Gaza, which have in turn killed over 2,800 Palestinians — also mostly civilians.
There is no sign that the war will end soon. The revelation that satellite-based internet provides a critical edge during conflict was made salient shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, when Ukrainian forces relied on Starlink to maintain communications.
But the role that Starlink plays in conflict is far from settled. Earlier this year, it was revealed that SpaceX CEO Elon Musk refused to activate the service when Ukraine requested it prior to a planned attack on Russia’s navy. He later said that he never authorized it to be used, and, “If I had agreed to their request, then SpaceX would be explicitly complicit in a major act of war and conflict escalation.”
It is unclear when that service might come online or how many users it may have initially. TechCrunch has reached out to the Israeli government and will update the story if a representative responds. It’s also unclear if these terminals would be purchased directly from SpaceX, via its Starshield defense-focused business unit.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1730410000.jpg?resize=1200,800",2023-10-17 22:16:22
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/17/stellantis-cancels-ces-uaw-strike/,The UAW strike is starting to affect CES 2024,"Stellantis announced Tuesday that it will cancel its planned presentations and display at CES 2024, the tech trade show that takes over Las Vegas every January.
The reason? The automaker, which owns a slew of U.S. brands, including Jeep, Ram and Chrysler, cited the cost of the ongoing United Auto Workers strike, which has entered its fifth week.
“In light of the current status of negotiations in the United States, preserving business fundamentals and therefore protecting the future of the company is a top priority of Stellantis leadership,” the company said in an statement.
Over the past several years, CES has become an auto show of sorts with automakers such as General Motors, Ford, Toyota, Hyundai and Stellantis plunking serious coin to set up elaborate displays and debut new vehicles and technology.
In-car tech and EVs dominated CES 2023, and Stellantis was one of the more visible automakers there. The company revealed Peugeot and the Ram 1500 Revolution truck concepts; announced that its Free2move mobility service brand would expand car sharing, rental and subscription services in the U.S.; and revealed a new business unit to turn vehicle data into marketable products — and revenue.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_6471.jpg?resize=1200,900",2023-10-17 22:01:49
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/17/irs-will-pilot-free-direct-tax-filing-in-2024/,"IRS will pilot free, direct tax filing in 2024","The IRS will test a free tax filing service in 2024 for a subset of lucky taxpayers in as many as 13 states, the agency announced today. Direct File, as the service is called, is a shot across the bows of TurboTax, H&R Block and other paid tax prep services, whose owners have resisted free and simple tax filing for decades.
“This is a critical step forward for this innovative effort that will test the feasibility of providing taxpayers a new option to file their returns for free directly with the IRS,” said IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel in a press release announcing the news.
The program is more or less a direct result of funding provided by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, through which $15 million was earmarked for the purpose of exploring and implementing a simple, free, government-provided tax filing service.
Over the last year and a half, the IRS has been building out the pilot program, which it characterizes as being “one more potential option” on the continuum from self-managed Free File, from commercial products like TurboTax to a tax prep professional.
The IRS describes Direct File as “a mobile-friendly, interview-based service” available in English and Spanish, intended for people with simpler tax situations like W-2s and common income credits and deductions. Whether the interviews are with actual people or some kind of automated or semi-automated process is unclear. But this, like many of its specifics, will likely change as the agency receives feedback from this limited scale pilot.
Arizona, California, Massachusetts and New York are the four states that are integrating with Direct File for 2024 (i.e. the 2023 tax year); Alaska, Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming “may also be eligible,” due to not having state income tax, but it is not final. Every state was given the opportunity to participate in the Direct File program, but not all were “in a position to join.”
Among the residents of these states, a limited number of individuals with “relatively simple returns” will have the opportunity to try Direct File. This will in turn “allow the IRS to evaluate the costs, benefits and operational challenges associated with providing a voluntary Direct File option to taxpayers.” In software terms, we’d probably call this an alpha.
Intuit and others which have surreptitiously fought against simple, free and transparent tax filing for many years (as ProPublica documented not long ago) are no doubt seething and scheduling emergency meetings. Like broadband and mobile companies, public opinion has increasingly turned against them as the predatory nature of their services and lobbying has become obvious. When a free anime dating sim can do your taxes as well as a billion-dollar company, the worm has turned.
Update: An Intuit spokesperson contacted TechCrunch to call Direct File “wholly redundant,” and potentially a “financial nightmare” that will cost billions. But we won’t know until we try.
Expect to hear more about this program as tax season approaches.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/GettyImages-98452329.jpg?resize=1200,806",2023-10-17 21:10:48

However, the new offering also adds “enterprise-grade” privacy and data analysis capabilities on top of the vanilla ChatGPT, as well as enhanced performance and customization options.
Survey finds relatively few American actually use ChatGPT
Recent Pew polling suggests the language model isn’t quite as popular or threatening as some would have you think. Ongoing polling by Pew Research shows that although ChatGPT is gaining mindshare, only about 18% of Americans have ever actually used it.

OpenAI brings fine-tuning to GPT-3.5 Turbo
With fine-tuning, companies using GPT-3.5 Turbo through the company’s API can make the model better follow specific instructions. For example, having the model always respond in a given language. Or improving the model’s ability to consistently format responses, as well as hone the “feel” of the model’s output, like its tone, so that it better fits a brand or voice. Most notably, fine-tuning enables OpenAI customers to shorten text prompts to speed up API calls and cut costs.
OpenAI is partnering with Scale AI to allow companies to fine-tune GPT-3.5. However, it is unclear whether OpenAI is developing an in-house tuning tool that is meant to complement platforms like Scale AI or serve a different purpose altogether.
Fine-tuning costs:
Training: $0.008 / 1K tokens
Usage input: $0.012 / 1K tokens
Usage output: $0.016 / 1K tokens

China requires AI apps to obtain an administrative license
Multiple generative AI apps have been removed from Apple’s China App Store ahead of the country’s latest generative AI regulations that are set to take effect August 15.
“As you may know, the government has been tightening regulations associated with deep synthesis technologies (DST) and generative AI services, including ChatGPT. DST must fulfill permitting requirements to operate in China, including securing a license from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT),” Apple said in a letter to OpenCat, a native ChatGPT client. “Based on our review, your app is associated with ChatGPT, which does not have requisite permits to operate in China.”

ChatGPT is coming to Android
ChatGPT is available to “pre-order” for Android users.
The ChatGPT app on Android looks to be more or less identical to the iOS one in functionality, meaning it gets most if not all of the web-based version’s features. You should be able to sync your conversations and preferences across devices, too — so if you’re iPhone at home and Android at work, no worries.
July 20, 2023
OpenAI launches customized instructions for ChatGPT
OpenAI launched custom instructions for ChatGPT users, so they don’t have to write the same instruction prompts to the chatbot every time they interact with it.
The company said this feature lets you “share anything you’d like ChatGPT to consider in its response.” For example, a teacher can say they are teaching fourth-grade math or a developer can specify the code language they prefer when asking for suggestions. A person can also specify their family size, so the text-generating AI can give responses about meals, grocery and vacation planning accordingly.

The FTC is reportedly investigating OpenAI
The FTC is reportedly in at least the exploratory phase of investigation over whether OpenAI’s flagship ChatGPT conversational AI made “false, misleading, disparaging or harmful” statements about people.
TechCrunch Reporter Devin Coldewey reports:
This kind of investigation doesn’t just appear out of thin air — the FTC doesn’t look around and say “That looks suspicious.” Generally a lawsuit or formal complaint is brought to their attention and the practices described by it imply that regulations are being ignored. For example, a person may sue a supplement company because the pills made them sick, and the FTC will launch an investigation on the back of that because there’s evidence the company lied about the side effects.
July 6, 2023
OpenAI announced the general availability of GPT-4
Starting July 6, all existing OpenAI developers “with a history of successful payments” can access GPT-4. OpenAI plans to open up access to new developers by the end of July.
In the future, OpenAI says that it’ll allow developers to fine-tune GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo, one of the original models powering ChatGPT, with their own data, as has long been possible with several of OpenAI’s other text-generating models. That capability should arrive later this year, according to OpenAI.

OpenAI launches a ChatGPT app for iOS
ChatGPT is officially going mobile. The new ChatGPT app will be free to use, free from ads and will allow for voice input, the company says, but will initially be limited to U.S. users at launch.
When using the mobile version of ChatGPT, the app will sync your history across devices — meaning it will know what you’ve previously searched for via its web interface, and make that accessible to you. The app is also integrated with Whisper, OpenAI’s open source speech recognition system, to allow for voice input.

Hackers are using ChatGPT lures to spread malware on Facebook
Meta said in a report on May 3 that malware posing as ChatGPT was on the rise across its platforms. The company said that since March 2023, its security teams have uncovered 10 malware families using ChatGPT (and similar themes) to deliver malicious software to users’ devices.
“In one case, we’ve seen threat actors create malicious browser extensions available in official web stores that claim to offer ChatGPT-based tools,” said Meta security engineers Duc H. Nguyen and Ryan Victory in a blog post. “They would then promote these malicious extensions on social media and through sponsored search results to trick people into downloading malware.”

ChatGPT parent company OpenAI closes $300M share sale at $27B-29B valuation
VC firms including Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive and K2 Global are picking up new shares, according to documents seen by TechCrunch. A source tells us Founders Fund is also investing. Altogether the VCs have put in just over $300 million at a valuation of $27 billion to $29 billion. This is separate to a big investment from Microsoft announced earlier this year, a person familiar with the development told TechCrunch, which closed in January. The size of Microsoft’s investment is believed to be around $10 billion, a figure we confirmed with our source.

OpenAI wants to trademark “GPT”
OpenAI applied for a trademark for “GPT,” which stands for “Generative Pre-trained Transformer,” last December. Last month, the company petitioned the USPTO to speed up the process, citing the “myriad infringements and counterfeit apps” beginning to spring into existence.
Unfortunately for OpenAI, its petition was dismissed last week. According to the agency, OpenAI’s attorneys neglected to pay an associated fee as well as provide “appropriate documentary evidence supporting the justification of special action.”
That means a decision could take up to five more months.

Auto-GPT is Silicon Valley’s latest quest to automate everything
Auto-GPT is an open-source app created by game developer Toran Bruce Richards that uses OpenAI’s latest text-generating models, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to interact with software and services online, allowing it to “autonomously” perform tasks.
Depending on what objective the tool’s provided, Auto-GPT can behave in very… unexpected ways. One Reddit user claims that, given a budget of $100 to spend within a server instance, Auto-GPT made a wiki page on cats, exploited a flaw in the instance to gain admin-level access and took over the Python environment in which it was running — and then “killed” itself.

FTC warns that AI technology like ChatGPT could ‘turbocharge’ fraud
FTC chair Lina Khan and fellow commissioners warned House representatives of the potential for modern AI technologies, like ChatGPT, to be used to “turbocharge” fraud in a congressional hearing.
“AI presents a whole set of opportunities, but also presents a whole set of risks,” Khan told the House representatives. “And I think we’ve already seen ways in which it could be used to turbocharge fraud and scams. We’ve been putting market participants on notice that instances in which AI tools are effectively being designed to deceive people can place them on the hook for FTC action,” she stated.

Italy gives OpenAI to-do list for lifting ChatGPT suspension order
Italy’s data protection watchdog has laid out what OpenAI needs to do for it to lift an order against ChatGPT issued at the end of last month — when it said it suspected the AI chatbot service was in breach of the EU’s GSPR and ordered the U.S.-based company to stop processing locals’ data.
The DPA has given OpenAI a deadline — of April 30 — to get the regulator’s compliance demands done. (The local radio, TV and internet awareness campaign has a slightly more generous timeline of May 15 to be actioned.)

Researchers discover a way to make ChatGPT consistently toxic
A study co-authored by scientists at the Allen Institute for AI shows that assigning ChatGPT a “persona” — for example, “a bad person,” “a horrible person” or “a nasty person” — through the ChatGPT API increases its toxicity sixfold. Even more concerning, the co-authors found having the conversational AI chatbot pose as certain historical figures, gendered people and members of political parties also increased its toxicity — with journalists, men and Republicans in particular causing the machine learning model to say more offensive things than it normally would.
The research was conducted using the latest version, but not the model currently in preview based on OpenAI’s GPT-4.

Y Combinator-backed startups are trying to build ‘ChatGPT for X’
YC Demo Day’s Winter 2023 batch features no fewer than four startups that claim to be building “ChatGPT for X.” They’re all chasing after a customer service software market that’ll be worth $58.1 billion by 2023, assuming the rather optimistic prediction from Acumen Research comes true.
Here are the YC-backed startups that caught our eye:
Yuma, whose customer demographic is primarily Shopify merchants, provides ChatGPT-like AI systems that integrate with help desk software, suggesting drafts of replies to customer tickets.
Baselit, which uses one of OpenAI’s text-understanding models to allow businesses to embed chatbot-style analytics for their customers.
Lasso customers send descriptions or videos of the processes they’d like to automate and the company combines ChatGPT-like interface with robotic process automation (RPA) and a Chrome extension to build out those automations.
BerriAI, whose platform is designed to help developers spin up ChatGPT apps for their organization data through various data connectors.

Italy orders ChatGPT to be blocked
OpenAI has started geoblocking access to its generative AI chatbot, ChatGPT, in Italy.
Italy’s data protection authority has just put out a timely reminder that some countries do have laws that already apply to cutting edge AI: it has ordered OpenAI to stop processing people’s data locally with immediate effect. The Italian DPA said it’s concerned that the ChatGPT maker is breaching the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and is opening an investigation.

1,100+ signatories signed an open letter asking all ‘AI labs to immediately pause for 6 months’
The letter’s signatories include Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak and Tristan Harris of the Center for Humane Technology, among others. The letter calls on “all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4.”
The letter reads:
Contemporary AI systems are now becoming human-competitive at general tasks,[3] and we must ask ourselves: Should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth? Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us? Should we risk loss of control of our civilization? Such decisions must not be delegated to unelected tech leaders. Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable.

ChatGPT first launched to the public as OpenAI quietly released GPT-3.5
GPT-3.5 broke cover with ChatGPT, a fine-tuned version of GPT-3.5 that’s essentially a general-purpose chatbot. ChatGPT can engage with a range of topics, including programming, TV scripts and scientific concepts.
Writers everywhere rolled their eyes at the new technology, much like artists did with OpenAI’s DALL-E model, but the latest chat-style iteration seemingly broadened its appeal and audience.
FAQs:
What is ChatGPT? How does it work?
ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.
When did ChatGPT get released?
November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.
What is the latest version of ChatGPT?
Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4.
Can I use ChatGPT for free?
There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.
Who uses ChatGPT?
Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.
What companies use ChatGPT?
Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.
Most recently, Microsoft announced at it’s 2023 Build conference that it is integrating it ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT. And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.
What does GPT mean in ChatGPT?
GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.
What’s the difference between ChatGPT and Bard?
Much like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Bard is a chatbot that will answer questions in natural language. Google announced at its 2023 I/O event that it will soon be adding multimodal content to Bard, meaning that it can deliver answers in more than just text, responses can give you rich visuals as well. Rich visuals mean pictures for now, but later can include maps, charts and other items.
ChatGPT’s generative AI has had a longer lifespan and thus has been “learning” for a longer period of time than Bard.
What is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?
A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions.
ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.
Can ChatGPT write essays?
Yes.
Can ChatGPT commit libel?
Due to the nature of how these models work, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel.
We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.
Does ChatGPT have an app?
Yes, there is now a free ChatGPT app that is currently limited to U.S. iOS users at launch. OpenAi says an android version is “coming soon.”
What is the ChatGPT character limit?
It’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.
Does ChatGPT have an API?
Yes, it was released March 1, 2023.
What are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?
Everyday examples include programing, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.
What are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?
Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.
How good is ChatGPT at writing code?
It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used.
Can you save a ChatGPT chat?
Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.
Are there alternatives to ChatGPT?
Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google’s Bard and Anthropic’s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives. But the latter are harder — if not impossible — to run today.
The Google-owned research lab DeepMind claimed that its next LLM, will rival, or even best, OpenAI’s ChatGPT. DeepMind is using techniques from AlphaGo, DeepMind’s AI system that was the first to defeat a professional human player at the board game Go, to make a ChatGPT-rivaling chatbot called Gemini.
Apple is developing AI tools to challenge OpenAI, Google and others. The tech giant created a chatbot that some engineers are internally referring to as “Apple GPT,” but Apple has yet to determine a strategy for releasing the AI to consumers.
How does ChatGPT handle data privacy?
OpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.
The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”.
In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”
What controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?
Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.
An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.
CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.
Several major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.
There have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.
Where can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?
Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.
Can ChatGPT be detected?
Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they’re inconsistent at best.
Are ChatGPT chats public?
No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service.
Who owns the copyright on ChatGPT-created content or media?
The user who requested the input from ChatGPT is the copyright owner.
What lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?
None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.
Are there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?
Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1462188043.jpg?resize=1200,798",2023-10-17 21:03:39
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/17/wework-fires-back-at-competitor-codi-with-cease-and-desist/,WeWork fires back at competitor Codi with cease and desist following 'WeWont' campaign,"WeWork has sent a cease and desist letter to rival Codi in response to the startup’s recent marketing campaign it dubs “WeWont,” TechCrunch has exclusively learned.
In the letter dated October 13, viewed by TechCrunch, WeWork’s Chief Legal Officer Pam Swidler cited “unauthorized use and misappropriation of WeWork’s intellectual property, false advertising and Tortious interference with WeWork’s contractual relations with its member companies.”
Codi, which raised $16 million in a round led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) in September 2022, set up booths outside WeWork offices in New York and San Francisco informing companies that their space might be shutting down and offering them to sign on with its rival instead. Codi also set up a “WeWork Relief Fund” offering discounted office space with Codi to those that might be affected by any potential WeWork closures.
For its part, Codi remains undeterred.
“There’s nothing wrong about what we’re doing. I believe it [the campaign] is fair competition,” Codi CEO and co-founder Christelle Rohaut told TechCrunch in an interview today. “We’re doing standard advertising. If anything, we want to provide support to founders and companies who have been impacted.”
Once valued as high as $47 billion, WeWork has faced challenges with a model that involved committing to buying or signing long-term leases in buildings and then not having enough demand from people or businesses to lease or sublease its space.
WeWork not only struggled to bounce back after the COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc on its co-working business, it appears to barely be staying afloat. In August, the flexible space provider said that “substantial doubt exists about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.”
As of Tuesday afternoon, WeWork’s stock was trading at a mere $2.22, down significantly from a 52-week high of $130.80 and from a $520 high in 2021. Also in August, the 13-year-old company announced a net loss of $397 million for the second quarter on revenue of $877 million.
On Monday, WeWork announced it had appointed David Tolley to serve as its new CEO. Tolley, a former Blackstone executive, served as interim CEO of the embattled company since May. He took over that role when former CEO Sandeep Mathrani resigned.
Meanwhile, competitors have arisen attempting to take some of the company’s (albeit dwindling) market share, including Codi and Industrious.
Unlike WeWork, which sold desk space in a shared floor to workers, San Francisco-based Codi does not consider itself a co-working company, according to Rohaut, but rather an office-as-a-service startup. It helps companies find and manage fully private and “turnkey” office space through a managed marketplace.
“A lot of our customers come from co-working and WeWork because they graduate from it at some point,” she added. “They want to get their own culture, they want to have their own space, and we facilitate that.”
The startup began its “WeWon’t” campaign on August 20 after receiving inbound from companies and founders who were affected by WeWork shutting down buildings, Rohaut said.
In its cease and desist letter addressed to Rohaut, WeWork wrote: “We have learned that Codi, itself a provider of coworking space founded years after WeWork, has been making unauthorized uses of the WEWORK Brand and false and misleading statements about WeWork and its offerings to unlawfully solicit WeWork members.” The letter accuses Codi of infringing WeWork’s brand and engaging in misleading advertising by claiming to offer a discount to “the first 50 WeWork members moving into a Codi space.”
WeWork also alleged that Codi’s campaign is “rife with false and misleading statements about WeWork’s offerings,” including “disparaging” language suggesting that WeWork offices are “far from where most people live,” and that the company “does little to serve local communities directly.”
WeWork also alleged that Codi’s allegations that certain WeWork locations are closing are false and that it has not acquired the necessary permits to post signage and staff outside of its offices in New York City.
The letter requested that Codi “immediately and permanently remove and discontinue all use of and references to the WeWork Brand in any form, format or style, including without limitation uses of the WeWork trademark and any confusingly similar terms such as stylized renderings of the term ‘WeWont.’ ”

https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/17/tech-layoffs-2023-list/,A comprehensive list of 2023 tech layoffs,"A comprehensive list of 2023 tech layoffs From major layoffs at Google, Amazon and Microsoft to small fintech startups and apps
Last year’s techwide reckoning continues. The tech industry has seen more than 240,000 jobs lost in 2023, a total that’s already 50% higher than last year and growing. Earlier this year, mass workforce reductions were driven by the biggest names in tech like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Yahoo, Meta and Zoom. Startups across many sectors also announced cutbacks through the first half of the year. And while tech layoffs slowed down in the summer and fall, it appears that cuts are ramping up yet again.
The reason for workforce reductions often follow a common script: the macroeconomic environment, cost-cutting plans and restructuring while on a tumultuous path to profitability.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/17/gm-delays-4b-ev-truck-factory-plan-by-another-year/,GM delays $4B EV truck factory plan by another year,"General Motors is pushing its $4 billion plan to convert its Orion Assembly plant into an EV truck factory to late 2025, a year later than scheduled.
GM’s reasoning behind the delay — which will mean Orion will sit idle for two years — is “to better manage capital investment while aligning with evolving EV demand,” the company said in a statement sent to TechCrunch. The company also said it’s identified engineering improvements that will be implemented to increase profitability of its products.
In other words, EV demand has changed and maybe isn’t as strong as expected. That softening demand, which we’ve seen at other companies such as Lucid’s deliveries numbers reported Tuesday, is forcing automakers to adjust timelines and plans to pour billions into new factories or conversions of existing ones.
GM’s Orion Assembly Plant, with some 1,271 employees, is currently where the Chevy Bolt and Chevy Bolt EUV are assembled. GM plans to end production of those two vehicles at the end of the year. Union employees at Orion will be offered other jobs in Michigan, including positions at Factory ZERO Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly, where the GMC Hummer EV pickup and SUV, Chevrolet Silverado EV and Cruise Origin are being produced. Factory ZERO workers will also start making the GMC Sierra EV next year. GM said production at this facility has been increasing with plans to add a second shift in 2024.
GM announced in January 2022 it would invest $4 billion to convert the Orion factory to produce electric trucks using the GM-developed Ultium Platform. The project, as originally outlined, would include expanding the existing facility, adding new body and paint shops as well as new general assembly and battery pack assembly areas.
That conversion is part of a larger $7 billion investment in four Michigan factories focused on battery cell and electric truck manufacturing, including a third plant with partner LG Energy Solutions.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OrionAssembly02.jpg?resize=1200,800",2023-10-17 19:20:37
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/17/when-was-the-last-time-marc-andreessen-talked-to-a-poor-person/,When was the last time Marc Andreessen talked to a poor person?,"Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen posted a manifesto on the a16z website, calling for “techno-optimism” in a frenzied, 5,000-word blog post that somehow manages to re-invent Reaganomics, propose the colonization of outer space and unironically answer a question with the phrase “QED.”
Andreessen’s vision of techno-optimism could seem inspiring: He imagines a Libertarian-esque world where technology solves all of our problems, poverty and climate change are eradicated, and an honest meritocracy reigns supreme. Though Andreessen may call us “Communists and Luddites” for saying so, his dreams are unrealistic, and founded upon a flawed premise that tech exclusively makes the world better.
First, we need to remember the biases that Andreessen brings to the table, mainly that he is absurdly wealthy (worth an estimated $1.35 billion as of September 2022) and that his absurd wealth is largely tied to the investments of his namesake tech venture fund. So, he inherently is going to push for his techno-optimist vision, because the success of tech companies means he gets even more rich. When you have a financial stake in something, you become biased: This is why, as reporters, we can’t buy Netflix stock, then turn around and write an article about why Netflix is going to have a great Q4.
But money can be blinding. Early on in his essay, Andreessen writes, “We believe that there is no material problem – whether created by nature or by technology – that cannot be solved with more technology.” A16z is increasingly investing in defense companies, including Palmer Luckey’s controversial startup Anduril, which manufactures autonomous weapons. Is war the problem these companies are solving? What does “solve” even mean in the context of conflicts like the ongoing war in Israel and Gaza — isn’t the true solution an end to conflict?
Another inconsistency lies in Andreessen’s assertion that “technological innovation in a market system is inherently philanthropic, by a 50:1 ratio.” He references economist William Nordhaus’ claim that those who create technology only retain 2% of its economic value, so the other 98% “flows through to society.”
“Who gets more value from a new technology, the single company that makes it, or the millions or billions of people who use it to improve their lives?” asks Andreessen.
We won’t lie and say that tech startups have not made our lives easier. If we’re out too late and the subway isn’t running, we can take an Uber or Lyft. If we want to buy a book and get it delivered to our doors by the end of the day, we can order it on Amazon. But to deny the negative impacts of these companies is to move through the world with blinders up.
Furthermore, it’s implicit — but not stated in Andreessen’s argument — that these platforms have effectively made large swatches of society renters, and the platforms, the landlords. Perhaps he needs a refresher on the ills of the “rentier economy” and how antithetical it is to innovators and entrepreneurship?
When was the last time Marc Andreessen walked through the streets of San Francisco, where wealthy tech workers pretend that they don’t see the homeless encampments outside of their companies’ HQ?
When was the last time Marc Andreessen talked to a poor person — or an Instacart shopper struggling to make ends meet, for that matter?
Andreessen’s argument is a contemporary rehashing of trickle-down economics, the notorious Reagan-era idea that as rich people get richer, some of that wealth will “trickle down” to the poor. But this theory has been repeatedly debunked. Again: Do Amazon warehouse workers really get their fair share?
At one point, Andreessen makes the case that free markets “prevent monopolies” because the “market naturally disciplines.” As any third-party Amazon seller will tell you — or anyone who’s tried to get Eras Tour tickets — this is a point easily disproved. Andreessen may argue that the U.S. market isn’t truly “free” in the sense that it’s regulated by agencies and the lawmakers who empower those agencies to enforce policy. But the U.S. has had its fair share of stretches of laissez-faire tech oversight, and each has spawned — not stifled — tech giants strongly inclined to crush competition.
Andreessen’s motivations are further crystalized when he makes a list of whom he considers to be his enemies.
In that section, he lists off what he feels has subjugated society to “mass demoralization.” On this list is a mention of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the 17 objectives that were created to inspire nations to strive toward peace. According to Andreessen, these are the so-called enemies “against technology and life:” environmental sustainability, reduced gender inequalities, the elimination of poverty or hunger, and more good jobs.
How are these 17 goals against technology and life, when technology is already being used to achieve more life — already being used to make clean water, alleviate mass production and generate clean energy? He has a vague, empty way of writing that leaves more questions than answers; it brings forth the idea that he has probably never read the 17 Sustainable Goals, and that instead he is using it as a code word for something else. Then, Andreessen decries ESG stakeholder capitalism, tech ethics, trust and safety, and risk management as enemies to his cause.
What are you really trying to say, Marc? That regulation and accountability are bad? That we should pursue the development of technology at the expense of all else, in hopes that the world will be better if Amazon stock breaks $200 per share?
Andreessen has a coded way of speaking in general, so it’s no wonder that he takes such umbrage with the UN’s goals of supporting those most at risk. He talks about the planet being “dramatically underpopulated” and specifically calls out the way “developed societies” are dwindling in population, a seeming endorsement of one of the core tenets of pronatalism. He wants 50 billion people to be on earth (and then for some of us to colonize outer space), and says the “markets” can generate the money needed to fund social welfare programs. (We must repeat the question: Has this man been to San Francisco lately?) He also mentions that Universal Basic Income “would turn people into zoo animals to be farmed by the state.” (Sam Altman would no doubt disagree.) He wants us to work, to be productive, “to be proud.”
The missing link here is how we can use tech to actually take care of people; how to feed them, clothe them, how to make sure the planet doesn’t reach such high temperatures that we all just melt away. What is missing here is that San Francisco is already the tech hub of the world and is one of the most unequal places in the universe, both socially and economically. What is missing here is that the technological revolution made it easier to hail an Uber or order food delivery, but did nothing about how those drivers and delivery people are being exploited, and how some live in their cars to sustain a decent wage.
There are lines and lines to analyze in his manifesto, but it all goes back to the point that what’s missing here is life: the element of living and all its nuances. He takes an either “you are for technology” or “against it” approach to actually utilizing productivity to help make lives better. He talks about the economic frameworks that life is spun around, without mentioning the intricate ways it actually impacts people.
Plenty of tech giants speak of creating a world they have no grasp on. We watch as Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg “moves fast and breaks things” and then ends up testifying before Congress about election interference. We watch as OpenAI founder Sam Altman draws parallels between himself and Robert Oppenheimer, not stopping to think so much about whether or not it’s a good thing to push the limits of technological innovation at any cost.
Andreessen is a product — and an engineer — of a tech bubble that doesn’t understand the people whom it purports to serve.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/gettyimages-604311102.jpg?resize=1200,798",2023-10-17 18:32:23

We should note that while some of the data about Latin America, sourced from startup data providers focused on the region Sling Hub and Distrito, illustrates a few positive trends, other data points in a more negative direction. We cannot say that Q3 2023 has been a great time for startups — even when squinting and focusing only on a small collection of countries. Far from it.
But any good news is worth the attention at a time when the American IPO window has shut down again, venture activity is slowing, and global tensions are running high as conflicts burn around the world. So this morning, we’re looking at what’s good and what’s not so good in the Latin American venture market.
Investors are tiptoeing back into Latin America
According to data from Sling Hub and Itaú BBA, Latin American startups raised $2.5 billion in the third quarter of 2023. Equity funding made up $1.5 billion of that total — that’s notable because Sling pointed out that overall funding, inclusive of non-equity capital, was down 26% in the year by its calculation, while equity-based fundraising actually ticked up 13% compared to a year earlier.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-103938409.jpg?resize=1200,782",2023-10-17 18:25:17

How to fundraise when your deep tech startup sounds like sci-fi
People who build startups have it tough already, but what if their startup sounds like something out of “The Matrix”? VCs want to invest in the next hot thing, and if they’re not sure about a company’s value prop, they might not be quick to pull out their checkbooks.
It’s a founder’s job to explain how and what their product does, especially if their deep tech startup straddles two sectors. Seraphim Space’s Maureen Haverty offers a few tips on how to make a deep tech startup seem more credible when everything about it screams “science fiction.”
African startups see their fundraising prospects dry up as capital availability falls yet again in Q3
Last quarter didn’t look so hot for African startups as funding trends fell back to what we’re calling “pre-COVID norms.”
But it’s not all doom and gloom: Although there was less money to go around, more startups in the region got funding. And we were pleasantly surprised that the company that got the most funding in Q3 is not a fintech.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/17/reddit-is-phasing-out-community-points-blockchain-rewards/,Reddit is killing blockchain-based Community Points,"Reddit is winding down Community Points — the blockchain-based “internet points” program designed to reward creators and developers — in favor of prioritizing rewards programs that are less difficult to scale.
“Though we saw some future opportunities for Community Points, the resourcing needed was unfortunately too high to justify,” Reddit’s director of consumer and product communications Tim Rathschmidt told TechCrunch. “The regulatory environment has since added to that effort. Though the moderators and communities that supported Community Points have been incredible partners — as it’s evolved, the product is no longer set up to scale.”
Community Points, which will be phased out by early November, were promoted as a chance for Redditors to “own” a piece of their community. First launched in 2020, Community Points were awarded to users who positively engaged in select subreddits in order to incentivize better content and conversation. The points were essentially interchangeable Ethereum tokens stored in Reddit’s Vault, which operated as a cryptocurrency wallet.
Once awarded, neither Reddit nor moderators could take back another user’s Community Points. The points could be used on special features, like memberships that unlocked unique badges and animated emojis. Once spent, the points were “burned.”
As a measure of “reputation,” Community Points were displayed next to usernames in participating subreddits to mark the community’s biggest contributors. Since the points were on the blockchain, the program aimed to allow users to display their “reputation” anywhere online, and could be embedded in other sites or apps. If users were banned from Reddit, their points would still exist on the blockchain, but they would lose access to their Vault — rendering the points useless.
But scaling Community Points proved to be an immense challenge for Reddit. The pilot program originally used Ethereum, which had high transaction fees and limited bandwidth.
“Putting all Reddit users on the main Ethereum network, for example, would be infeasible and prohibitively expensive,” the Community Points page said. “Therefore, we have researched heavily into solutions that are decentralized, secure and yet highly scalable.”
Reddit moved Community Points to Arbitrum Nova in 2022, which is built “on top” of Ethereum.
“This enables it to apply scaling technologies that enable ultra-low-cost transactions, very high energy efficiency and strong security guarantees,” the FAQ stated.
But even that was impractical for Reddit. In the years since launching Community Points, Reddit has rolled out a number of community incentives, like the moderator rewards program and the Contributor Program, which awards actual money by allowing eligible users to convert their Reddit gold and karma into cash. Under the Contributor Program, Redditors who earn at least 10 gold within a 30-day period are eligible for a monthly withdrawal. Reddit users who have over 5,000 karma (total upvotes) can earn $1 per gold.
“We’re still working on ways to improve community governance and empower communities and contributions,” Rathschmidt said. “Part of why we’re moving past this product is that we’ve already launched, or are actively investing in, several products that accomplish what the Community Points program was trying to accomplish, while being easier to adopt and understand.”
He added that the special features that Community Points can buy, like gifs, should be available to any community. Once the program is fully phased out, beta participants will no longer see their points in their Vaults, and will no longer earn points in their communities. Although Rathschmidt said he couldn’t give an exact count of the number of subreddits affected by the cut, he admitted that “you’d be able to count them on one hand and have a finger or two left over.”
It’s not the only rewards program that Reddit has killed this year. Earlier this year, Reddit announced the end of its coin system, which allowed users to purchase Gold and other currency to award other users. The announcement came in the aftermath of the sitewide protests against Reddit’s API changes, which culminated in a 48-hour blackout of over 8,000 subreddits, and was wildly unpopular among Reddit’s already jaded users. Awards and existing coins under the previous reward program were available until mid-September. Reddit announced the Contributor Program later that month.
Rathschmidt noted that the company isn’t phasing out Community Points to make way for the Contributor Program, but rather to prioritize on programs that are “more set up to scale and benefit more users,” like the Contributor Program.
“It’s one example. Now, we’re able to scale several products that accomplish what the Community Points program was trying to accomplish — like subreddit karma and gifs,” he continued. “Many of the benefits of Community Points have already been built into the platform.”","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/reddit.jpg?resize=1200,800",2023-10-17 17:41:08
https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/17/trust-safety-tycoon-lets-you-simulate-the-most-agonizing-job-in-tech/,Trust & Safety Tycoon lets you simulate the most agonizing job in tech,"If you think you could’ve deflected Twitter’s blue check impersonation debacle, then boy do we have the game for you! Techdirt has released the very fun and not at all stressful game Trust & Safety Tycoon, in which you get to simulate running a trust & safety team at a Twitter-like social media startup called Yapper.
Created alongside the Atlantic Council’s Task Force for a Trustworthy Future Web, Trust & Safety Tycoon forces the player to confront the challenging trade-offs of keeping an online platform safe — is off-platform harassment grounds for banning a user? Is use of offensive slang okay if it’s being used by members of the group the slang refers to? Can you allow bots on the platform without devolving into a haven for crypto spam? Can you build a policy around political misinformation without showing bias toward one political party or another?
These questions are less complex in a theoretical vacuum — but in this game, you have to maintain solid user growth, ad revenue, moderation speed and team morale. And even if you can accomplish that, your CEO might lose confidence in you and give you the axe when you make a wrong choice regarding the fate of a provocateur named “BatDung” (yes, this happened to me). Then, you’ll field requests from local law enforcement who want you to let a suspected murderer continue livestreaming on Yapper so that the police can figure out where he’s located. And if you can get through that mess, then you’ll have to figure out how to abide by changing international laws without turning over activists’ user data to authoritarian governments.
By the time you finish the game, you’re given the option to keep working at Yapper, start your own company, consult for the government or go into an early retirement. If you don’t choose the option of buying a mountain chalet and adopting a puppy, you’re stronger than I am.
The game is difficult: In my first attempt, I was fired before we reached a Series B because my cautious moderation decisions deflated our user growth and ad revenue. Still, it’s entertaining (though perhaps not as entertaining as Rollercoaster Tycoon) and gives you a renewed understanding of how difficult it is to run a social media platform. Though some moderation scenarios are funny — you’re tasked with determining if replying “OK Boomer” to older users is harassment, or if Bronies are a threat to the safety of minors — many scenarios feel urgent, reflecting the real legislation that is passing through Congress as we speak. Can individual states ban TikTok? Can you protect children from seeing porn without requiring all internet users to verify their age and identity? We’ll see how this plays out in the real world.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-17-at-12.36.16-PM.png?resize=1200,610",2023-10-17 17:06:39
https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/barriers-to-solar-energy-transition-identified-researchers/38395/,Barriers to solar energy transition identified by researchers,"In a study led by the University of Exeter and University College London, researchers have found four barriers to solar energy that must be resolved by the government.
The four barriers to solar energy are the creation of stable power grids, financing solar in developing economies, capacity of supply chains, and political resistance from regions that lose jobs.
Policies to resolve these barriers are thought to be more effective than price instruments such as carbon taxes in accelerating the clean energy transition.
The study, ‘The momentum of the solar energy transition,’ is part of the Economics of Energy Innovation and System Transition project, funded by the UK Government’s Department for Energy Security and Net Zero and the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF).
Solar PV is set to become the dominant power source
Based on a data-driven model of technology and economics, the study found that solar PV is expected to dominate the global power mix before 2050.
Solar energy is projected to become our main energy source, even without support from more ambitious climate policies.
Dr Femke Nijsse, from Exeter’s Global Systems Institute, said: “The recent progress of renewables means that fossil fuel-dominated projections are no longer realistic.
“In other words, we have avoided the ‘business as usual’ scenario for the power sector.
“However, older projections often rely on models that see innovation as something happening outside of the economy.
“In reality, there is a virtuous cycle between technologies being deployed and companies learning to do so more cheaply.
“When you include this cycle in projections, you can represent the rapid growth of solar in the past decade and into the future.
“Traditional models also tend to assume the ‘end of learning’ at some point in the near future – when in fact we are still seeing very rapid innovation in solar technology.
“Using three models that track positive feedbacks, we project that solar PV will dominate the global energy mix by the middle of this century.”
Four barriers to solar energy
However, energy systems dominated by solar energy could become “locked into configurations that are neither resilient nor sustainable, with a reliance on fossil fuel for dispatchable power.”
The government must therefore overcome the barriers to solar energy, rather than trying to bring about the solar transition in itself. These key barriers are:
Grid resilience
Solar generation is variable so processes must be put into place to deal with the variability. To build resilience instead of burning fossil fuels, the government could invest in other renewables, transmission cables linking different regions, and electricity storage and policy to manage demand.
The study stated that government subsidies and funding for research and development are important for initially creating grid resilience.
Access to finance
Another barrier to the solar energy transition is the availability of finance. Currently, low-carbon finance is concentrated in high-income countries.
International funding favours middle-income countries, leaving low-income countries deficient in solar finance despite the huge potential for investment.
Critical minerals supply chains
The solar energy transition requires many critical minerals, causing demand to increase.
It is estimated that renewable technologies will make up 40% of total mineral demand for copper and rare earth elements, between 60 and 70% for nickel and cobalt, and around 90% for lithium by 2040.
Securing a sustainable supply chain of these materials is a major challenge.
Political opposition
The final barrier to solar energy is resistance from declining industries. The pace of the solar energy transition depends on both the economic decisions of entrepreneurs and how desirable policymakers consider it.
If the solar energy transition is to accelerate quickly, the livelihood of around 13 million people working in fossil fuel industries globally may be put at risk.
Regional economic and industrial development policies can mitigate risks posed by resistance from declining industries.
These four barriers must be overcome to facilitate the solar energy transition, and to ensure that net zero goals are met.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/shutterstockKampan_1614874936.jpg,2023-10-18 09:58:17
https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/urgent-action-is-needed-to-tackle-the-plastic-recycling-postcode-lottery/36152/,Urgent action is needed to tackle the plastic recycling ‘postcode lottery’,"The University of Manchester ‘One Bin to Rule Them All’ project team outline how implementing a new plastic recycling system in the UK could improve participation rates.
Our ineffectiveness at recycling plastic packaging waste is causing a significant environmental problem.
Of the 2.5 million tonnes of plastic waste generated in the UK in 2021, just 44% was recycled and over 60% was sent abroad, exporting the problem of plastic waste to countries that often do not have the ability to re-use or dispose of this waste sustainably.
Recent years have seen consumers bombarded with campaigns promoting the importance of recycling, in an attempt drive up participation rates. However, whilst the intention and effort of such policies are welcome, they have had little success.
And, as shown in a new report written by The University of Manchester’s ‘One Bin to Rule Them All‘ project team – which involves a cross-sector consortium of 25 industry partners and local authorities – the blame does not in fact lie with consumers, but with the convoluted nature of the recycling system.
Trialling a ‘one bin for all plastics’ system
Our research involved trialling a ‘one bin for all plastics’ system, which saw 30 households get a separate bin for all of their plastic waste for a two-week period.
This allowed the project team to explore how consumers engage with recycling, and showed that the blame levelled against households for poor quality recycling is largely misplaced.
Indeed, most households are eager to do the right thing, with numerous respondents demonstrating a willingness to go above and beyond to correctly dispose of their plastic.
So, what needs to change to make sure their efforts don’t go to waste?
Low recycling rates are driven by confusion over rules
The research found that the key driver of low recycling rates is confusion over rules as to what can and can’t be thrown away – and with an estimated 39 differing bin regimes currently in place across the UK, as well as 3,500 waste recycling plants with varying capabilities in infrastructure, it’s understandable why.
Described as a ‘postcode lottery’, this siloed and fragmented system has caused a lack of clarity over correct procedure, whilst the inability of some local authorities to process certain plastics holds back consumers from recycling what may be possible to recycle elsewhere.
Introducing a standardised approach to plastic recycling
A first step in tackling this would involve the adoption of a standardised approach to plastic recycling, to allow for a consistent method of waste management across the country.
Two years ago, the government outlined plans to do just that, by introducing nationwide consistency in recycling standards by October this year. However, in a new ‘waste prevention programme’ published in July, officials quietly confirmed that consistent recycling collections would be delayed until late 2025.
This is a huge blow. Introducing recycling consistency could create a platform on which the government can begin to effectively deliver the transition towards a circular economy of plastic waste, and these plans should be prioritised rather than kicked further down the road.
Crucially, it is worth noting that the onus does not lie solely on government or local authorities. Consistency in collection can only be truly effective if packaging designers and plastic producers adopt a large-scale, standardised approach to manufacturing.
Multi-material packaging is much harder to recycle
The 30 households involved in the ‘One Bin’ project trial disposed of a total of 5,800 pieces of plastic over the two-week trial period. Of this total, nearly half of the items collected consisted of multi-material packaging.
Made up of a combination of materials, these are much harder to recycle, with their inconsistency in composition meaning that a lot more plastic ends up in the general bin instead of being collected for reuse.
Maximising the recycling of such materials will involve simplifying their design and disposal. In this regard, delivering any real change would require broad adoption across sectors. This may take some time to co-ordinate, but it would pay dividends by increasing the amount of high-quality recycled plastic that can be used in packaging moving forward.
The research shows the willingness for change amongst consumers, but we need to ensure the infrastructure is in place to support this. The issue can no longer be ignored if the UK is to truly achieve its sustainability goals.

https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/developing-responsible-sources-of-magnet-metals-at-the-monte-muambe-project/38352/,Developing responsible magnet metals at the Monte Muambe project,"Altona Rare Earths tell us about the state of magnet metals and provides an update on their Monte Muambe project.
Rare earths are a group of 17 chemical elements. Each of these elements has its own properties, uses, and prices. Among other uses, four elements – neodymium, praseodymium, terbium, and dysprosium, collectively known as the ‘magnet metals’ – are necessary for the manufacturing of high-performance permanent magnets.
By volume, permanent magnets represent about 50% of the world’s rare earth consumption. By value, they represent more than 95%.
Ryan Castilloux, the founder of Adamas Intelligence, recently revealed that nine out of ten electric vehicles (EV) deployed during September 2023 were permanent magnet synchronous motors or magnet-assisted synchronous reluctant motors. Both types contain rare earth magnets.
The same company forecasts that the current supply deficit of neodymium-praseodymium oxide will grow from a few thousand tons currently to 90,000 tons per year by 2040.
Magnet metals are already an essential raw material for many industrial and high-technology applications. They are critical to the decarbonisation of the world’s energy sources through the production of EV drive trains and wind turbines. While alternatives exist, these have drawbacks in terms of performance and cost that make them second choices.
The share of EV and wind turbines in the consumption of magnet metals is set to grow during the next decades, driven by the green energy transition and policy changes aimed at implementing it.
Altona Rare Earths’ acquisition strategy
Altona Rare Earths is a British mineral resources exploration and development company specialised in rare earths and focussed on Africa. The company joined the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange on 9 June 2023.
Altona Rare Earths started to implement its rare earths project acquisition strategy in early 2020 and reviewed different projects in various African jurisdictions, applying its strict selection criteria.
In 2021, the company settled on the Monte Muambe carbonatite-hosted rare earths deposit, located in the Tete Province in the Northwest part of Mozambique. The project now has a maiden JORC Mineral Resource Estimate published, and a Scoping Study will soon be completed.
Taking advantage of its position in Africa, its networks, and its knowledge of the African continent’s geology, Altona Rare Earths continues to assess new potential project acquisition opportunities and expects to add at least one other rare earths project to its portfolio over the next year.
Africa’s geological history
The African continent has a long and complex geological history, which has been favourable to the development of rare earth deposits over time. The crustal abundance of rare earths is of the same order of magnitude as that of metals such as copper, vanadium, and lead.
However, economically viable concentrations are rare, and they are found in very different geological environments.
The main sources of rare earths are carbonatites, ionic clay deposits, and heavy mineral sands. The grade of rare earth deposits is expressed as total rare earth oxide (TREO), either as a percentage or in parts per million (ppm).
Ionic clay deposits typically have a low grade, usually ranging from 500 to 2,000 ppm TREO (0.05 to 0.2% TREO), which is compensated for by lower development and exploitation costs, and they can be exploited on a small scale. Carbonatite deposits such as Monte Muambe have higher grades, typically ranging from 1-10% TREO, but have higher development and exploitation costs.
Assessing a rare earths project is difficult
Rare earth projects are relatively new to the mining industry. Production currently originates mostly from a few carbonatite mines in China, one in Australia, and one in the United States, as well as a flurry of small-scale ionic clay deposits in Southeast China and neighbouring countries.
Therefore, when benchmarking a rare earths project, it is difficult to compare with existing operations, and comparisons are more easily made with advanced projects at the definitive feasibility study stage.
However, the complexity of rare earth deposits is such that every deposit is different in terms of geology, mineralogy, metallurgy, and costs. Therefore, comparisons also have their limitations.
While assessing a rare earths project, it is also important to distinguish between mineral resources, which represent the quantity of minerals contained in the ground, from ore reserves, which show the quantity of minerals viably extractable, as demonstrated in a feasibility study.
For example, mineral resource statements for carbonatite rare earth deposits can reach several hundreds of millions of tons, but the ore reserve statements for such projects rarely exceed 30 million tons.
An update on the Monte Muambe project
Since 2021, Altona Rare Earths has carried out several drilling campaigns at Monte Muambe, as well as soil sampling and ground geophysical surveys. Over 100 boreholes have been drilled for a total of more than 7,800m. This focused exploration work has allowed the company to discover and define two significant orebodies, referred to as Target 1 and Target 4.
On 25 September 2023, Altona Rare Earths announced its maiden JORC Mineral Resource Estimate for the Monte Muambe project, totalling 13.6 million tons at 2.42% TREO. This includes 45,000 tons of Magnet Metals oxides. This result provides a solid base for a mining project, and the tonnage is expected to increase through additional drilling during the pre-feasibility study without reducing the grade.
Importantly, about 58% of the resource’s tonnage belongs to the Indicated category (the rest being inferred), which demonstrates a high level of confidence in the resource figures. This is in line with the company’s strategy to avoid ‘drilling for numbers’ and rather to focus on defining the mineral resources that can be converted into an ore reserve and ultimately into a mining operation, from the onset.
So far, the Monte Muambe project ticks all the boxes of a low strip ratio open-pit mining operation.
Altona Rare Earths is now about to publish a scoping study, which will give a first pass test of economic viability for the project. The completion of this important milestone will allow Altona Rare Earths to increase its holding of the project to 51%, thus further de-risking the project for its shareholders.
The new challenges of the supply chain
While about 40% of rare earths mining is done outside of China, this country clearly dominates the supply chain, with over 90% of the separation, refining, and conversion of oxide to metal and magnet manufacturing being done in China. The country has heavily invested over the past 30 years, both domestically and abroad, to create this dominance. This has created a situation of dependence on China for other nations, not just for the supply of permanent magnets and EVs but also for critical high-technology applications such as within the communications and defence industries.
Western countries have recently started to recognise this situation and its associated risks, and are reacting by putting in place policies to develop domestic, or at least China-independent, supply chains for rare earths and other critical minerals. Rare earth processing facilities are starting to appear outside of China and will reduce the reliance on China. These changes will take time but will happen. They will, in our opinion, ultimately lead to the integration of Chinese and non-Chinese supply chains rather than their separation and to a more balanced market with more stable rare earths prices.
However, developing rare earth mines in the West, such as Europe, is proving to be a lot more difficult. This is because there are not many mineable rare earth deposits in Europe and also because the regulatory and social environment in Europe has, over time, become very adverse to mining.
The role of African, Asian, and South American countries hosting rare earths and other critical mineral resources will become essential to ensuring supplies of rare earths to both Chinese and non-Chinese markets. Africa has a long history of producing raw minerals, which have been exported to be processed and transformed in other countries. There is a strong sentiment in Africa that this must stop. Several countries have put in place bans on raw mineral products exports.
It is essential for mineral project developers to take this changing environment into consideration and integrate in-country value addition as much as possible. This is best done by starting to assess opportunities for value addition at an early stage in the life of projects rather than when reaching the final stages of the feasibility studies.
However, ultimately, the viability of a project depends on whether it can be economically implemented or not. African Governments therefore have a duty to put in place favourable conditions and lift obstacles to such value addition projects.
Another important angle in the developing rare earths supply chains is that of responsible sourcing. Western supply chains typically want to be able to guarantee to their customers, especially the end consumers, that the raw materials used to manufacture products have been extracted with no harm to people or the environment.
Responsible sourcing systems have previously been put in place, with more-or-less success, for minerals such as diamond or columbo-tantalite. Responsible sourcing is bound to become a topic of major importance in the development of critical minerals supply chains. Large and well-managed rare earth projects such as Monte Muambe can be certified and audited by responsible sourcing organisations, contrary to Southeast China artisan ionic clay operations, which are very environmentally destructive.
The outlook for 2024 at Monte Muambe
Buoyed by a rare earths market with solid long-term fundamentals and highly encouraging exploration results at Monte Muambe, including the recently published mineral resource estimate, Altona Rare Earths looks forward to a busy 2024 with the preparation of a pre-feasibility study for Monte Muambe.
A lot of emphasis will be put on the metallurgy part of the project and fine-tuning the process flow chart.
The increase of the company’s holding in the project to 51%, as well as securing a mining concession, are also important milestones that will happen during this time frame and will contribute greatly to de-risking Monte Muambe.

https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/navigating-turbulent-waters-modern-cyber-security-threats/38374/,Navigating the turbulent waters of modern cyber security threats,"Kamal Srinivasan, SVP of Product and Program Management at Parallels (part of Alludo), explains that technological advances require new approaches to dealing with cyber security threats.
“The only constant in life is change.” I’m very sure that when Heraclitus said this, he was not referring to the ever-changing cyber security landscape. But had he been, he would have been spot on. In the rapidly evolving technological realm of cyber security, the conventional approach to addressing cyber security threats that businesses face is no longer sufficient.
With the increased reliance upon technology to help businesses meet their internal and external goals, there is a necessity for a more robust and adaptive approach towards cyber security.
According to a recent survey by Alludo – in partnership with Qualtrics, featuring nearly 500 IT professionals, eight out of ten respondents stated that security is a top priority. Even still, with this increased importance placed upon cyber security, there were more than 79 million breached records in August alone.
It’s clear to see that the desire is there from companies to attack cyber security threats head-on, yet still, it wouldn’t be out of the ordinary to wonder why many cyber security breaches take place.
Technology is evolving faster than ever before
From cloud computing to Artificial Intelligence, the recent developments made in technology have led businesses from numerous sectors to implement new technologies to improve all aspects of business operations and customer satisfaction.
However, whilst doing this, reaping the benefits and capabilities of these technological advancements, they also at times inadvertently leave themselves exposed to cyber security threats.
An increased demand from both customers and employees for a more contactless on-demand experience has led businesses to invest in technology to meet both parties’ desires. At an ever-growing rate, cloud computing is being adopted to make data more readily available when customers and employees desire it.
41.4% of IT leaders reported that they were increasing their use of the cloud. A further 32.8% announced they were migrating on-premises workloads to the cloud.
This sudden shift to the cloud has undeniably improved operations for businesses from a productivity, flexibility, and collaborative standpoint.
Nevertheless, it has also left behind traditional security enterprise controls, rooted in the firewall-centric approach, making it increasingly more apparent that such and often used cyber security approaches can’t keep up with the new dynamic landscape.
There is no denying that in the future, the cloud will become more prominent in the way that businesses operate. Although IT decision-makers from businesses may be reluctant to do so, it is time to let go of the old and outdated cyber security measures and put in place newer approaches such as the Zero-Trust Architecture (ZTA). This approach operates under the principles that all entities are untrusted by default, least privileged access is enforced, and comprehensive security monitoring is implemented as is a core foundational requirement of secure remote access.
A ZTA approach challenges traditional thought processes and ways of working by assuming ‘trust in good, but control is better.’ This means that no user or system should be inherently trusted, no matter their location within or outside the network. Addressing the limitations of traditional enterprise controls and extending protective measures beyond the typical boundaries.
Double trouble: Tackling dual cyber security threats in a connected world
If the last few years have shown business leaders and IT decision-makers anything it’s that the future is unpredictable. Take the most conventional form of working now. No one would have thought that 47% of all workers would be hybrid and a further 11% were fully remote before the pandemic. But that’s where we currently find ourselves today.
The increase in employees working from both a hybrid and remote capacity though has had positives, it has also increased the chances of businesses falling victim to cyber security threats from a dual perspective. It shouldn’t be a surprise that with all the potential security threats out there such as phishing attacks, organisations plan to increase their security expenditures. 78% of IT leaders reported that they planned to up their security budgets either moderately or significantly in the coming year.
As all professional sectors increasingly become interconnected and work no longer has to be confined specifically to one place, it wouldn’t be a surprise if mobile devices and cloud computing become integral components of business operations. If they’re not already.
Bearing all of this in mind, businesses must invest in the necessary technologies such as remote application servers and remote browser isolation to deal with both external cyber security threats whilst employees work away from home.
In tandem with implementing the necessary technology, businesses should also implement a culture where all decisions by employees relating to data take into consideration the cyber security risks. Having principles as such whilst leveraging the right technology, gives businesses the best chance of not falling victim to cyber attacks.
The battle in the landscape will be continuous
According to IT professionals, the top three external threats to sensitive data in their organisations were malware and ransomware attacks (64%), cloud vulnerabilities (42%), and phishing attacks (38%). This isn’t a surprise considering the fact the dependability that has been placed on certain technologies such as the cloud.
But with the increased developments in other areas within the technological landscape, such as in AI, it wouldn’t be surprising if new avenues and loopholes arise for cyber attacks to take place.
So even though 59% of IT leaders have not experienced a security breach, organisations should not rest on their laurels. In today’s reality of hybrid and remote work, along with technological developments means that organisations must be forever alert and take a holistic approach to cyber security to adapt to the ever-changing landscape.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/shutterstockGorodenkoff_2136788157.jpg,2023-10-18 07:52:54
https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/digibuild-project-high-quality-data-driven-services-digital-built-environment/36291/,DigiBUILD Project: High-quality data-driven services for a digital built environment,"The DigiBUILD Project combines Big Data and Artificial Intelligence tools with the aim of making the EU’s building stock climate neutral.
It might sound shocking to many that more than 75% of the European Union’s (EU) building stock is not considered energy efficient. The vast majority (75-90%) of these energy-intensive buildings standing today will still be in use in 2050, given that the construction rate is low overall. Low demolition and renovation rates also lead to an inexorably ageing building stock, with 75% of it built before 1990. Since the building sector accounts for nearly 40% of the total energy consumption in the EU, we shall move fast.
On the policy level, EU officials have raised the energy density reduction of the building sector quite high in their agenda. The EU’s climate policy is underpinned by a number of European Directives which set strict objectives on Member States for building stock energy performance. The building renovation is included as well as in several high-profile policy initiatives.
The EU must accelerate the number of deep renovations (with expected savings of 60% or more) and increase the rate of retrofitting (more than 2% per year) to improve the performance of the building stock, and at the same time reduce the pressure on the energy grids. In this respect, evidence-based decision support is required for sound planning on retrofitting. This is what the innovative DigiBUILD services will help with. The DigiBUILD Project is among the initiatives the European Commission (EC) fosters in order to address this challenging situation.
The crucial role of digitalisation in the building stock
Moving toward smart buildings equipped with digital technologies is fully aligned with the importance of data economy and prioritisation as set by the EC within the strategies ‘Digital Single Market’ and ‘A Europe fit for the digital age’.
Due to the increasing adoption of leading-edge Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)/blockchain and Big Data, more and more data is being generated within buildings.
Data concerns almost every aspect of the built environment, from how individuals and businesses use and interact with properties to how the building’s energy consumption and construction details are recorded and analysed to support informed decisions about construction and real estate processes. Data-informed decision-making and digital upgrading, such as energy conservation measures, can help upyield operational efficiencies at a low cost. The high-quality data services included in the DigiBUILD toolbox will provide support for the decision making process.
What is the vision of the DigiBUILD Project?
To accelerate and achieve the ambitious energy and environmental targets for a climate-neutral building stock, it is crucial to engage a large number of stakeholders from the building’s lifecycle: from conceptualisation and construction to refurbishment and demolition.
The inclusion of all related parties will ensure that the transition towards low-carbon and sustainable living is acceptable and feasible for all. But, how can the built environment be freed from the constraints of current silo thinking?
Traditional silo approaches, where the different building stakeholders access and manage only their own data, can be replaced by digital and smart buildings, merging heterogeneous data sources, and placing all the stakeholders at the core of these buildings in an integrated and comprehensive approach.
The overall vision of the DigiBUILD Project is to catalyse this much-needed transformation by using high-quality data and next-generation digital building services for assuring trust, transparency, and better-informed decision-making processes.
The development of data-driven services
The DigiBUILD consortium will deliver high-quality data-driven services for a digital and sustainable built environment, supporting the deployment of EU-wide framework for a digital building logbook. DigiBUILD is creating an innovative open, interoperable, and cloud-based toolbox to transform current ‘silo’ buildings into digital, interoperable and smarter facilities, based on consistent and reliable data. The strategic objective consists of designing, developing, and deploying a holistic people-centric framework across nine different pilots connected to ten use cases. The latter are clustered by theme into three groups: ‘Buildings Performance’, ‘Buildings vs Infrastructure Optimal Management’ and ‘Policy & Finance’. The use cases are currently being prepared to test the DigiBUILD services which include:
AI-based services for finer-grained energy profiling and forecasting;
Data-driven services for energy resources management;
Data-driven energy and nonenergy services for enhanced comfort and wellbeing;
Data-driven services for renovation roadmaps and energy efficiency financing; and
Decision-making under uncertainty tools for efficient and climate-resilient buildings.
The DigiBUILD project is funded by the European Union under the research and innovation framework programme, ‘Horizon Europe’. The project consortium, led by Engineering Ingegneria Informatica, consists of 17 partner organisations with complementary expertise from the research and industrial area from 11 European countries representing the whole building value chain and more.

The open source machine learning (ML) framework PyTorch is moving forward with a new release, as well as a new project for enabling AI inference at the edge and on mobile devices.
The new developments were announced today at the PyTorch Conference, which loosely coincided with the one year anniversary of the formation of the PyTorch Foundation, at the Linux Foundation. As part of the event, technical details on the PyTorch 2.1 update which was released on Oct. 4, were discussed.
Most notable, however, was the announcement of new mobile and edge efforts with PyTorch Edge and the open sourcing of ExecuTorch by Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook). ExecuTorch is technology for deploying AI models for on-device inference, specifically on mobile and edge devices.
Meta has already proven the technology and is using it to power the latest generation of Ray-Ban smart glasses and it’s also part of the recently released Quest 3 VR headset. As part of the open source PyTorch project the goal is to push the technology further enabling what could be a new era of on-device AI inference capabilities.

During the opening keynote at PyTorch Conference, Ibrahim Haddad, executive director of the PyTorch Foundation outlined the progress the organization has made over the past year.
“At the Linux Foundation we host over 900 technical projects, PyTorch is one of them,” Haddad said. “There are over 900 examples of how a neutral open home for projects help projects grow and PyTorch is a great example of that.”
The expanding capabilities for inference of PyTorch 2.1
PyTorch has long been one of the most widely used tools underpinning training of AI, including many of the world’s most popular large language models (LLMs) including GPT models from OpenAI and Meta’s Llama to name a few.
Historically, PyTorch has not been widely used for inference, but that is now changing. In a recent exclusive with VentureBeat, IBM detailed its efforts and contributions into PyTorch 2.1 that help to improve inference for server deployments.
PyTorch 2.1 also provides performance enhancement that should help to improve operations for the torch.compile function that is at the foundation for the technology. The addition of support for automatic dynamic shapes will minimize the need for recompilations due to tensor shape changes, and Meta developers added support to translate NumPy operations into PyTorch to accelerate certain types of numerical calculations that are commonly used for data science.
ExecuTorch is on a quest to change the game for AI inference
In a keynote session at the PyTorch Conference, Mergen Nachin, Software Engineer at Meta detailed what the new ExecuTorch technology is all about and why it matters.
Nachin said that ExecuTorch is a new end-to-end solution for deploying AI for on-device inference, specifically for mobile and edge devices.
He noted that today’s AI models are extending beyond servers to edge devices such as mobile, AR, VR and AR headsets, wearables, embedded systems and microcontrollers.
ExecuTorch addresses the challenges of restricted edge devices by providing an end-to-end workflow from PyTorch models to deliver optimized native programs.
Nachin explained that ExecuTorch starts with a standard PyTorch module, but coverts it into an exporter graph, and then optimizes it with further transformations and compilations to target specific devices.
A key benefit of ExecuTorch is portability with the ability to run on both mobile and embedded devices. Nachin noted that ExecuTorch can also help to improve developer productivity by using consistent APIs and software development kits across different targets.
ExecuTorch was validated and vetted by actual real-world engineering problems and Meta has already proven the technology with deployment in its Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.
With the technology now being made available as open source as part of the PyTorch Foundation, Nachin said the goal is to help the industry collaboratively address fragmentation in deploying AI models to the wide array of edge devices. Meta believes ExecuTorch can help more organizations take advantage of on-device AI through its optimized and portable workflow.
“Today we are open sourcing ExecuTorch and it’s still very early, but we’re open sourcing because we want to get feedback from the community and embrace the community,” he said.",https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cfr0z3n_a_virtual_reality_headset_displaying_neon_fire_ab1a2c58-33f2-4f0d-ae81-e17de062897d.png?w=1200&strip=all,2023-10-17 22:54:48
