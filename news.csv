Here's the good, the bad, and the ugly","DevOps engineering is currently one of the most sought-after professions in the job market. However, this role requires a combination of technical expertise and business acumen. Furthermore, to excel in this field, one must be committed to continuous learning as popular approaches quickly become outdated.

The demand for DevOps engineers, who are responsible for automating and collaborating on both cloud and on-premises environments to ensure the seamless development and deployment of software, is on the rise. As a result, these professionals are well-compensated, with an average salary of approximately $134,000 per year in the US.

While the role of a DevOps engineer can be rewarding, it also comes with its challenges. According to Brad Morgan, a seasoned DevOps engineer, having a strong understanding of Linux is essential. Regardless of the specific tasks involved in a DevOps role, interfacing with Linux is a fundamental requirement. Morgan emphasizes the importance of familiarity with basic Linux commands, the terminal, and bash scripting, which is widely used in the DevOps world.

Cloud skills are another crucial aspect of being a DevOps engineer. Morgan suggests focusing on one mainstream cloud provider, such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure, to become a master in that specific platform. Being a jack of all trades may not be as valuable as having expertise in a single cloud vendor.

Becoming a DevOps engineer does not require a formal course of study. In fact, self-learning is often the best approach in this field. Morgan stresses the need for constant learning and self-challenge. The DevOps ecosystem is vast and ever-evolving, with tools and frameworks being replaced by newer alternatives. DevOps engineers must always be willing to invest time in studying and keeping up with the latest developments.

""Homebrew Henry,"" another experienced DevOps engineer, echoes the importance of continuous learning in this field. He emphasizes that the pace of development and the introduction of AI tools, such as ChatGPT, will shape the future of DevOps engineering. Therefore, even with experience, the learning never stops.

One aspect that distinguishes passionate DevOps engineers is their enthusiasm for managing infrastructure. Henry warns that if someone is not interested in infrastructure management, they may struggle in this role. DevOps engineers spend a significant amount of time setting up, configuring, and maintaining the cloud infrastructure that supports various applications. This involves dealing with servers, databases, networks, and security on a daily basis. While this may excite some individuals, it may not satisfy others who prefer software engineering and building customer-facing applications.

Fortunately, there are examples of individuals transitioning between software engineering and DevOps roles. It's important to note that choosing one path doesn't mean being locked into it forever.

Lastly, it's essential to consider the business aspect of DevOps. Unrealistic expectations from management can be a challenge in this field. Many businesses believe that hiring a few DevOps engineers will magically solve all their problems. However, this is not the case. DevOps is a multifaceted discipline that requires time, effort, and a holistic understanding of the organization's goals and processes.

In conclusion, DevOps engineering is an exciting and rewarding profession, but it's not without its challenges. To succeed in this field, one must possess a strong foundation in Linux, cloud skills, and a passion for infrastructure management. Continuous learning and adaptability are also crucial. By understanding the demands and intricacies of this role, aspiring DevOps engineers can embark on a fulfilling and successful career path.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/e4d3d8d263eb00323161fcf2566ad35a3fe52282/2024/03/25/1b8b924e-2629-43c2-b416-1b990e262786/gettyimages-1319039490.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.zdnet.com/article/saving-hours-of-work-with-ai-how-chatgpt-became-my-virtual-assistant-for-a-data-project/,Saving hours of work with AI: How ChatGPT became my virtual assistant for a data project,"Generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT have been getting a lot of attention recently. They can be incredibly useful for various projects, saving time and effort. In this article, I'll share my experience using ChatGPT for a specific project and how it helped me streamline my work. While your projects may differ, I hope this will inspire you to explore the potential of ChatGPT as a valuable tool in your own work.

The project I worked on involved creating a ""stunt article"" where I aimed to showcase how much computer gear I could buy from a website called Temu for under $100. I managed to stay within budget, spending a total of $99.77. To complete this article, I needed to find items on the Temu site, add their prices to a spreadsheet, and adjust the selection until I reached my desired total budget.

The challenge I faced was converting the Temu links into a usable format. This is where ChatGPT proved to be incredibly useful.

Phase 1: Gathering the links
To begin, I collected all the links from the Temu site. I copied each link and pasted it into a Notion page. Notion allows you to create bookmark blocks that not only contain the links but also provide product names. To make it easier, I copied all the blocks and pasted them into a text editor. The resulting page may have looked messy, but it contained the necessary information.

Phase 2: Identifying the data
Each block of data contained three key elements. The product name was shown in gold text, surrounded by braces. The base URL of the product was in green text, surrounded by parentheses. There was also a question mark separating the main URL from additional tracking data. I only needed the main URL, so I ignored the rest.

Phase 3: Teaching ChatGPT to recognize the data
I introduced ChatGPT to the data by providing a prompt that instructed it to accept the data and await further instructions. I then copied and pasted all the information from the text editor into ChatGPT. At this point, ChatGPT knew to expect more details.

The next step was crucial. I wanted ChatGPT to extract the titles and links while disregarding the rest of the information. I provided a prompt that explained the desired outcome. This allowed me to name the data and test ChatGPT's understanding of the task.

ChatGPT successfully completed the assignment but stopped about two-thirds of the way through due to buffer limitations. I prompted it to continue, and it provided the remaining data. This process would have been time-consuming if done manually, but ChatGPT completed it in under a minute.

Phase 4: Cleaning up Temu's titles
Temu's product titles were overly complex for my project, so I needed to simplify them. Instead of lengthy titles like ""10 Inch LCD Writing Tablet, Electronis Memo With Leather Protective Case, Electronic Drawing Board For Digital Handwriting Pad Doodle Board, Gifts For,"" I wanted something more concise, such as ""LCD writing tablet with case."" I assigned this task to ChatGPT, reminding it that it had already parsed and identified the data. This reminder helped ChatGPT more effectively incorporate the previous steps.

By leveraging ChatGPT's capabilities, I was able to save valuable time and effort in gathering and organizing the information I needed for my project. Its efficiency and accuracy were impressive, and it proved to be an invaluable workhorse tool.

Remember, while my specific project may not align with yours, there are countless ways you can utilize ChatGPT to enhance your own projects. Its adaptability and versatility make it a valuable asset in various fields and industries.

In conclusion, generative AI tools like ChatGPT are more than just hype. They are practical tools that can significantly boost productivity and streamline complex tasks. Whether you're a content creator, researcher, or professional in any field, exploring the potential of AI tools like ChatGPT can revolutionize the way you work.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/70d8814af33b190ff84b8faa5f9bafe13d3586e2/2024/03/25/7d1cb1ff-3bb7-4972-a6cd-33d04da76bc1/cover.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/techcrunch-mobility-the-wheels-are-starting-to-come-off-the-fisker-ev-bus/,TechCrunch Mobility: The wheels are starting to come off the Fisker EV bus,"TechCrunch Mobility is a weekly newsletter that covers news and insights on the future of transportation. In this edition, we discuss the recent proposed standards released by the Biden Administration, Uber's first investment in an Africa-founded startup, Apple's antitrust suit extending to cars, and DoorDash's partnership with Wing for drone delivery. 

The Biden Administration has introduced two new proposed standards through the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency. These standards will have an impact on U.S. automakers and consumers. While the regulations have been softened to accommodate the automotive industry, they still impose stricter standards compared to previous ones. The DOE has introduced a ""petroleum equivalency factor"" that gives electric vehicles (EVs) a score under the corporate average fuel economy standards. The original proposal would have resulted in significant fines for automakers. On the other hand, the EPA has released tailpipe standards for 2027 to 2032 model year vehicles, which will impose more stringent requirements on automakers. However, they allow flexibility in meeting the rules through various powertrains. The original proposal would have required EVs to make up 67% of the U.S. passenger vehicle market by 2032. This has significant implications for legacy automakers, who are investing in EVs while still profiting from internal combustion engine vehicles.

EV startups like Rivian, Tesla, and Lucid are not significantly affected by these standards as they already meet the clean car standards. However, legacy automakers may face challenges as they invest in EVs while still relying on internal combustion engine vehicles. Plug-in hybrids may benefit from these regulations.

In other news, Moove, an African mobility fintech, raised $100 million in a Series B funding round led by Uber. Moove offers vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers and aligns with Uber's commitment to a fully zero-emission fleet. This investment marks Uber's first in an Africa-founded startup. Additionally, Candela, an electric boat maker, raised $25 million in a funding round led by Groupe Beneteau.

Overall, these developments in the transportation industry highlight the ongoing shift towards electric vehicles and the efforts of companies to adapt to new regulations and sustainability goals. Stay tuned for more updates on the future of transportation.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-deep-geothermal-renewable-powerhouse.html,Dig deep: US bets on geothermal to become renewable powerhouse,"Geothermal energy, despite currently representing a small fraction of US energy production, is gaining attention as a potential cornerstone of the green transition. Both businesses and President Joe Biden's administration are betting on technological advances to make geothermal energy a clean, reliable, and scalable power source. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm believes that geothermal energy has the potential to surpass hydroelectric and solar power in the US by 2050.

Geothermal energy harnesses the naturally high temperatures underground to generate electricity and heat buildings. However, it only accounted for 1.6 percent of US energy consumption in 2022. To increase production, the US government has invested over $200 million in an experimental site in Utah. This site focuses on Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), a technology that involves injecting water into very hot rocks deep underground, eliminating the need for nearby hot springs or reservoirs.

Francesco d'Avack, an analyst with S&P Global Commodity Insights, highlights the advantage of EGS being able to make geothermal energy viable in any location. Additionally, EGS reduces the upfront risk associated with drilling and finding nothing, which has deterred some investors in the past. Granholm also emphasizes that the US government is streamlining the conversion of permits for oil or gas exploration into geothermal licenses, reducing paperwork and delays.

Compared to classic fracking, EGS uses fewer chemical additives and does not release hydrocarbons. Geothermal energy also provides a steady flow of energy regardless of weather or time of day, unlike solar or wind power. The US government estimates that the cost of geothermal energy will decrease from the current range of $70 to $100 per megawatt hour (MWh) to $45 by 2035. Existing drilling technology makes geothermal energy development quicker and more cost-effective.

The US has been at the forefront of geothermal technology, but other countries, such as France, have also experimented with EGS. However, there is a possible risk of seismic activity associated with geothermal drilling projects, similar to fracking. The US Energy Department has implemented a mitigation protocol to address induced seismicity and is funding research on the issue. To ensure safety, no community has reported feeling seismicity near a DOE-funded project.

In the emerging geothermal market, several US and Canadian start-ups have raised significant investments. Fervo Energy, for example, collaborated with Google to connect its Nevada site to the electric grid. Demand for geothermal energy is also increasing, with companies like Google, Microsoft, and Nucor jointly purchasing geothermal energy. This willingness to pay a premium for geothermal energy excites the private sector and encourages further growth in the industry.

Despite the potential of geothermal energy, the sector is still small. The key to its growth lies in establishing the first successful commercial facility. Once one company demonstrates its viability, others will likely follow suit. It is crucial to approach the growth of the geothermal energy sector carefully and responsibly to ensure its long-term success.

In conclusion, geothermal energy is gaining momentum as a clean and reliable power source in the US. Technological advancements, such as Enhanced Geothermal Systems, show promise in expanding geothermal energy production. The US government's investments and streamlined licensing processes are driving the growth of the geothermal industry. With increased demand from major companies and rising investments in start-ups, geothermal energy has the potential to become a significant player in the green transition. However, careful development and adherence to safety protocols are crucial to ensure the long-term success of the geothermal energy sector.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/a-worker-operates-a-dr.jpg,2024-03-25 04:59:03,Innovation,Innovation

Cybercrime is not just a plotline in Hollywood movies; it is a real and increasing threat that targets individuals of all ages. So, buckle up as we navigate the seven seas of cyber safety.

Before we dive into the tips for staying safe online, let's arm ourselves with the ultimate weapon: knowledge. Scams are like snake oil salespeople in the digital world, peddling miracle cures. They come in various forms, hiding in the darkest corners of the internet. The golden rule of scam detection is skepticism.

Now, let's take a tour through the common terrain of cyber scams:

1. Phishing scams: Ah, phishing scams, the bane of our digital existence. These sneaky scams involve fake emails pretending to be from familiar faces or reputable companies. They try to trick you into clicking on suspicious links or sharing sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card details. Remember, real companies never ask for personal data via email.

2. Sweepstakes and awards scams: Congratulations! You've won a brand new car, a tropical vacation, and a lifetime supply of unicorn-shaped cookies. All you need to do is pay a small processing fee. Sound too good to be true? That's because it is! These scams promise instant wealth but are clever ruses to empty your wallet faster than you can say ""jackpot.""

3. Investment scams: Imagine a golden opportunity to double your money with zero risk. Investment scams lure unsuspecting victims with the promise of sky-high profits. Don't let these offers cloud your judgment. Always do your due diligence before investing your hard-earned cash.

4. Lawsuit or tax scams: Lawsuit and tax scams thrive on instilling fear and panic, claiming that you owe urgent payments. When in doubt, verify the legitimacy of any claims before reaching for your wallet.

5. Romance scams: Romance scams prey on the trusting hearts of hopeful romantics, weaving elaborate tales of love and devotion before swooping in for the financial kill. Remember, anyone who asks for money online is more likely to break your heart than mend it.

6. Tech support scams: These imposters offer remote assistance to fix nonexistent problems with your devices while gaining access to your sensitive data. Legitimate tech support doesn't come knocking unsolicited. If in doubt, delete the email and seek help from trusted sources.

Armed with this knowledge, you're ready to navigate the digital minefield with confidence. You can also be a good internet citizen by forwarding these scams to the U.S. government's Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) at phishing-report@us-cert.gov.

Now, let's move on to the seven tips for staying safe online:

1. Use strong passwords: Your password is the digital key to your castle, so don't make it something as flimsy as '123456' or 'password.' Get creative! Mix uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters like a mad scientist concocting a secret potion. And never reuse passwords across multiple accounts unless you want to throw a welcome party for cybercriminals.

2. Enable two-factor authentication: Add an extra layer of security to your accounts by enabling two-factor authentication. This means you'll need to provide a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password. It may seem like a hassle, but it significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.

3. Keep your software up to date: Software updates often contain important security patches that fix vulnerabilities. Don't ignore those annoying update notifications. Keeping your operating system, antivirus software, and other applications up to date is crucial for staying one step ahead of cyber threats.

4. Be cautious with public Wi-Fi: Public Wi-Fi networks can be a playground for cybercriminals. Avoid accessing sensitive information, such as banking or personal accounts, while connected to public Wi-Fi. If you must use it, consider using a virtual private network (VPN) for added security.

5. Think before you click: Clicking on suspicious links or downloading attachments from unknown sources is like opening Pandora's box. It can unleash malware or viruses onto your device. Be vigilant and think twice before clicking on anything that seems suspicious, even if it comes from a seemingly trustworthy source.

6. Be mindful of what you share: The internet is a vast and public space, so be mindful of what you share. Avoid posting personal information, such as your address or phone number, on public platforms. Also, be cautious about sharing too much personal information with strangers online.

7. Educate yourself and others: Knowledge is power. Stay informed about the latest cyber threats and scams. Share your knowledge with friends and family, especially those who may be more vulnerable to cyber attacks, such as older adults or children. By educating others, you contribute to a safer online community.

In conclusion, the digital world may be a wild west filled with cyber scammers, but with the right knowledge and precautions, you can navigate it safely. Remember to stay skeptical, use strong passwords, enable two-factor authentication, keep your software up to date, be cautious with public Wi-Fi, think before you click, be mindful of what you share, and educate yourself and others. By following these tips, you'll be well-equipped to protect yourself from cyber threats and enjoy the digital world with peace of mind.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ea0ea426a7cb96ff0f5cde/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 11:48:40,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/dma-first-formal-probes/,"Apple, Google and Meta face first formal investigations under EU's DMA","The European Union has recently launched a series of investigations on Big Tech companies, and it seems they have plenty to dig into. Alphabet/Google, Apple, and Meta (formerly Facebook) are the focus of the first formal non-compliance investigations under the Digital Markets Act (DMA). These investigations will examine various aspects of the companies' operations and determine whether they are violating the rules set forth in the DMA.

For Alphabet/Google, the EU is particularly interested in their rules regarding steering in Google Play and their approach to self-preferencing in search results. The EU will also be looking at Apple's rules on steering in the App Store and the design of choice screens for alternatives to its Safari web browser. Lastly, Meta's ""pay or consent"" model will be under scrutiny by the Commission.

In total, five investigations were announced on Monday, less than three weeks after the compliance deadline for the companies. These investigations are crucial in determining whether the companies are breaching the DMA rulebook, and if violations are confirmed, they could face fines of up to 10% of their global annual turnover.

The EU has up to 12 months to conclude these investigations, with a preliminary report expected within six months. However, the duration of the investigations may vary, according to senior Commission officials.

These investigations by the European Union come at a time when antitrust scrutiny on these three U.S. tech giants is also increasing in their home country. The companies' proposals for DMA compliance have faced criticism for not fully complying with the new EU law.

Google has been accused of trying to bypass the regulation's ban on self-preferencing by introducing new rich features in search results that unfairly compete with rivals. Apple's use of notifications to warn users of risks outside its ecosystem has also received negative feedback from developers, who refer to them as ""scare screens."" Meta's ""pay or be tracked"" tactic has been heavily criticized by privacy and consumer rights groups.

The European Commission specifically mentioned Article 5(4) of the DMA, which requires gatekeepers to allow app developers to ""steer"" consumers to offers outside their app stores free of charge. The Commission expressed concerns that Alphabet and Apple's steering measures may not be fully compliant as they impose various restrictions and limitations, hindering developers' ability to communicate and promote offers freely.

Regarding Google's self-preferencing, the investigation will focus on Google's vertical search services and their potential impact on similar rival services. The Commission is concerned that the measures implemented by Alphabet to comply with the DMA may not ensure fair treatment of third-party services compared to Alphabet's own services.

In the case of Apple, the EU will examine whether the company is fulfilling its user choice obligations on iOS. This includes enabling users to easily uninstall apps, change default settings, and prompt them with choice screens that allow them to select alternative default services, such as browsers or search engines on their iPhones. The Commission is concerned that Apple's measures, including the design of the web browser choice screen, may prevent users from truly exercising their choice of services within the Apple ecosystem.

As for Meta, the proceedings will investigate whether their ""pay or consent"" model for EU users complies with Article 5(2) of the DMA. This portion of the regulation requires gatekeepers to obtain user consent when combining or cross-using their personal data across different core platform services. The Commission is concerned that Meta's binary choice may not provide a real alternative if users do not consent, thus failing to achieve the objective of preventing the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers.

During a press conference, Thierry Breton, the EU's internal market commissioner, emphasized that the DMA clearly requires gatekeepers to offer a free, non-preferential choice to users. The investigations will determine whether the companies are meeting these requirements.

These investigations mark a significant step in the EU's efforts to regulate Big Tech and ensure fair competition in the digital market. The outcomes of these probes will have far-reaching implications for the future of these companies and their operations within the European Union.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1031626648.jpg?resize=1200,799",2024-03-25 12:10:10,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/spotify-courses-learning/,Spotify tests video courses to teach everything from music production to Excel,"Spotify, known primarily for its music streaming service, is venturing into the world of e-learning. In an effort to keep users engaged and encourage them to spend more time on its platform, Spotify is testing an online education offering in the UK. The content consists of freemium video courses produced in partnership with third parties such as the BBC and Skillshare. While at least two lessons will be free, the cost of a full course will range from £20 to £80 on average. For now, the prices will be the same for both basic and premium users.

Mohit Jitani, the product director for Spotify's education business, stated that pricing choices are being tested to assess demand and make the offering more compelling and exciting. The courses will be available on both Spotify's website and mobile app, accessible through the home and browse tabs under ""Courses."" The content covers a wide range of topics, from music production to learning Excel, and even includes lessons on how to create online learning lessons.

While there are numerous online learning sites available, Spotify's educational push focuses on one-directional, on-demand video content. Some courses may have supplementary material, but it will mainly consist of extra documents rather than tests or other interactive elements. Jitani did not comment on whether Spotify plans to introduce interaction or gamification in the future.

Spotify has partnered with Skillshare, PLAYvirtuoso, BBC Maestro, and Thinkific for its Courses feature. The company intends to curate the courses it offers based on users' listening and search habits. Third-party publishers own the videos and license them to Spotify, which will host and sell them on its platform. Revenue from sales will be shared among the creator, publisher, and Spotify, with content partners responsible for paying creators.

Spotify's move into education aligns with its strategy to diversify its business and improve profitability. The UK was chosen as the testing ground due to its large market size and high user engagement. While Spotify has faced financial challenges in recent years, the company sees potential in the overlap between popular podcasts and education content. Approximately half of Spotify Premium subscribers have listened to education or self-help podcasts, allowing Spotify to cross-promote courses through its recommendation system.

Overall, Spotify's foray into e-learning demonstrates its commitment to providing engaging and diverse content to its users. By leveraging its existing podcasting business and user data, Spotify aims to create a mutually beneficial ecosystem where podcasts and courses can complement each other.

The Thiel Fellowship, established by billionaire Peter Thiel, offers $100,000 to individuals who choose to forgo college and instead start their own companies. Meneses, who hails from the northeastern state of Sergipe, left his undergraduate studies at Stanford University to pursue this unique opportunity.

Meneses, now 23 years old, has been selected to join the Thiel Fellowship's 2024 cohort. He expressed his excitement, stating that it is a truly exceptional opportunity for him. In 2022, Meneses co-founded Hyperplane with Felipe Lamounier, Daniel Silva, and Rohan Ramanath. Hyperplane is a data intelligence firm that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to assist banks in utilizing their data to enhance their customer experience through hyper-personalization.

Although based in Silicon Valley, Meneses's company originated in Brazil and has secured contracts with 12 of the country's major financial institutions. Hyperplane has already received 30 million reais ($6 million) in investments from various backers, including Lachy Groom, SV Angel, Clocktower Technology Ventures, Liquid2 Ventures, Soma Capital, Latitud, Atman Capital, Crestone VC, and Norte. Additionally, Hyperplane has been chosen to participate in Endeavor's Scale-UP acceleration program in the first half of 2024.

Meneses's achievement is particularly noteworthy as he is the sole Latin American founder to join the Thiel Fellowship in 2024. Furthermore, in the previous year, no entrepreneurs from the region were included in the fellowship. However, Latin names did appear on the 2022 list of Thiel Fellows. Among the entrepreneurs selected that year was Ian Lee, the founder of Examedi, a healthtech company based in Chile. Examedi enables patients to access healthcare by connecting them with available healthcare providers. Another Latin founder from the 2022 cohort is Tamara Chaya Romo, a Mexican entrepreneur leading MEDU. MEDU specializes in developing reusable personal protective equipment.

The Thiel Fellowship continues to attract and support remarkable individuals from around the world, providing them with the resources and opportunities to pursue their entrepreneurial dreams. With Felipe Meneses becoming the first Latin Thiel Fellow, it is evident that the program's reach and impact are expanding, creating a global network of innovative thinkers and doers.

In conclusion, Felipe Meneses's selection as a Thiel Fellow is a testament to his talent and potential as a tech entrepreneur. His co-founding of Hyperplane and its success in the field of data intelligence demonstrate his ability to create innovative solutions. As the only Latin American founder in the 2024 Thiel Fellowship cohort, Meneses is breaking barriers and paving the way for future entrepreneurs from the region. This achievement showcases the increasing diversity and global influence of the Thiel Fellowship program.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66019447ce2364c0c92ae041/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 11:13:47,Innovation,Innovation
