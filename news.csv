This event is perfect for Gen AI enterprise leaders looking to gain insights and engage in conversations surrounding this important topic. Request an invite now to secure your spot.

In the world of venture capital, it's crucial to remember that it's about venture money, not adventure money. This was a witty response from a VC to a friend who was pitching an idea. However, when it comes to new technologies in the hype cycle phase, caution often goes out the window. VCs have a responsibility to invest the capital they raise, and missing out on something big is riskier than taking a swing and potentially missing, especially when everyone else is doing the same.

The same mindset can be found within most companies, particularly when it comes to AI and anything related to it. Large language models (LLMs), machine learning (ML), and any project labeled as AI suddenly become the center of attention and receive a lot of funding. However, billions of dollars will be wasted on AI in the next decade. This may sound contrary, but it's a reality of every big technology wave. Excitement builds before we fully understand the true impact and transformative potential. Search, social media, and mobile have all made a lasting impact, but virtual reality (VR) and crypto have fallen short of their initial hype.

Five years ago, headlines were full of AI promises and predictions. Today, everyone is rushing to showcase their AI investments and how it will revolutionize everything. However, this shotgun approach to investing often results in a few successful ventures and many failures. The pressure to invest in AI leads companies to greenlight projects that are optimistic at best, and often misguided adventures.

Despite the risk of wasted investments, LLMs are undeniably a game-changing technology. For example, ChatGPT reached 100 million users at an impressive speed compared to other transformative companies. Almost every enterprise company is utilizing LLMs and AI in some way. So, how do you determine where to place your bets and where you have the potential to succeed?

To make informed decisions and avoid wasted spend, consider these three key factors:

1. Understand the total cost over time: Before saying yes to an AI project, thoroughly evaluate the cost of the necessary resources both now and in the future to sustain the project. Often, 10 hours of work from a data science team require five times that amount of engineering, DevOps, QA, product, and SysOps time. Many companies have fragments of projects that were once promising but lacked ongoing investment to sustain them. Saying no to an AI initiative may be difficult today, but frequently saying yes can come at the expense of fully funding future endeavors that are truly worthwhile. Additionally, consider the increasing marginal cost that AI brings. Large models are expensive to train, run, and maintain. Overusing AI without a corresponding increase in downstream value can eat into your margins. Furthermore, retracting released or promised functionality can lead to customer dissatisfaction and damage your reputation, especially during a hype cycle.

2. Ask why no one else can do it: Don't forget the lessons of commoditization. In the tech industry, there are monopolies and commodities. When considering an AI initiative, ask yourself, ""Why us?"" If you're working on something that will eventually become a commodity, it won't be enjoyable, especially if you lack the scale and cost advantage. Nvidia and AWS/Azure are the ones who will definitely benefit from commoditization. To avoid this, focus on areas where you have a defensive moat. This could be preferential access to data, proprietary insights related to a specific use case, or an application with strong network effects where you have a head start.

3. Make a few bets you're willing to follow through: Sometimes, the best bets are the ones that enhance your existing business. As the old BASF commercial says, ""We don't make the things you buy, we make the things you buy better."" If applying AI can bring momentum to your products or services, it's a smart move. Additionally, consider making bets that align with your core competencies and where you have expertise. This way, you'll be more likely to see them through to success.

In conclusion, AI is a powerful technology with the potential to transform businesses. However, it's important to approach it with a clear understanding of the costs involved, the uniqueness of your position, and the bets you're willing to make. By considering these factors, you can avoid wasted spend and make strategic decisions that will lead to meaningful outcomes.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have surprising similarities in their growth trajectories. Both companies stumbled upon their core businesses by accident. AWS realized it could sell its internal services to other businesses, while Nvidia discovered that its gaming GPUs were well-suited for processing AI workloads. This led to explosive revenue growth for both companies.

Nvidia's revenue has been growing at triple digits, reaching $22.1 billion in Q4 2024 from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024. However, most of this growth came from the company's data center business. On the other hand, AWS has consistently been a major revenue driver for Amazon, although its growth has started to slow down. Microsoft and Google have also entered the market, creating the Big Three cloud vendors. It is expected that other chip makers will gain market share in the future.

Both Nvidia and AWS were in the right place at the right time. As web apps and mobile emerged, the cloud provided on-demand resources, and enterprises saw the value of moving workloads to the cloud. Similarly, the rise of AI and large language models coincided with the increased use of GPUs for processing these workloads.

While AWS has become a tremendously profitable business, Nvidia's growth rate is surpassing it. However, Nvidia needs to sustain this growth to become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS. If the GPU market tightens, Nvidia does have other businesses, but they generate smaller revenues and grow more slowly than the GPU data center business.

In the short term, both Nvidia and Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia's revenue growth to continue. The company anticipates $24 billion worth of revenue in its current quarter, a growth of around 234% compared to the year-ago first quarter. However, analysts expect Nvidia's growth rate to decline in the future.

Despite potential competition from AMD, Intel, and other chipmakers, AI could continue to drive growth for Nvidia in the coming years. Nvidia currently dominates the market, but competition is increasing. However, the company is well-positioned to withstand competition due to its market control.

In conclusion, Nvidia and AWS have experienced remarkable growth due to their accidental discoveries in their respective markets. While AWS has become a highly successful and profitable business, Nvidia's growth rate is surpassing it. With the continued rise of AI and competition from other chipmakers, the future looks promising for Nvidia, but sustaining growth in the long term remains a challenge.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/24/samsung-s24-ultra-s23-free-update-warning-for-galaxy-android-users/,Samsung Issues Critical Update For Millions Of Galaxy Users,"Attention Samsung Galaxy users! If you haven't already heard, there's a critical update that you need to check for and install as soon as possible. Trust me, you don't want to miss out on this one. Plus, there's another exciting change coming your way that will revolutionize your device. Let's dive into the details.

Samsung has been rolling out its March security update, and it's not just for the premium devices. Even the budget models are now getting their turn to shine. For example, the carrier-unlocked S21 FE devices in the US recently joined the update club. Over the past couple of weeks, various versions of S24s, S23s, and S22s received the update before the older and budget variants. It's crucial that you ensure your device downloads and installs this new software as soon as it becomes available for your specific network and model.

To find out if your device is eligible to receive the monthly update, you can check here. It's always good to stay informed and keep your device up to date to enjoy the latest features and security improvements.

Now, let's talk about the most exciting news of the week. Samsung has finally caught up with Google's seamless update system. In the past, updating your device meant going through the download, install, and reboot cycle. But now, with the new system, the update is downloaded and installed in the background to a secondary partition on your device. The next time you restart your device, it boots from that partition, making it the primary one. This way, the device downtime is minimized, and you can continue using your device normally while most of the updating process happens behind the scenes.

Google explains that this A/B system update, also known as seamless update, ensures that a functional booting system remains on the disk during an over-the-air update. This reduces the chances of having an inactive device after an update, leading to fewer device replacements and repairs. You can easily tell if a seamless update is being installed by looking at the two progress bars—one for the download/install process and the other for verification. The Galaxy A55 has been the first device to test this new update method, but we can expect it to roll out to more devices in the coming months. So, keep an eye out for updates on this exciting development.

Now, you might be wondering why Samsung took so long to adopt this seamless update system. Well, it seems like external factors may have played a role. Recent comments from the Android Open Source Project hinted that the legacy alternative to seamless updates would be removed after eight years of parallel running. Considering that seamless updates have been available since 2016, Samsung's delay has been quite remarkable. However, we can assume that there were discussions behind the scenes between Samsung and the Android project. After all, Samsung's contribution to the Android ecosystem is significant, and their collaboration is crucial for the success of the platform. As for what the future holds, we'll have to wait and see.

While this new update method may shorten the update process to just a minute or two of reboot time, it doesn't necessarily mean that the Samsung/Android update combination will become any less complex. Each month, the updates still need to be deployed across the wide range of Samsung devices, creating a patchwork quilt of updates. However, what it does eliminate is the need for user action. Updates will now happen automatically in the background, without requiring any input from you. Google suggests scheduling updates during idle maintenance mode, such as overnight and on Wi-Fi, to minimize disruption to your device usage.

Although Samsung's update process is still a far cry from Apple's seamless one-stop-shop approach, we can hope that it brings us a step closer. As the worlds of iPhone and Android continue to merge and evolve, who knows what the future holds? One thing's for sure: technology is always advancing, and we're excited to see what's in store for Samsung Galaxy users.

So, don't forget to check for that critical update and keep an eye out for the exciting changes coming your way. Stay tuned for more updates and make the most of your Samsung Galaxy device.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65b9d23fb7b46f6467a28780/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2366,1280,x313,y135,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 22:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/techcrunch-mobility-the-wheels-are-starting-to-come-off-the-fisker-ev-bus/,TechCrunch Mobility: The wheels are starting to come off the Fisker EV bus,"TechCrunch Mobility is a weekly newsletter that provides news and insights on the future of transportation. In this edition, we'll be discussing recent developments in the automotive industry, including proposed regulations by the Biden Administration, the impact on EV startups, and other interesting news in the field.

Firstly, let's address the proposed standards released by the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency that will affect U.S. automakers. These regulations, although softened to accommodate the automotive industry, car dealers, and unions, still impose stricter standards than before. The DOE's ""petroleum equivalency factor"" assigns a score to electric vehicles (EVs) under the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. The original proposal would have made it challenging for automakers to meet these standards, resulting in hefty fines. The EPA's tailpipe standards for 2027 to 2032 model year vehicles also impose stiffer requirements on automakers. However, they provide flexibility by allowing various powertrains to meet the rules. This means that automakers are not required to shift their entire fleet to battery electric vehicles (EVs). The original proposal, which demanded that EV sales reach 67% of the U.S. passenger vehicle market by 2032, was far more stringent. While these regulations may not have a significant impact on EV startups like Rivian, Tesla, and Lucid, they do affect legacy automakers who are investing in both EVs and internal combustion engine vehicles. Plug-in hybrids may emerge as winners in this scenario.

Moving on to some other news, Rivian has recently partnered with Tesla, which is an interesting development in the EV industry. Additionally, there is a startup called Candela that focuses on electric boats. They have raised $25 million in funding, with participation from Groupe Beneteau, EQT Ventures, Ocean Zero LLC, and Kan Dela AB. This shows that the electric mobility sector is expanding beyond just cars.

Now, let's discuss a startup called Clevon. Last month, there were rumors that the company was struggling to secure new investments and might shut down. However, the co-founder and CEO, Sander Sebastian Agur, has confirmed that the company is still operational and is in the process of merging with an American electric vehicle company. While there have been some cost reductions and layoffs, the merger is expected to be completed by the first half of June.

In other news, Uber has made its first investment in an Africa-founded startup called Moove. Moove is a mobility fintech company that offers vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers. The company raised $100 million in a Series B funding round led by Uber, bringing its valuation to $750 million. This investment aligns with Uber's commitment to a fully zero-emission fleet by 2040.

Lastly, there's a Bay Area startup called Amber that recently launched an aftermarket Tesla extended warranty product. They raised $3.18 million in a seed round co-led by Era and Primer Sazze, with participation from Alcove Fund, Virta Ventures, Global Millennial Capital, and Root & Shoot Ventures.

That wraps up this edition of TechCrunch Mobility. Stay tuned for more news and updates on the future of transportation.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1363022906.jpg?resize=1200,730",2024-03-24 19:00:33,Innovation,Innovation

It's Monday, and that means it's time to get back to work and back to Wordling! But before we dive into today's puzzle, how about a quick recap of the weekend? The last week of March is here, and it seems like time is flying by. The weather, on the other hand, seems to have a mind of its own. Just when we thought spring was here to stay, we got hit with a surprise snowstorm. It may be cold and wintry, but there's no denying the beauty of a snowy landscape.

Now, let's get down to business. Today's Wordle is waiting for us, and we're ready to crack the code. As always, we have a hint and a clue to guide us on our quest for the answer. The hint tells us that today's Wordle is normally considered a proper noun. Interesting, isn't it? And the clue reveals that there is a double letter in the phrase. That should narrow things down for us.

Spoiler alert! If you want to figure it out on your own, skip the next section.

After some initial confusion, I finally made some progress. The first few guesses didn't get me very far, leaving me with a whopping 195 possible solutions. But then, a breakthrough! The word ""allay"" turned out to be a crucial clue. It informed me that there was more than one 'L' in the answer and narrowed down the options to just one word. It was a close call, but I ultimately settled on ""sally."" It's not just a name; it's also an old-fashioned term for a battle tactic.

And now, for the moment of truth. Did I score any points in today's Wordle? Unfortunately, it's another wash. No points for guessing in four or tying with the Wordle Bot. It's a big, fat zero for me.

But let's take a moment to appreciate the etymology of ""sally."" In this context, it means to rush forth or make a sudden attack from a defensive position. It can also refer to setting out on a journey or venture. The word has an interesting history, tracing back through Middle French and Latin roots. ""Sally"" ultimately comes from the Latin word ""salire,"" meaning ""to leap."" This sense of movement or leaping forth is reflected in related words like ""salient"" and ""assail.""
