https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) share many similarities in their growth trajectories. Both companies found success through unexpected avenues. AWS discovered that it could sell its internal services to external customers, while Nvidia realized that its gaming-focused GPU was well-suited for AI workloads. This led to explosive revenue growth, with Nvidia's revenue increasing from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024 to $22.1 billion in Q4 2024, primarily driven by its data center business.

Although AWS never experienced the same rapid growth, it consistently generated significant revenue for Amazon. Both companies benefited from being early market entrants, but as Microsoft and Google entered the cloud market, competition grew. Other chip makers are also expected to gain market share in the coming years, further increasing competition.

The timing was crucial for both companies. As web apps and mobile technologies emerged in the early 2010s, the demand for cloud resources grew. Enterprises saw the value of moving workloads to the cloud instead of maintaining their own data centers. Similarly, the rise of AI and large language models coincided with the increased use of GPUs for processing these workloads.

While AWS has become a highly profitable business, Nvidia's growth rate has surpassed it recently. However, as both companies continue to grow, they will face challenges. Nvidia will need to sustain its growth and become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS. If the GPU market tightens, Nvidia does have other businesses, but they are smaller revenue generators growing at a slower pace than the data center business.

In terms of short-term financial outlook, Nvidia's revenue growth has been extraordinary, and it is expected to continue. The company anticipates $24 billion in revenue for the current quarter, representing a 234% growth compared to the same quarter last year. However, the growth rate is expected to decline as the company's revenue ramps up. Analysts project a more modest 8.6% growth rate from the last quarter of fiscal 2024 to the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Despite this, Nvidia's growth rate remains impressive, especially when compared to the previous year.

Looking at the future, AI seems to be a source of continued growth for Nvidia, even with emerging competition from AMD, Intel, and other chipmakers. Like AWS, Nvidia may face increased competition, but it currently holds a significant portion of the market. In terms of market share at the chip level, Nvidia is firmly in control, according to IDC. However, at the board level, AMD is gaining ground, as shown by market share numbers from Jon Peddie Research (JPR).

In conclusion, Nvidia and AWS have experienced remarkable growth, driven by their ability to adapt to changing market demands. While AWS has become a highly successful company, Nvidia is poised to become a long-term revenue powerhouse. Both companies face challenges, but their strong market positions and continued growth potential make them key players in the industry. As AI continues to evolve, Nvidia's position in the market looks promising, despite the emergence of new competition.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/24/samsung-s24-ultra-s23-free-update-warning-for-galaxy-android-users/,Samsung Issues Critical Update For Millions Of Galaxy Users,"If you own a Samsung Galaxy device, there's an important update you need to be aware of. It's crucial that you check for this update and install it as soon as it becomes available. Trust me, you don't want to miss out on this!

Samsung has been rolling out its March security update, starting with premium devices and now including budget models. For example, carrier-unlocked S21 FE devices in the US recently received the update. Over the past couple of weeks, different variants of S24s, S23s, and S22s have also been updated, with older and budget models joining the list. It's absolutely critical that you ensure your device downloads and installs this new software as soon as it becomes available for your specific network and model.

To check if your device is eligible for the monthly update, you can visit the Samsung website and confirm it there. It's always a good idea to stay on top of these updates to keep your device secure and running smoothly.

Now, let's talk about the exciting news that Samsung has finally embraced Google's seamless update approach. After years of avoiding it, Samsung has decided to jump on board. Previously, whenever a new update was released, users had to go through the process of downloading, installing, and rebooting their devices. With the new system, the update is downloaded and installed in the background to a secondary partition on the device. The device then reboots from that partition when it restarts, making the update seamless and reducing downtime.

This means that you won't have to wait for a long time while your device is unusable during the update process. Google explains that this new approach ensures a workable booting system remains on the disk during an over-the-air update, reducing the likelihood of an inactive device after the update. It also means fewer device replacements and device reflashes at repair and warranty centers. This is a big step forward for Samsung and its users.

As you can see in the provided image, when a seamless update is being installed, you'll notice two progress bars—one for the download and installation and another for verification. The Galaxy A55 has been the test subject for Samsung's initial seamless update, but we can expect this feature to roll out to more devices in the coming months. We're eagerly waiting to see which devices will be next in line.

It's worth noting that Samsung updates have always been known for their complexity, often requiring users to consult checklists to understand what, when, and for how long. While the seamless update process will make the installation quicker, it won't simplify the overall Samsung/Android update combination each month. There are still many factors and variables to consider.

However, one positive aspect is that this new approach removes the need for user action. Updates will happen in the background, so you don't have to initiate them yourself. Google recommends scheduling updates when the device is in idle maintenance mode, such as overnight and on Wi-Fi, to avoid disrupting users. This is a step toward the convenience of Apple's update process, although there's still a long way to go before reaching that level of simplicity.

In conclusion, if you own a Samsung Galaxy device, make sure to stay updated with the latest software releases. The March security update is crucial for your device's security and performance. Additionally, the new seamless update approach from Samsung is an exciting development that will make the update process smoother and less disruptive. Keep an eye out for the update on your specific network and model, and remember to install it as soon as it becomes available. Your device will thank you!","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65b9d23fb7b46f6467a28780/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2366,1280,x313,y135,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 22:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2024/03/24/the-walking-dead-the-ones-who-live-episode-5-review---another-massively-disappointing-episode/,‘The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live’ Episode 5 Review - Another Massively Disappointing Episode,"The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live has had its ups and downs so far, but I can't help but express my concern. Last week's episode and the season premiere left me disappointed, while episode 2 was a standout. Episode 3 was average at best. With such a short season, every episode carries significant weight.

As we approach the second-to-last episode of the season, I was hoping for a return to form. Unfortunately, tonight's episode, titled ""Become,"" was filled with absurd coincidences and tired tropes that left me cold. It seems like the writers couldn't come up with anything better and resorted to convenient plot points.

Spoilers ahead.

The episode starts and ends with a surprise cameo from Gabriel. I was expecting a cameo, but I thought it would be Morgan, who had set out to find Rick when he left Fear The Walking Dead. Sadly, Fear ruined Morgan's character, and I hope we never see him again. It's a shame to see such a talented actor wasted season after season. Even on the main show, he was underutilized, with his random moments of insanity and the ""You know what it is!"" nonsense.

However, I did enjoy the flashback scenes with Gabriel and Jadis. They built suspense, especially when we discovered that she had killed someone close to her. I genuinely thought Gabriel would meet his demise. It would have been a bold move for the series, but it seems like they are playing it safe these days. Instead, Jadis is the one who meets her end, rambling about choosing sides and her personal transformation.

What didn't work for me in this episode was how implausible it all felt. Rick and Michonne are on the run and have managed to disappear. They stumble upon a group of survivors being attacked by ""stoners"" - zombies who have turned into stone walkers. At first, it seems like these walkers are hard to kill because their skin is rock-hard. However, Rick and Michonne dispatch them with ease.

Michonne, in a friendly gesture, offers them some ramen and then the survivors turn on them, holding them at gunpoint. Rick and Michonne don't even flinch. There is no tense showdown like we've seen before. Our heroes overpower their enemies, make them promise to change their ways, and even return their weapons. I found this decision baffling. It's one thing not to kill them, but giving them their guns back on a promise seems naive.

Predictably, all three of these survivors meet their demise by the end of the episode. It begs the question, how have these people survived for over a decade in the apocalypse when they lack basic survival skills? It's truly bewildering. By this point, I would expect anyone they encounter to possess the same level of skill and determination as Rick and Michonne. It's hard to believe that there are still survivors who are this clueless.

I half-expected Rick and Michonne to start kissing in the middle of the fight, as they seem to do whenever possible. It's become somewhat comical. They had very little romantic development in the main show, and now it's non-stop smooching.

But I suppose it's understandable. After everything they've been through, it's only natural that they would be drawn to each other. They were even lucky enough to find a fully-powered smart home last week, where they decided to have sex while the building was collapsing around them! This week, they stumble upon the Three Pines Cabin, a cozy retreat where they can relax and enjoy each other's company.

Of course, their peace doesn't last long. Jadis shows up the next morning, guns blazing, and that's where the episode ends.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600b341eca045b614f49ec5/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=800,450,x0,y41,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 21:39:14,Innovation,Innovation

Welcome back, Wordle enthusiasts! It's the start of a new work week, and we're ready to dive into another round of puzzling fun. But before we get started, let's take a moment to appreciate the strange weather we've been experiencing lately. Just when we thought spring was here, Mother Nature decided to surprise us with half a foot of snow. It may be cold, but there's no denying the beauty of a winter wonderland.

Now, let's shift our focus back to Wordle. Today's puzzle comes with a helpful hint: we usually associate this word as a proper noun. Additionally, there's a clue to keep in mind - there's a double letter involved in the solution. Intriguing, isn't it?

But before we reveal the answer, let's analyze our Wordle journey. Personally, I found today's puzzle quite perplexing. Initially, I had a whopping 195 possible solutions after my first attempt. Not the best start, I must admit. Even after trying the word ""Boink,"" my options only decreased to 40, leaving me feeling a bit lost.

However, a stroke of luck came my way when I guessed ""Allay."" This word informed me that there was more than one 'L' in the solution, narrowing down my choices significantly. After some brainstorming, I finally settled on ""Sally."" I know, it may sound like a name, but it also has a historical meaning - a battle tactic from a bygone era.

Now, let's talk about the competitive aspect of Wordle. Unfortunately, today wasn't my lucky day. I didn't score any points for guessing in four or tying with the Wordle Bot. It's a big, fat zero for me. But hey, that's all part of the fun, right?

Before we wrap up, let's delve into the etymology of the word ""sally"" in this context. When used as a non-proper noun, ""sally"" refers to a sudden rush or attack from a defensive position. It can also mean embarking on a journey or venturing into something new. The word's etymology is quite fascinating, tracing back through various languages.

In Middle French, ""sally"" originated from the verb ""sallir,"" meaning ""to rush out, leap forth."" This verb can be traced back even further to its Latin root, ""salire,"" meaning ""to leap."" This Latin root has given rise to other related words in English, such as ""salient"" (prominently projecting) and ""assail"" (to attack). All these words share the common thread of movement or leaping forth.

And that concludes today's Wordle adventure! Don't forget to check out my blog for daily Wordle and Strands guides, along with other exciting content like TV show recommendations, streaming guides, movie reviews, and video game coverage. There's something for everyone!

https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewwight/2024/03/24/helping-patients-access-sickle-cell-disease-treatments-in-west-africa/,Helping Patients Access Sickle Cell Disease Treatments In West Africa,"A researcher from Cameroon is on a mission to help patients in low-income countries in West Africa access affordable medicine for sickle cell disease. Dr. Marthe-Sandrine Eiymo Mwa Mpollo, a scientist and co-founder of NaYa Health, realized that having a drug for sickle cell disease is not enough if patients cannot afford it. With 80% of sickle cell disease cases occurring in sub-Saharan Africa and 89% of women in central and west Africa lacking access to universal medical coverage, there is a pressing need for a solution.

Inspired by the lack of access to medication, NaYa Health was founded as a digital patient assistance platform. Its goal is to help underserved patients, particularly those without insurance, to have timely access to medication even when they are short on cash. NaYa Health achieves this through community savings, deferred payments, and a portable health-only savings account that helps manage health risks and safeguard earnings.

In a pilot implementation in Cameroon's capital, NaYa Health has made a significant impact. It has boosted the ability of informal workers to handle unexpected challenges, increased income for local medical providers, and guaranteed access to critical services. The success of NaYa Health has been recognized, as it was selected in the financial inclusion challenge by MIT Solve.

Dr. Mpollo's passion for medicine in Cameroon stems from her childhood experiences. Growing up, she witnessed the impact of sickle cell disease on families and the limitations of healthcare in resource-constrained settings. This fueled her desire to bring effective healthcare to those in challenged communities. While her initial plan was to become a medical doctor, her journey led her to life science research in Canada and the US, where she obtained a doctorate in medicine, focusing on sickle cell disease.

After publishing scientific papers on the mechanism causing lung damage in sickle cell patients and communicating her research findings, Dr. Mpollo realized the importance of access to medication. She understood that research can only save lives if patients can actually benefit from it. This realization led to the launch of NaYa Health, with a mission to bridge the gap between research and access to medication.

Dr. Mpollo believes that scientists from the Global South have a unique perspective on healthcare limitations in their communities. Their lived experiences allow them to better understand the affordability, access, and cultural acceptance of research findings. By leveraging this perspective, scientists from the Global South can tailor their research to have a more impactful outcome for their communities. This approach also opens up the possibility of working with local actors to define or adapt scientific findings for distribution.

In another part of Africa, a team of entrepreneurs, researchers, and health professionals in Zambia are using artificial intelligence (AI) to improve care for pregnant women. Despite a decrease in the maternal death rate in Zambia, there is still a 1% risk of dying in pregnancy or childbirth for Zambian women. Dawa Health, based in Lusaka, has developed the DawaMom project, which harnesses AI tools, mobile clinics, and digital platforms to enhance maternal and child health.

The DawaMom project involves over 60 community health workers who provide in-community healthcare. Through the mobile platform, over 800 mothers are signed up to receive support and information. The project utilizes generative AI models that are patient-facing and respond to patient queries. This innovative use of AI enables pregnant women to access timely and accurate information, improving their overall health outcomes.

Both NaYa Health and the DawaMom project showcase the power of innovation and technology in addressing healthcare challenges in Africa. By leveraging digital platforms, community engagement, and AI tools, these initiatives are making a difference in the lives of underserved populations. They highlight the importance of affordability, accessibility, and tailored solutions in healthcare delivery.

In conclusion, Dr. Marthe-Sandrine Eiymo Mwa Mpollo's journey from being a medical scientist to a co-founder of NaYa Health reflects her commitment to addressing the healthcare needs of patients with sickle cell disease. NaYa Health's digital patient assistance platform provides a lifeline for underprivileged patients by ensuring access to affordable medication. Similarly, the DawaMom project in Zambia utilizes AI and digital tools to improve maternal and child health outcomes. These initiatives exemplify the transformative potential of technology and innovation in healthcare and serve as an inspiration for future endeavors.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66009a73668df974c31e0a4f/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=579,579,x127,y431,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 17:54:08,Innovation,Innovation
