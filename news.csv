With the anticipation building, let's take a moment to talk about the upcoming PlayStation Plus lineup for April. But before we dive into that, let's start with a brief overview of PlayStation Plus and its cost.

PlayStation Plus is Sony's monthly membership program that provides access to online gaming. It's important to note that it is not required for streaming movies or TV shows on platforms like Netflix or playing free-to-play games such as Warzone or Fortnite. However, if you want to play any paid online games, a subscription is necessary.

There are three tiers of PlayStation Plus: Essential, Extra, and Premium. For the purpose of this discussion, we'll focus on the free monthly games available with the Essential tier. After a recent price hike, the costs for each tier are as follows: PS Plus Essential at $79.99/year, PS Plus Extra at $134.99/year, and PS Plus Premium at $159.99/year.

Now, let's move on to the exciting part: the reveal of next month's PS Plus games. Sony typically announces the following month's games on the last Wednesday of the month, although this isn't always the case. The general rule is that the new lineup is released on the first Tuesday of the month, with the games being revealed the previous Wednesday.

With that in mind, we can expect an announcement for April's lineup on the morning of Wednesday, March 27th, and the new games will become available on Tuesday, April 2nd. As of now, there have been no leaks or rumors about the essential games for April. It's important to note that no games are scheduled for release on April 2nd, so we can safely assume that the lineup won't include any new releases.

While we await the official announcement, let's take a look at some predictions and wishful thinking for April's PlayStation Plus lineup. Please keep in mind that these predictions are based on personal speculation and hopes. It's also worth mentioning that we might see some Simulator or sports games added to the lineup.

Here are a few predictions and wishful thinking titles:

1. Assassin's Creed Valhalla
2. Need For Speed Unbound
3. The Outer Worlds
4. Forspoken
5. Demon's Souls
6. The Order 1886
7. The Last Of Us Part 1
8. LEGO Jurassic World
9. Marvel's Midnight Suns
10. Tales of Arise
11. Cult Of The Lamb
12. Little Nightmares 2

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/24/meet-the-apps-that-tell-you-when-to-take-your-eclipse-glasses-off/,Meet The Apps That Tell You When To Take Your Eclipse Glasses Off,"When it comes to knowing when to remove your solar eclipse glasses, it can be quite confusing. There are a few factors to consider in order to fully enjoy the experience. First, you need to make sure you are within the path of totality, which is a narrow strip about 115 miles wide. Secondly, you need to find a location with a clear sky. And finally, you need to know the exact moment to take off your glasses to witness the sun's magnificent corona.

For many people, it's this last step that causes panic and uncertainty. But the answer is actually quite simple. You remove your eclipse glasses when it gets dark. If you are in the path of totality, you will notice a sudden and significant darkness as the moon's shadow passes over you. It will be an unmistakable moment that you won't want to miss. On the other hand, if you are not in the path of totality, it will not get dark, so you should continue using your glasses.

However, there are now smartphone apps available that can enhance your eclipse viewing experience. These apps provide an immersive audio guide that not only tells you when to remove your glasses during totality but also guides you through other phenomena to look out for. For example, you can learn about shadow bands, which are wavy lines on the ground caused by Earth's turbulent atmosphere when the sun is a small crescent. You can also discover Baily's beads, which are the last few drops of sunlight, and witness the diamond ring effect, when the corona appears like a halo.

To fully enjoy these apps, it is recommended to use over-the-ear bone conduction earphones instead of earbuds to avoid blocking out the people around you. There are a few notable apps available:

1. The Eclipse Company: This app offers a ""Pro"" version that provides real-time weather updates, cloud forecasts for totality, a countdown timer with a vibration alert to safely remove your eclipse glasses, and detailed information about local eclipse events. It also alerts you to look out for eclipse phenomena to create an immersive audio experience during the eclipse.

2. Solar Eclipse Timer App: Developed by eclipse chaser and educator Gordon Telepun, this app determines your location and guides you through the contact times. It also provides information about eclipse phenomena. It is particularly useful for photographers, as it includes a ""Photographer's Mode"" developed with ex-NASA eclipse calculator and photographer Fred Espenak.

3. One Eclipse: This app, created by the non-profit organization Astronomers Without Borders and Simulation Curriculum, supports a recycling program for eclipse glasses in underserved communities worldwide. It allows you to simulate the eclipse from your location or anywhere on Earth. The app includes an interactive map with precise eclipse event times and a dynamic Eclipse Countdown clock with an audio timer for each phase of the eclipse.

In conclusion, knowing when to remove your solar eclipse glasses doesn't have to be a vexing question anymore. By following simple guidelines and utilizing smartphone apps, you can fully embrace the awe-inspiring experience of a solar eclipse. Just remember to stay safe and enjoy the beauty of the celestial event.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have had parallel growth trajectories, despite their different core businesses. Both companies stumbled upon opportunities that led to explosive revenue growth. AWS discovered it could sell its internal services to other businesses, while Nvidia realized that its gaming GPU was also well-suited for AI workloads.

Nvidia's revenue has been growing at an astonishing rate, from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024 to $22.1 billion in Q4 2024. However, most of this growth came from the company's data center business. On the other hand, AWS has consistently been a major revenue driver for Amazon, although its growth has started to slow down. As Microsoft and Google entered the market, the cloud industry became more competitive. Other chip makers are also expected to gain market share in the coming years.

Both Nvidia and AWS were in the right place at the right time. The rise of web apps and mobile technology coincided with the emergence of cloud computing, which provided on-demand resources for enterprises. Similarly, the growth of AI and large language models led to increased demand for GPUs to process these workloads.

While AWS has become a highly successful and profitable business, its growth has started to slow down. Nvidia, on the other hand, is experiencing rapid growth. The question is whether Nvidia can sustain this growth and become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS.

In the short term, Nvidia's revenue growth is expected to continue. The company anticipates $24 billion worth of revenue in its current quarter, a 234% increase compared to the same quarter last year. However, as the company's revenue ramps up, its growth rate is expected to decline. Analysts predict that Nvidia will generate $110.5 billion worth of revenue in its current fiscal year, an 81% increase from the previous year.

Despite the expected decline in growth rate, Nvidia is still projected to scale its revenue past the $100 billion annual run rate mark. The company has significant growth opportunities in the AI market, even as competition from AMD, Intel, and other chipmakers emerges. Nvidia currently dominates the market, but AMD is gaining ground at the board level.

In conclusion, both Nvidia and AWS have experienced remarkable growth due to their ability to adapt to market demands. While AWS has become a highly profitable business, Nvidia's revenue growth shows no signs of slowing down. The future looks promising for Nvidia, especially in the AI market, where it has a strong foothold.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation

Welcome back, Wordle enthusiasts! It's time to tackle another puzzle and put our word-guessing skills to the test. But before we dive in, let's take a moment to appreciate the quirkiness of the past weekend. Just when we were ready to embrace the sunny, blossoming spring, it decided to surprise us with half a foot of snow. It may be cold and wintry, but there's no denying the beauty of a snow-covered landscape.

Now, let's get down to business and solve today's Wordle! Here are the hints and clues you've been waiting for:

Hint: Normally, we think of this as a proper noun.
Clue: Today's Wordle has a double letter.

Alright, time for the answer. Brace yourselves!

Today's Wordle is a challenging one. I have to admit, it had me scratching my head for a while. The initial guesswork left me with a whopping 195 possible solutions. Not the best start, I must say. But hey, don't give up just yet!

Then, I stumbled upon the word ""allay,"" and it turned out to be a significant breakthrough. With the realization that there was more than one 'L' in the phrase, I narrowed down my options to just one word. Almost going for ""palsy,"" I suddenly had an epiphany and opted for ""sally"" instead. Sure, it's commonly known as a name, but it also refers to a battle tactic from the olden days.

Now, let's talk scores. Unfortunately, today wasn't my lucky day. No points for guessing in four or tying with the Wordle Bot. A big, fat zero it is. But hey, there's always tomorrow, right?

Wordle Etymology

Now, let's take a moment to explore the etymology of the word ""sally"" in this non-proper noun context. It's quite fascinating how words travel through time and various languages before finding their place in English.

The term ""sally"" traces its roots back to Middle French, where ""sallie"" served as the noun form of ""sallir,"" meaning ""to rush out, leap forth."" This Middle French word, in turn, has its origins in the Latin word ""salire,"" which translates to ""to leap."" The Latin root has given rise to several related English words, such as ""salient"" (prominently projecting) and ""assail"" (to attack). These words reflect the idea of movement or leaping forth.

So, when we use ""sally"" to describe a sudden attack from a defensive position or embarking on a journey or new venture, we're capturing the essence of moving out or leaping forth, often with an element of surprise or unexpectedness.

Conclusion

That wraps up today's Wordle adventure. I hope you enjoyed the challenge and learned something new about the word ""sally"" along the way.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewwight/2024/03/24/helping-patients-access-sickle-cell-disease-treatments-in-west-africa/,Helping Patients Access Sickle Cell Disease Treatments In West Africa,"A researcher from Cameroon is on a mission to help patients in low-income countries in West Africa afford the medicine they need for sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease affects over 4 million people worldwide, with about 80% of cases occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. Unfortunately, 89% of women in central and west Africa lack access to universal medical coverage.

Dr. Marthe-Sandrine Eiymo Mwa Mpollo, a scientist and co-founder of NaYa Health, discovered that having a drug for sickle cell disease is not enough for patients. Affordability plays a crucial role in accessing necessary medication. Inspired by this realization, she founded NaYa Health, a digital patient assistance platform aimed at helping underserved patients without insurance access medication through community savings, deferred payments, and a health-only savings account.

In a pilot implementation in Cameroon's capital, NaYa Health successfully provided informal workers with the ability to handle unexpected challenges, increased resilience among informally employed individuals, and ensured critical services were accessible. Their efforts were recognized when NaYa Health was selected in the financial inclusion challenge by MIT Solve.

Dr. Mpollo's passion for medicine in Cameroon can be traced back to her childhood. Growing up in Cameroon, she witnessed the impact of sickle cell disease on families and the financial burden it caused. This experience fueled her desire to bring healthcare to challenged communities. Although her initial goal was to become a medical doctor, her journey led her to life science research in Canada and the US, where she obtained a doctorate from the Faculty of Medicine of Cincinnati. Her research focused on developing therapies for sickle cell disease, a genetic disease that disproportionately affects individuals of African descent.

After publishing scientific papers on the mechanism causing lung damage in sickle cell patients and communicating her findings, Dr. Mpollo realized that access to medication was crucial for research to have a life-saving impact. This realization led to the launch of NaYa Health. She believes that scientists from the Global South have a unique perspective on the limitations of their settings, particularly when it comes to affordability, access, and cultural acceptance of research findings. By tailoring their research to be more impactful for their communities, scientists from the Global South can work with local actors to define or adapt distribution models for scientific findings.

In another part of Africa, a team of entrepreneurs, researchers, and health professionals in Zambia are utilizing artificial intelligence to improve care for pregnant women. Despite a decrease in Zambia's death rate for pregnant mothers, there is still a 1% risk of mortality during pregnancy or childbirth. Tafadzwa Kalisto Munzwa, founder and CEO of Dawa Health in Lusaka, Zambia, leads the DawaMom project, which leverages AI tools, last-mile health workers, mobile clinics, and digital platforms to enhance maternal and child health.

DawaMom has over 60 community health workers providing in-community healthcare and over 800 mothers signed up on the mobile platform. The project's generative AI models are patient-facing and respond to patient needs, ensuring personalized and efficient care.

These initiatives in Cameroon and Zambia demonstrate the power of innovative solutions in addressing healthcare challenges in low-income countries. Through platforms like NaYa Health and DawaMom, researchers, entrepreneurs, and health professionals are making a tangible difference in the lives of patients, improving access to medication and enhancing maternal and child health.

By prioritizing affordability, accessibility, and community engagement, these initiatives are paving the way for a brighter future in healthcare in Africa and beyond. The dedication and passion of individuals like Dr. Mpollo and Mr. Munzwa serve as inspiration for others to strive for innovative solutions that can transform healthcare delivery in resource-limited settings.

Together, we can work towards a world where healthcare is accessible to all, regardless of income or geographical location. Through collaboration, innovation, and a commitment to improving the lives of patients, we can make a lasting impact on global health.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66009a73668df974c31e0a4f/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=579,579,x127,y431,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 17:54:08,Innovation,Innovation
