https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-quantum-algorithm-high-quality-solutions.html,Novel quantum algorithm proposed for high-quality solutions to combinatorial optimization problems,"Quantum computers have the potential to revolutionize the way we solve complex problems in fields like logistics, supply chain management, machine learning, material design, and drug discovery. These computers leverage the quantum property of superposition to quickly find optimal solutions to combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). However, when COPs involve constraints, conventional quantum algorithms face challenges in obtaining near-optimal solutions within the operation time of quantum computers.

To tackle this issue, researchers from Waseda University in Japan have developed a groundbreaking post-processing variationally scheduled quantum algorithm (pVSQA). This algorithm combines variational scheduling with a post-processing method to transform infeasible solutions into feasible ones, enabling near-optimal solutions for constrained COPs on both quantum annealers and gate-based quantum computers.

The pVSQA algorithm works by first using a quantum device to generate a variational quantum state through quantum computation. This state then produces a probability distribution function that includes both feasible and infeasible solutions within the COP's constraints. The post-processing method is then employed to convert the infeasible solutions into feasible ones, resulting in a probability distribution containing only feasible solutions. A classical computer is utilized to calculate the energy expectation value of the cost function using this new probability distribution. By repeating this calculation, the algorithm achieves a near-optimal solution.

The researchers evaluated the performance of the pVSQA algorithm using both simulations and real quantum devices, such as a quantum annealer and a gate-type quantum device. The experiments demonstrated that pVSQA achieves near-optimal performance within a predetermined time on the simulator and outperforms conventional quantum algorithms without post-processing on real quantum devices.

This innovative algorithm has significant implications for addressing complex real-world problems across various domains. It opens up new possibilities for utilizing quantum computers to solve COPs and contributes to the advancement of long-term social transformations, such as achieving a carbon-neutral society and sustainable development goals.

In summary, the pVSQA algorithm developed by the researchers at Waseda University represents a significant breakthrough in leveraging quantum computers for solving COPs. Its ability to handle constraints and deliver near-optimal solutions has promising implications for addressing complex problems in diverse fields. With further development and refinement, this algorithm has the potential to drive transformative changes in society.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/novel-quantum-algorith.jpg,2024-03-25 12:50:38,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.zdnet.com/article/saving-hours-of-work-with-ai-how-chatgpt-became-my-virtual-assistant-for-a-data-project/,Saving hours of work with AI: How ChatGPT became my virtual assistant for a data project,"There has been a lot of buzz surrounding generative artificial intelligence (AI) lately, with tools like ChatGPT gaining attention. While these tools are indeed impressive, it's important to remember that they are just that - tools. They can be used to assist with various projects, much like other productivity software.

In this article, I'll share a project where ChatGPT saved me a significant amount of time and effort. Although this specific project may not be relevant to your needs, I hope it will inspire you to consider using ChatGPT as a valuable tool for your own projects. Let's dive in!

The Project: Exploring Temu's Affordable Computer Gear
In the coming month, I will be publishing what I like to call a ""stunt article."" These articles are fun projects that I create to captivate and engage readers. The article I'm currently working on involves exploring how much computer gear I can purchase from Temu for under $100. Spoiler alert: I managed to come in at $99.77!

To compile this article, I needed to scour the Temu website for affordable items to highlight. For instance, I discovered an iPad keyboard and mouse combo priced at around $6. However, to stay within my $100 budget, I had to meticulously organize the Temu links in a spreadsheet, record their prices, and rearrange items until I reached my desired total budget.

The Challenge: Converting Temu Links into Usable Data
Converting the Temu links into a usable format presented a significant challenge. This is where ChatGPT came to the rescue.

Phase 1: Gathering the Links
First, I gathered all the links by copying them from the Temu website and pasting them into a Notion page. Notion provides the option to create bookmark blocks, which not only include the links but also the product names.

Phase 2: Identifying the Data
Each data block consisted of three key elements. The product name was highlighted in gold and enclosed in braces. The base URL was displayed in green and enclosed in parentheses. Lastly, there was a question mark that separated the main page URL from the random tracking data. I only needed the main URL.

Phase 3: Teaching ChatGPT to Recognize the Data
To teach ChatGPT to recognize the data, I provided it with the prompt: ""Accept the following data and await further instructions."" Then, I copied all the information from the text editor and pasted it into ChatGPT. At this point, ChatGPT knew to expect more details.

The real work began in the next step. I wanted ChatGPT to extract the titles and links while disregarding the rest of the information. I gave it the following prompt to achieve this:

""The data above consists of a series of blocks of data. At the beginning of each block is a section within [] brackets. For each block, designate this as TITLE. Following the [] brackets is an open paren (followed by a web URL). For each block, extract that URL, but dispose of everything following the question mark, and also dispose of the question mark. Most URLs will then end in .html. We will designate this as URL. For each block, display the TITLE followed by a carriage return, followed by the URL, followed by two newlines.""

This prompt served two purposes. Firstly, it allowed me to assign names to the data for easier reference later on. Secondly, it served as a test to ensure ChatGPT understood the assignment.

ChatGPT successfully completed the assignment, although it did pause two-thirds of the way through due to buffer limitations. I instructed the bot to continue, and it provided me with the remaining data. The entire process took less than a minute, saving me significant time and effort compared to manual extraction.

Phase 4: Simplifying Temu's Complex Titles
Temu's product titles were overly complex for my project. Instead of using titles such as ""10 Inch LCD Writing Tablet, Electronis Memo With Leather Protective Case, Electronic Drawing Board For Digital Handwriting Pad Doodle Board, Gifts For,"" I wanted something more concise, like ""LCD writing tablet with case.""

I assigned this task to ChatGPT as well. I reminded the tool that it had previously parsed and identified the data. I find that reminding ChatGPT about a previous step helps it more reliably incorporate that knowledge.

By utilizing ChatGPT, I was able to streamline the process of converting Temu links into usable data and simplify the product titles for my article. This saved me valuable time and allowed me to focus on creating engaging content for my readers.

In conclusion, generative AI tools like ChatGPT can be incredibly useful in various projects. While they are not a replacement for human assistance, they serve as efficient workhorse tools that can save time and effort. Consider incorporating ChatGPT into your projects and witness the benefits firsthand!",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/70d8814af33b190ff84b8faa5f9bafe13d3586e2/2024/03/25/7d1cb1ff-3bb7-4972-a6cd-33d04da76bc1/cover.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/boeing-ceo-to-leave-company-by-year-end-after-a-wave-of-safety-incidents/,Boeing CEO to leave company by year-end after a wave of safety incidents,"Boeing, one of the world's largest airplane manufacturers, has announced that its CEO, Dave Calhoun, will be stepping down by the end of 2024. This decision comes in the wake of a series of safety incidents that have plagued the company in recent years.

One such incident involved a cabin panel blowout on one of Boeing's planes, which raised serious concerns about the safety and integrity of their aircraft. Additionally, there have been several other incidents that have further undermined public trust in the company.

To address these issues, Boeing has implemented an innovation acceleration program called Aerospace Xelerated, aimed at collaborating with startups in the aerospace industry. This program, formerly known as the Aerospace Technology Institute, has been instrumental in fostering a larger ecosystem of aerospace startups that work closely with Boeing. However, it remains unclear how Calhoun's departure will impact this program, and TechCrunch has reached out to Aerospace Xelerated for further clarification.

In a statement, Calhoun expressed his commitment to completing the necessary work to stabilize and position the company for the future. This suggests that he recognizes the importance of addressing the safety concerns and restoring faith in Boeing's products.

One incident that significantly impacted Boeing's reputation was the emergency landing of an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 jet in January. This incident led to the grounding of 171 Max 9 jets for several weeks. It was the largest safety crisis that Boeing had faced since the tragic crashes of two Max 8 jets in 2018 and 2019, which resulted in the loss of 346 lives.

As part of the company's efforts to address these issues, Stan Deal, who currently leads Boeing's commercial airplanes business, will also be leaving the company. Stephanie Pope has been appointed to take over this role. Pope has an impressive background, having previously served as the chief operating officer of Boeing and as the president and CEO of Boeing Global Services. Her experience and expertise will be invaluable in leading the company's aerospace services for commercial, government, and aviation industry customers worldwide.

It is important to note that this story is still developing, and more information is expected to emerge in the coming days. As such, it is crucial to stay updated on the latest developments regarding Boeing and its leadership transition.

In conclusion, Boeing's CEO, Dave Calhoun, will be leaving the company by the end of 2024. This decision follows a series of safety incidents that have raised concerns about the company's products. However, Boeing is taking steps to address these issues, including the implementation of an innovation acceleration program and the appointment of a new leader for its commercial airplanes business. The company remains committed to stabilizing and positioning itself for a successful future. As more information becomes available, it is important to stay informed about the latest developments in this evolving story.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1910140688.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-25 12:48:28,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/large-language-models-can-help-home-robots-recover-from-errors-without-human-help/,Large language models can help home robots recover from errors without human help,"Home robots have faced numerous challenges in achieving success beyond the popular Roomba vacuum cleaner. Factors such as pricing, practicality, form factor, and mapping have all contributed to the failure of many home robots. Even when these issues are addressed, there remains the question of how robots handle mistakes.

This is not only a problem at the consumer level but also in the industrial sector. While big companies have the resources to address problems as they arise, consumers cannot be expected to learn programming or hire someone every time an issue occurs. However, researchers from MIT have found a potential solution using large language models (LLMs) in robotics.

A study set to be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) in May aims to introduce some ""common sense"" into the process of correcting robot mistakes. The researchers found that robots are great mimics, but without specific programming to handle unexpected situations, they often don't know how to proceed.

Traditionally, when a robot encounters issues, it exhausts its pre-programmed options before requiring human intervention. This poses a particular challenge in unstructured environments like homes, where any changes can disrupt a robot's functioning. Imitation learning, which involves robots learning tasks through observation, is common in home robotics. However, it struggles to account for the countless small variations in the environment that can interfere with regular operation. This often requires the robot to start over.

The new research addresses this challenge by breaking demonstrations into smaller subsets instead of treating them as part of a continuous action. This is where LLMs come into play, eliminating the need for manual labeling and assignment of subactions by programmers.

LLMs have the ability to provide instructions for each step of a task in natural language. By connecting a human's continuous demonstration of the task with the LLM's instructions, the robot can automatically determine its stage in the task and replan and recover on its own, according to Tsun-Hsuan Wang, a graduate student involved in the research.

The study showcases a demonstration where a robot is trained to scoop marbles and pour them into an empty bowl. While this is a simple task for humans, it involves various small tasks for robots. The LLMs can list and label these subtasks. During the demonstrations, the researchers purposely sabotaged the activity by bumping the robot off course and knocking marbles out of its spoon. However, the system was able to self-correct the small tasks instead of starting from scratch.

""With our method, when the robot is making mistakes, we don't need to ask humans to program or give extra demonstrations of how to recover from failures,"" Wang explains.

This research offers a promising solution to help robots recover from mistakes without requiring constant human intervention. It provides a more efficient and effective way for robots to handle unexpected situations and adapt to changes, ultimately improving their functionality and usability in various environments. So, next time you see a robot scooping marbles, you'll know it has the ability to recover and keep its marbles intact.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/CommonSense-01-press_0.jpg?w=900,2024-03-25 20:01:06,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/bankrupt-ev-startup-arrival-sold-its-assets-to-canoo/,Bankrupt EV startup Arrival sold its assets to Canoo,"Bankrupt commercial electric vehicle (EV) startup Arrival has sold some of its assets, including advanced manufacturing equipment, to struggling EV startup Canoo. This acquisition is seen as a cost-saving measure that will reduce Canoo's capital expenditures by 20%. Canoo plans to send the purchased assets, which are packed into over 20 container ships, to its facility in Oklahoma. It is unclear whether Canoo has also acquired any of Arrival's intellectual property (IP). Arrival, once valued at over $13 billion and backed by Hyundai and UPS, filed for bankruptcy protection in the UK and announced plans to sell off assets and IP from its UK division. Though Arrival aimed to revolutionize EV production with compact ""microfactories,"" it faced financial challenges and underwent multiple restructurings. Canoo, on the other hand, struggled to produce its EV after going public through a merger and has had difficulties converting sales into deliveries.

Arrival's bankruptcy and asset sale mark the downfall of a once-promising EV startup. The company's initial plans to build electric buses, vans, and a purpose-built car for Uber fell apart due to financial difficulties and executive turnover. Arrival's market valuation has plummeted from over $13 billion to around $7.7 million, and it never produced commercial vehicles at scale. The company filed for bankruptcy after years of volatility and a significant decrease in its share price.

Canoo, while also facing its own challenges, hopes that the acquisition of Arrival's assets will help propel its commercial production efforts. Canoo's unique ""skateboard"" architecture, which houses batteries and the electric drivetrain beneath the vehicle's cabin, attracted attention. The company has a sales pipeline of over $1 billion, driven primarily by a deal with Walmart to purchase up to 10,000 units. However, Canoo has struggled to convert these sales into actual deliveries. As a result, the company has resorted to stock splits and issuing more shares to maintain financial stability. Last year, Canoo's stock price dropped below $1, triggering a delisting notice from the Nasdaq Exchange.

Both Arrival and Canoo face significant hurdles in the competitive EV market. While Arrival's bankruptcy and asset sale may mark the end of its journey, Canoo hopes to leverage the acquired assets to overcome its production challenges and establish itself as a player in the EV industry. Only time will tell if these struggling startups can find success amidst fierce competition and financial struggles.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/canoo-walmart-arkansas.jpg?resize=1200,670",2024-03-25 22:15:20,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-pairing-crypto-green-hydrogen-energy.html,"Pairing crypto mining with green hydrogen offers clean energy boost, study suggests","Pairing cryptocurrency mining, known for its high carbon emissions, with green hydrogen technology has the potential to drive renewable energy deployment, according to a recent study conducted by Cornell University. The research, titled ""Climate Sustainability Through a Dynamic Duo: Green Hydrogen and Crypto Driving Energy Transition and Decarbonization,"" highlights the opportunity to harness the enthusiasm for cryptocurrency while moving towards a sustainable future.

Cryptocurrency mining operations contribute significantly to global carbon emissions, making it imperative to explore ways to integrate cryptocurrency with renewable energy sources. By using clean energy for blockchain mining and leveraging green hydrogen technology, the researchers suggest that renewable energy sectors can be boosted. This combination, referred to as the ""dynamic duo,"" has the potential to accelerate the production of renewable energy and create a more sustainable energy landscape.

The current structure of cryptocurrency mining in the United States alone consumes as much carbon-based energy as the entire country of Argentina, according to a report from the White House Office of Science and Technology. Most cryptocurrency mining relies on energy-intensive consensus mechanisms, known as ""proof of work,"" which verify crypto-assets. The researchers propose using cryptocurrencies as virtual energy carriers in conjunction with green hydrogen to transform the environmental challenges of cryptocurrency mining into a force for climate mitigation and sustainability.

The study also examined the energy potential of individual U.S. states. Supporting cryptocurrency mining could lead to the creation of additional energy infrastructure, potentially generating 78.4 megawatt hours of solar power for each Bitcoin mined in New Mexico and 265.8 megawatt hours of wind power for each Bitcoin mined in Wyoming.

While cryptocurrency holds a high dollar value, it is a virtual asset that cannot be physically held. Similarly, cryptocurrency can also hold an energy value, analogous to a gift card concept. The researchers emphasize the need for stronger federal policies to support climate goals and renewable energy in order to advance a sustainable future for blockchain-based cryptocurrency.

The integration of green hydrogen technology with cryptocurrency mining not only mitigates the environmental impact of mining operations but also paves the way for a sustainable transition to renewable energy. This innovative strategy has the potential to drive the adoption of renewable energy sources and contribute to climate sustainability.

Fengqi You, a professor of energy systems engineering at Cornell and senior faculty fellow at the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability, co-authored the study with doctoral student Apoorv Lal. Their research highlights the transformative potential of pairing cryptocurrency mining with green hydrogen technology and emphasizes the need for collaborative efforts to achieve a sustainable and climate-friendly future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2023/cryptocurrencies.jpg,2024-03-25 15:00:02,Innovation,Innovation
