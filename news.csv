And the guessing game continues after the baby is born, as new mothers try to determine which foods are best for postpartum and nursing. That's where Chiyo comes in.

Chiyo is a holistic fertility care company that offers nutrition advice and meals through a meal delivery service. Their goal is to provide support to women from fertility through postpartum by offering digital guides, health coaching, and a unique research database of nutrition for women's health.

The inspiration for Chiyo came from co-founder and CEO Irene Liu's personal experience. She witnessed her mother sending her aunt traditional Chinese medicine meals after giving birth and became fascinated with the concept of food as medicine. Combining her background in nutritional science with Eastern food therapy, Liu wanted to create stage-based and symptom-specific nutrition programs for other mothers.

Liu's career journey, which included working at Bain & Co. and a nonprofit in Chicago, helped shape her vision for Chiyo. She saw the potential for a local thriving economy through economic development initiatives that focus on food systems. This led her to meet co-founder Jennifer Jolorte Doro, a clinical nutritionist and postpartum private chef, and together they launched a pilot program in New York City.

The pilot program was supposed to be temporary, but it gained unexpected traction. The company's website received organic boosts on Google, and they started receiving thousands of pre-orders. This success prompted Liu and Doro to officially establish Chiyo in 2020 and begin shipping meals nationwide.

Since its launch in 2021, Chiyo has served 100,000 meals and experienced a 300% revenue growth in the past year. The company also collaborates with over 100 women's health practitioners. While their initial focus was on postpartum care, Chiyo's product roadmap is expanding to serve the full women's health journey. This includes a menstrual cycle fertility program that provides tonics and broths tailored to the user's cycle, as well as postpartum programs that adjust based on the estimated due date.

What sets Chiyo apart from other meal service providers is their mission to help users transition off their program. The average user stays on the program for about four weeks, and the 40-day postpartum program, which includes three meals per day, starts at $69 per day. Chiyo aims to be more prescriptive about the timing that impacts the outcomes on the body, such as the first six weeks of postpartum recovery.

Looking ahead, Chiyo plans to develop a digital platform for personalized customer self-guided content and nutrition programs. Users will be able to rate the efficacy of each solution and contribute to the research database of nutrition for women's health. To support these goals, Chiyo recently secured $3 million in funding led by Bread & Butter Ventures, with participation from other investors.

With this new investment, Chiyo will be able to scale its distribution through clinics and its practitioner community. They also plan to invest in additional food as medicine research. By doing so, Chiyo aims to prove the return on investment in holistic nutrition and further enhance their offerings for women's health.

In conclusion, Chiyo is revolutionizing the way women approach nutrition during pregnancy, postpartum, and beyond. Through their meal delivery service, digital guides, and health coaching, they provide personalized nutrition programs that prioritize the unique needs of each stage of a woman's journey. With their focus on food as medicine and their commitment to research and innovation, Chiyo is empowering women to take control of their health and well-being.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Chiyo_Headshot.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-26 13:30:50,Innovation,Innovation
