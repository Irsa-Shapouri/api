Researchers at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have repurposed a commonplace chemical used in water treatment facilities to create a new battery design for large-scale energy storage. This design offers a safe, economical, and water-based solution made with Earth-abundant materials. It presents another avenue for incorporating intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar energy into the nation's electric grid.

The researchers, who published their findings in Nature Communications, tested a lab-scale, iron-based battery that demonstrated remarkable cycling stability over one thousand consecutive charging cycles while maintaining 98.7% of its maximum capacity. This is a significant improvement compared to previous studies of similar iron-based batteries, which reported degradation of the charge capacity over fewer charging cycles.

Iron-based flow batteries for large-scale energy storage have been in existence since the 1980s, and some are already commercially available. However, what sets this battery apart is its unique liquid chemical formula for storing energy. The battery combines charged iron with a neutral-pH phosphate-based liquid electrolyte, or energy carrier. The crucial component of this chemical formula is nitrogenous triphosphonate, nitrilotri-methylphosphonic acid or NTMPA, which is commercially available in industrial quantities due to its use in inhibiting corrosion in water treatment plants.

Phosphonates, including NTMPA, belong to a chemical family based on the element phosphorus. Many phosphonates dissolve well in water and are nontoxic chemicals used in fertilizers and detergents, among other applications.

The development of new flow battery technologies is essential for modernizing the U.S. electric grid and providing a means of storing energy from renewable sources like wind and solar power. These batteries play a crucial role in the decarbonization strategy and can be built at any scale, from small lab-scale systems to large installations spanning city blocks.

Flow batteries consist of two chambers filled with different liquids. They charge through an electrochemical reaction and store energy in chemical bonds. When connected to an external circuit, they release the stored energy to power electrical devices. Unlike conventional batteries, flow batteries feature two external supply tanks of liquid that constantly circulate through them, serving as the battery system's ""blood supply."" The larger the electrolyte supply tank, the more energy the flow battery can store.

In the short term, grid operators aim to deploy battery energy storage systems (BESS) in urban or suburban areas near energy consumers. However, safety concerns often arise for city planners. The aqueous flow battery described in this research could address these concerns as it operates in water at neutral pH, making it a safer option. Additionally, the battery system utilizes commercially available reagents that have not been previously investigated for use in flow batteries.

The research team achieved an energy density of up to 9 watt-hours per liter (Wh/L) with their initial design. Commercialized vanadium-based systems, in comparison, have an energy density of more than twice that, at 25 Wh/L. While higher energy density batteries can store more energy in a smaller footprint, a system built with Earth-abundant materials could be scaled to provide the same energy output.

The future development of flow batteries holds promise for revolutionizing large-scale energy storage and facilitating the integration of renewable energy sources into the electric grid. By utilizing commonplace chemicals and focusing on safety, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability, researchers are paving the way for a cleaner and more reliable energy future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/new-all-liquid-iron-fl.jpg,2024-03-25 07:22:25,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.zdnet.com/article/saving-hours-of-work-with-ai-how-chatgpt-became-my-virtual-assistant-for-a-data-project/,Saving hours of work with AI: How ChatGPT became my virtual assistant for a data project,"Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been receiving a lot of attention lately, with many people hailing its capabilities. As someone who has written about AI, I must admit that I have contributed to the hype. However, it's important to remember that AI tools like ChatGPT are simply tools – they can be used to assist with projects, just like any other productivity software.

Today, I want to share a project where ChatGPT proved to be a valuable asset, saving me hours of tedious work. While you may not have a similar project in mind, I hope that my thought process and prompts will inspire you to consider using ChatGPT as a versatile tool for your own projects.

Let's dive into the project I worked on. In the coming month, I plan to publish what I like to call a ""stunt article."" These articles are fun projects that I know will capture readers' interest. The specific article I'm currently working on is a breakdown of how much computer gear I can purchase from Temu for under $100. Spoiler alert: I managed to come in at $99.77!

To put this article together, I scoured the Temu website in search of items to feature. For example, I stumbled upon an iPad keyboard and mouse combo that cost around $6. However, to stay within my $100 budget, I needed to compile all the Temu links into a spreadsheet, find the price of each item, and rearrange things until I reached my desired total budget.

The challenge, though, was converting the Temu links into a usable format. This is where ChatGPT came to the rescue.

Phase 1: Gathering the links
First, I collected all the links. For each product, I copied the link from Temu and pasted it into a Notion page. Notion, a note-taking app, allows you to create bookmark blocks that not only contain the links but also include the product names. Here's a snapshot of the page I created:

[Insert screenshot]

As you can see, I began selecting the blocks. Once I had selected all the blocks, I copied them and pasted the entire set into a text editor. Here's what it looked like:

[Insert screenshot]

The page may look messy, but the result is highly useful.

Phase 2: Identifying the data
Now, let's examine one of the data blocks. I've switched my editor out of dark mode to make it easier for you to see the data elements within the block:

[Insert screenshot]

Within each block, there are three key elements. The product name is in gold text, enclosed in braces. The base URL of the product is in green text, enclosed in parentheses. And there's a question mark that separates the main page URL from additional tracking data passed to the Temu page. In this project, I only needed the main URL. The purple sections highlight the delimiters – this is the data we'll feed into ChatGPT.

Phase 3: Teaching ChatGPT to recognize the data
To begin, I fed ChatGPT the following prompt:

""Accept the following data and await further instructions.""

Then, I copied all the information from the text editor and pasted it into ChatGPT. At this point, ChatGPT knew to expect more details.

The next step was crucial. I wanted ChatGPT to extract the titles and links while disregarding the rest of the information. Here's the prompt I used:

""The data above consists of a series of blocks. Each block begins with a section enclosed in brackets ([]). Within each block, designate this section as TITLE. Following the brackets, you'll find an open parenthesis (followed by a web URL). Extract this URL for each block, but omit everything after the question mark, including the question mark itself. Most URLs will end in .html. Designate this as URL. For each block, display the TITLE, followed by a carriage return, followed by the URL, and then two newlines.""

By naming the data, I made it easier to refer to later. Additionally, this process served as a test to ensure ChatGPT understood the assignment.

Also: Want to know how to use ChatGPT? Here's a guide.

ChatGPT successfully completed the assignment, although it did encounter a buffer limitation, causing it to stop about two-thirds of the way through. I instructed the bot to continue, and it provided me with the rest of the data.

Had I done this process manually, it would have involved a lot of tedious cutting and pasting. Thanks to ChatGPT, the task was completed in under a minute.

Phase 4: Simplifying Temu's complex titles
For my project, the titles provided by Temu were overly complex. Instead of:

""10 Inch LCD Writing Tablet, Electronis Memo With Leather Protective Case, Electronic Drawing Board For Digital Handwriting Pad Doodle Board, Gifts For""

I wanted something more concise, like:

""LCD Writing Tablet with Case""

I assigned this task to ChatGPT as well. I reminded the tool that it had previously parsed and identified the data. I find that reminding ChatGPT about the previous step helps it more reliably incorporate the instructions.

With ChatGPT's assistance, I was able to clean up the titles and make them more reader-friendly, all while maintaining their accuracy. This saved me a significant amount of time and effort.

In conclusion, generative AI tools like ChatGPT can be incredibly valuable in streamlining and automating tasks that would otherwise be time-consuming. By using ChatGPT to gather and process data, I was able to save hours of manual work, allowing me to focus on the core aspects of my project.

Whether you have a specific project in mind or are simply curious about the capabilities of AI, I encourage you to explore the possibilities of ChatGPT. It may just become your go-to workhorse tool, helping you achieve greater productivity while unleashing your creative potential.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/70d8814af33b190ff84b8faa5f9bafe13d3586e2/2024/03/25/7d1cb1ff-3bb7-4972-a6cd-33d04da76bc1/cover.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/boeing-ceo-to-leave-company-by-year-end-after-a-wave-of-safety-incidents/,Boeing CEO to leave company by year-end after a wave of safety incidents,"Boeing's CEO, Dave Calhoun, will be stepping down from his position by the end of 2024, according to the company. This decision comes in the wake of a series of safety incidents that have rocked the aircraft manufacturer.

Among these incidents was a cabin panel blowout on one of Boeing's planes, as well as several other serious safety issues. These incidents have raised concerns about the company's commitment to safety and have led to a loss of public trust.

Boeing has been actively involved in an innovation acceleration program called Aerospace Xelerated, which focuses on collaborating with startups in the aerospace industry. It remains unclear how Calhoun's departure will impact this program and the broader ecosystem of aerospace startups that work with Boeing.

In a statement, Calhoun expressed his intention to continue working on stabilizing and positioning the company for the future in the coming months. This suggests that he acknowledges the need for significant changes within Boeing to address the safety issues and regain the public's confidence.

One incident that significantly impacted Boeing's reputation was the emergency landing of an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 jet in January. This incident led to the grounding of 171 Max 9 jets for several weeks. It was the largest safety crisis for Boeing since the crashes of two Max 8 jets in 2018 and 2019, which resulted in the tragic deaths of 346 people.

In addition to Calhoun's departure, Stan Deal, who currently leads Boeing's commercial airplanes business (BCA), will also be leaving the company. Stephanie Pope has been appointed to take over BCA. Pope, who has been serving as Boeing's chief operating officer since January, previously held the position of president and CEO of Boeing Global Services.

As more information becomes available, this story will continue to develop. It is clear that Boeing is facing significant challenges in restoring its reputation and ensuring the safety of its aircraft. The leadership changes within the company indicate a recognition of the need for change and a commitment to addressing the issues that have plagued Boeing in recent years.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1910140688.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-25 12:48:28,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/timtreadgold/2024/03/25/us-and-australia-get-cosy-over-critical-metals/,U.S. And Australia Get Cosy Over Critical Metals,"The global search for critical metals necessary for innovative technologies and renewable energy is bringing the U.S. and Australia together while creating a divide with China. Recent deals involving lithium and rare earths highlight this trend.

Pilbara Minerals, a successful lithium miner in Australia, has expressed its interest in strengthening ties with the U.S. and taking advantage of the investment incentives available, despite partnering with a Chinese company on an expansion project. The plan to construct a lithium conversion plant outside of China and utilize the U.S. Government's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is still uncertain, but Pilbara management believes it can be successful. The company aims to explore new battery materials outside of China to benefit from the growing markets and subsidies offered by the U.S.

The Australian Financial Review recently summarized Pilbara Minerals' plan in a headline that read, ""Pilbara Minerals mulls building a lithium processing plant anywhere but China."" The details of how Pilbara will structure a joint venture with a Chinese partner while accessing IRA incentives are yet to be determined.

The second significant deal between Australia and the U.S. involves finding a solution to the long-standing challenge of monetizing a unique geological structure rich in rare earths and other critical minerals. The U.S. Government's trade finance arm, Export-Import Bank (EXIM), has provided a $600 million letter of interest to Australian Strategic Minerals (ASM) to aid in funding the final design and development of the Dubbo project in New South Wales. Following the EXIM announcement, ASM awarded a contract to Bechtel, a leading U.S. engineering and construction firm, to provide ore processing and infrastructure technical services.

The involvement of a government financing agency and a major engineering company solidifies U.S. support for the Dubbo project, which has spent three decades in an evaluation process aimed at generating profits from a complex orebody. Ailie MacAdam, president of Bechtel Mining and Metals, described the Dubbo project as having global strategic significance in the rare earths and critical minerals sector.

Bechtel will be tackling a range of minerals at Dubbo, including neodymium and praseodymium (high-value rare earths), tantalum (used in electronics), niobium (used for steel hardening), hafnium (used in nuclear reactor control rods), and zirconium (used in jet engines and hydrogen fuel cells). ASM's first challenge has been finding ways to separate these different metals, with the next task being to produce the required materials at a competitive price for customers.

The Dubbo project has been a focus of the Australia-U.S. Taskforce on Critical Minerals, which aims to leverage Australia's geological resources for the benefit of U.S. industry. Rowena Smith, CEO of ASM, believes the Dubbo project is well-positioned to support the joint objectives of Australia and the U.S.

In conclusion, the pursuit of critical metals for advanced technologies and renewable energy sources is strengthening the bond between the U.S. and Australia while creating a divide with China. The recent deals involving lithium and rare earths demonstrate the efforts of both countries to secure their positions in the global market. With Pilbara Minerals exploring new battery materials outside of China and ASM's collaboration with the U.S. Government and Bechtel on the Dubbo project, it is evident that both countries are actively working towards achieving their goals in the critical minerals sector.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660204347dcbbcbc0ad19587/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 21:27:14,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-deep-geothermal-renewable-powerhouse.html,Dig deep: US bets on geothermal to become renewable powerhouse,"Geothermal energy is gaining attention as a potential solution for the green transition. Despite currently accounting for a small percentage of US energy production, there is growing optimism that geothermal energy could become a reliable and scalable power source in the future. This article explores the advancements and potential of geothermal energy, highlighting the efforts of businesses and the Biden administration to promote its growth.

Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm believes that harnessing the heat beneath our feet could revolutionize energy production. Speaking at the CERAWeek conference in Houston, she expressed confidence that geothermal energy has the potential to surpass hydroelectric and solar power in the US by 2050. Currently, geothermal energy only contributes 1.6 percent to the country's energy consumption.

To accelerate the development of geothermal energy, the US government has invested over $200 million since 2018 in an experimental site in Utah. This site focuses on Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), a technology that involves drilling exceptionally deep wells and injecting water into hot rocks to generate geothermal energy. Unlike traditional geothermal methods, EGS does not require nearby hot springs or underground reservoirs. This approach has the advantage of reducing upfront drilling risks, making it more attractive to potential investors.

Moreover, the US government has streamlined the permit conversion process for oil and gas exploration companies interested in transitioning to geothermal energy. By reducing paperwork and delays, this initiative aims to encourage more companies to explore geothermal opportunities. Additionally, geothermal drilling requires fewer chemical additives compared to classic fracking methods, making it more environmentally friendly.

Geothermal energy distinguishes itself from other renewable energy sources like solar or wind power because it provides a steady flow of energy regardless of weather conditions or time of day. This reliability makes geothermal energy an attractive option for industries and households alike.

Cost is another significant factor in the growth of geothermal energy. The US government predicts that the cost of geothermal energy will decrease from the current range of $70 to $100 per megawatt hour (MWh) to $45 by 2035. By leveraging existing drilling technology and making slight modifications to drill bits, geothermal energy can be developed more quickly and cost-effectively. This innovation has been a significant breakthrough in advancing geothermal energy production.

While the US has been a pioneering force in geothermal technology, other countries, such as France, have also established experimental EGS sites. However, the potential risk of induced seismic activity associated with geothermal drilling requires careful consideration. The US Energy Department has implemented a mitigation protocol to address induced seismicity and is actively funding research on this issue.

Despite the challenges, the geothermal energy market is attracting significant investment. Start-ups in the US and Canada have raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors, indicating growing confidence in the sector. Major companies like Google, Microsoft, and Nucor are also joining the movement by committing to purchasing geothermal energy. Their willingness to pay a premium for this renewable energy source is encouraging for the industry.

According to experts like Cindy Taff, CEO of Sage Geosystems, the geothermal energy market is still in its early stages. The first successful commercial facility will pave the way for further growth and development within the industry. As the sector expands, it is crucial to prioritize sustainable growth to ensure the long-term success of geothermal energy.

In conclusion, geothermal energy holds immense promise as a clean and reliable power source. With technological advancements, streamlined processes, and growing investments, geothermal energy could play a significant role in the green transition. By tapping into the heat beneath the Earth's surface, geothermal energy has the potential to transform energy production and contribute to a more sustainable future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/a-worker-operates-a-dr.jpg,2024-03-25 04:59:03,Innovation,Innovation

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-household-robots-common.html,Engineering household robots to have a little common sense,"Robots are becoming increasingly proficient at performing household tasks, from cleaning up spills to serving food. These robots are often taught through imitation, where they copy the motions guided by a human. However, robots face challenges when it comes to adjusting to unexpected disruptions or bumps along the way. MIT engineers have now developed a method that combines robot motion data with the ""common sense knowledge"" of large language models (LLMs). This approach allows robots to parse household tasks into subtasks and adapt to disruptions within a subtask, without having to start from scratch or rely on explicit programming for every failure.

Yanwei Wang, a graduate student in MIT's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), explains that blindly mimicking a human's motion trajectories can lead to accumulated errors that derail the robot's execution. With their method, robots can self-correct execution errors and improve overall task success. Wang and his colleagues will present their new approach at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024) in May.

To illustrate their method, the researchers use the example of scooping marbles from one bowl and pouring them into another. Traditionally, engineers would guide a robot through the motions of scooping and pouring in one continuous trajectory, providing multiple demonstrations for the robot to mimic. However, the team realized that a single task consists of a sequence of subtasks. For example, the robot must first reach into a bowl, then scoop up marbles, and finally move to the empty bowl. If a robot makes a mistake during any of these subtasks, it typically has to start from the beginning. Wang notes that explicitly labeling each subtask and creating new demonstrations for recovery can be tedious.

Instead, the researchers found that language models can automatically generate logical lists of subtasks. By prompting the language model to list the actions involved in scooping marbles, the model might produce verbs such as ""reach,"" ""scoop,"" ""transport,"" and ""pour."" The researchers aimed to connect the natural language labels generated by the language models with the robot's physical position or state. This process, known as ""grounding,"" involves mapping the robot's coordinates or an image of the robot's state to the language labels.

The team developed an algorithm for this purpose, allowing the robot to automatically know its stage in a task and enabling it to replan and recover on its own. By combining robot motion data with the knowledge from language models, the robot gains a sense of common sense and can handle disruptions without requiring explicit programming for every failure.

The researchers' method has significant implications for the future of household robots. It provides a more efficient and adaptable approach to training robots, allowing them to handle unforeseen disruptions and errors. The use of language models adds a layer of understanding and context to the robot's actions, enabling it to self-correct and improve task success rates. This research represents a step forward in developing robots that can navigate complex household tasks with ease.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/engineering-household.jpg,2024-03-25 09:48:20,Innovation,Innovation

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-strategy-suppress-strain-propagation-ultrahigh.html,A strategy to suppress strain propagation in ultrahigh-Ni cathodes during fast charging,"To support the growing demand for the electronics industry and the widespread use of electric vehicles, researchers are continuously working on developing advanced battery technologies. One approach with great potential is the use of nickel-rich layered oxides as cathode materials in lithium-ion batteries (LiBs).

Nickel-rich cathodes offer several advantages, including increased battery capacity, improved rate capabilities, and lower fabrication costs. However, these cathodes also come with limitations such as capacity degradation and structural instability during fast-charging and long-term cycling.

A group of researchers from Argonne National Laboratory and other institutes worldwide have recently introduced a new strategy to address the structural stability and reliability issues of ultrahigh-Ni cathodes. Their findings were published in the journal Nature Energy. The strategy involves the use of epitaxial entropy-assisted oxide coating to suppress strain propagation, which is a major cause of cathode failure during fast-charging and prolonged cycling.

The researchers designed a specialized oxide coating that aligns with the structure of Ni-rich cathodes. These coatings not only enhance the robustness of the cathode materials' surface but also improve ionic conductivity, enabling faster charging of batteries.

The coating is based on Wadsley-Roth crystallographic shear phases, which have been found to enhance the performance of electrodes in LiBs. These compounds adhere well to Ni-rich cathodes, strengthening their structural stability during operation and fast-charging.

The researchers conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of their coating strategy. They coated Ni-rich layered cathodes and tested their performance over time and under different conditions. The results were highly promising, as the approach significantly reduced damage to the cathodes, even during fast-charging and after multiple operation cycles.

The epitaxial entropy-assisted coating strategy not only improves the fast charging/discharging capability but also enhances the wide temperature tolerance and thermal stability of ultrahigh-Ni cathodes. Through comprehensive analysis at various scales, the researchers observed reduced lattice dislocations, anisotropic lattice strain, and oxygen release, as well as improved bulk and local structural stability.

The findings of this study open up new opportunities for surface engineering in the design and development of high-energy and high-power LiBs and beyond. By addressing the challenges associated with nickel-rich cathodes, researchers can pave the way for more efficient and reliable battery technologies, supporting the increasing demand for electronics and electric vehicles.

In conclusion, the use of epitaxial entropy-assisted oxide coating provides a promising solution to enhance the structural stability and reliability of ultrahigh-Ni cathodes in lithium-ion batteries. This strategy offers numerous benefits, including improved fast charging/discharging capability, wider temperature tolerance, and thermal stability. With further research and development, this coating strategy could revolutionize battery technologies and meet the growing demands of the electronics industry and electric vehicle market.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/a-strategy-to-suppress.jpg,2024-03-25 09:40:01,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/lucid-motors-1-billion-saudi-arabia-gravity-suv/,Lucid Motors raises another $1 billion from Saudi Arabia as it searches for luxury EV buyers,"Lucid Motors has secured an additional $1 billion in funding from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund through its affiliate Ayar Third Investment. This investment will help offset the high costs associated with producing and selling its luxury electric sedan.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-method-quantum-mechanics-lithium-metal.html,New method that uses quantum mechanics can lead to improved lithium metal batteries,"A recent study published in Nature Energy by Dr. Perla Balbuena and Dr. Jorge Seminario from Texas A&M University presents a groundbreaking method for understanding the effects of external pressure on lithium-metal batteries. By utilizing quantum mechanics, the researchers aim to improve the fabrication processes of lithium-metal batteries, resulting in longer-lasting and more efficient battery technologies.

Dr. Balbuena emphasizes the significance of this work, stating that it demonstrates the impact of first-principles ab initio analysis on the design of macroscopic processes. She believes that similar methods can be applied to enhance chemical and physical processes in various fields such as chemical engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, materials science, and biology.

This research is part of the Battery500 Consortium, a collaboration among national labs and academia, led by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. The consortium aims to develop more reliable and high-performing vehicle batteries in line with the goals set by the Department of Energy.

Lithium-ion batteries have revolutionized the world of mobile electronics, enabling the development of compact devices that can be conveniently carried in our pockets. These batteries are widely used in smartphones, watches, laptops, electric vehicles, and grids. However, they still face several challenges, with one of the most significant being their limited energy density, mainly caused by the battery components.

Dr. Seminario explains that lithium-ion batteries rely on two essential electrodes to store and transport energy. The anode, or the negative electrode, contains lithium ions with maximum energy, while the cathode, or the positive electrode, contains lithium ions with minimum energy. During discharge, lithium ions naturally migrate from the anode to the cathode, allowing the transfer of electrical energy to power external devices.

To overcome the limitations of current lithium-ion batteries, researchers are exploring alternative materials. One promising avenue is replacing the conventional graphite anode with lithium metal, which could potentially increase energy density by a factor of ten. However, lithium metal is highly reactive, requiring innovative control measures such as applying external pressure to the battery.

Although external pressure has been shown to significantly impact cell performance, there is currently limited research on the relationship between external pressure and the electroplating of lithium in large-format pouch cells. Additionally, when batteries undergo cycling, their components may experience volume changes, leading to cell swelling and decreased battery performance.

The study conducted by the Texas A&M team focuses on understanding how external pressure affects the distribution of lithium ions on the anode, with the objective of preventing the formation of dendrites. Dendrites are tiny needle-like structures that can potentially cause short-circuiting in batteries. By employing theoretical-computational techniques, the researchers meticulously analyze the effects of pressure on lithium-metal anodes.

Dr. Balbuena explains that they used quantum mechanical analysis to study the migration of lithium ions from the cathode to the anode. By understanding the trajectories of the lithium ions, they can predict the subsequent electrodepositions on the anode surface, which is modified by the pressure effect.

The key discovery of this research is that lithium ions tend to detour towards regions with higher pressure or a higher concentration of lithium atoms on the surface. This behavior is attributed to the electric field generated by the lithium-metal anode.

This finding has significant implications as it allows researchers to predict the behavior of novel materials proposed for advanced applications. Understanding the behavior of ions under these conditions can lead to the widespread use of lithium-metal batteries with longer battery life, increased functionality, and less expensive infrastructure and fabrication processes.

In conclusion, the study by Dr. Balbuena and Dr. Seminario sheds light on the impact of external pressure on lithium-metal batteries using quantum mechanics. Their findings have the potential to revolutionize battery technologies, leading to more efficient and longer-lasting batteries for various applications. This research contributes to the ongoing efforts of the Battery500 Consortium in developing high-performing vehicle batteries in line with the Department of Energy's goals.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/new-discovery-can-lead.jpg,2024-03-25 17:06:08,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/match-board-directors-after-talks-activist-investor-elliott-management/,Match appoints two board directors after talks with activist investor Elliott Management,"Tinder-owner Match Group has recently made some significant moves, appointing two new members to its board of directors and entering into an agreement with Elliott Management, an activist investor. Laura Jones, the chief marketing officer at Instacart, and Spencer Rascoff, co-founder of Zillow, will be joining the board, effective immediately.

According to Match, these appointments were the result of a ""constructive dialogue"" with Elliott Management, with the two companies entering into an ""information-sharing"" agreement. This development comes a few months after The Wall Street Journal reported that Elliott had acquired a stake of around $1 billion in Match Group. The report suggested that Elliott was interested in discussing strategies for improving Match's performance, as the company has been experiencing a decline in paying users due to economic uncertainty.

Marc Steinberg, a partner at Elliott, expressed confidence in Match Group's potential for value creation as the global leader in online dating. He stated, ""We appreciate the collaboration with management and the Board over the past several months, and we are confident that Laura Jones and Spencer Rascoff are strong additions to the Board. We believe their unique skills and perspectives will help support the Company through its next phase of growth."" Elliott Management is known for its involvement in tech companies and its ability to drive changes by acquiring stakes in these companies. This move to push for change at Match follows similar actions taken with Crown Castle and Etsy.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, Match Group experienced a 5% decline in its total number of paid users compared to the previous year, with a total of 15.2 million paid users. The company's growth has slowed down from the peaks it reached during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a 79% decline in its stock since its peak in 2021.

It's important to note that Match Group is the parent company of various popular dating apps, including Tinder, Hinge, Match.com, Meetic, OkCupid, Hinge, Plenty of Fish, and OurTime.

As Match Group continues to navigate the challenges of a changing market and economic uncertainties, the addition of Laura Jones and Spencer Rascoff to its board of directors, along with the collaboration with Elliott Management, is expected to bring fresh perspectives and expertise to support the company's growth in the next phase. This move underscores Match's commitment to adapt to the evolving online dating landscape and regain its momentum in the industry. With its portfolio of well-known dating apps, Match Group remains a significant player in the online dating market.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1241790742.jpeg?w=1024,2024-03-25 14:15:04,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/25/google-update-warning-chrome-windows-11-android-iphone/,Google’s New AI Search Goes Horribly Wrong-M Is For Malware,"Be cautious of what you search for, as Google's new AI search feature is causing some unexpected problems. The transition from traditional search to AI-powered search is meant to bring a new, exciting experience to users. However, the initial update seems to have gone wrong.

Google's goal is to enhance search with generative AI and has introduced its Search Generative Experience (SGE) to give users a taste of how this new mechanism will transform search results. Unfortunately, an SEO consultant discovered scams within the search results while testing the new technology. Bleeping Computer confirmed these findings and warned that the AI-powered algorithms recommend scam sites that lead visitors to unwanted Chrome extensions, fake iPhone giveaways, browser spam subscriptions, and tech support scams.

The issue with generative AI is that these dangers are disguised in friendly and conversational language, catching users off guard. Many of the fraudulent redirects aimed to collect personal information or persuade users to subscribe to unwanted services for commission payments. Some of the links were even more dangerous, forcing unwanted browser extensions that hijack search results and potentially engage in other malicious activities.

Google responded to Bleeping Computer by stating that they continuously update their advanced spam-fighting systems to keep spam out of search results. They assured that they utilize these anti-spam protections to safeguard the Search Generative Experience. Furthermore, Google confirmed that they have taken action to remove the examples mentioned, which were showing up for uncommon queries. However, no further comments have been provided by Google regarding these issues.

Although the SGE feature has been opt-in until now, Google plans to expand its reach. They have started showing AI-powered overviews to users who have not signed up for the feature. This test is currently being conducted on a small percentage of search traffic in specific categories, limited to users in the United States, even if they are not logged into a Google account.

It is important to note that the examples of scams were observed by an opt-in Search Labs user and not a general user experiencing AI test results. Hopefully, by the time the feature is released more widely, any issues will have been resolved.

Nevertheless, this situation highlights the fact that this new AI-powered search brings forth an entirely new threat landscape that can be exploited with new tricks, targeting an audience that may not yet be aware of these dangers. Despite the friendly language used, it is crucial to remember that the same rules of safe searching still apply.

As search becomes more integrated into generative AI chatbots, without the luxury of viewing search results, these problems will likely worsen. It is imperative that filters and defenses are significantly improved before this integration takes place.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6602155031526c87ed877205/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3115,2027,x1040,y734,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 21:15:00,Innovation,Innovation
