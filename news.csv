https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have followed similar growth trajectories, with both companies capitalizing on unexpected opportunities. AWS discovered that it could sell its internal services, such as storage and compute, while Nvidia realized that its gaming GPU was well-suited for AI workloads. This led to explosive revenue growth for both companies, particularly in their data center businesses.

However, while AWS has consistently been a revenue driver for Amazon, its growth has begun to slow down. In contrast, Nvidia's revenue growth has been astronomical in recent quarters and is expected to continue. The company anticipates $24 billion in revenue for the current quarter, a growth rate of around 234% compared to the previous year.

Nvidia's short-term financial outlook remains strong, with analysts expecting the company to generate over $110 billion in revenue in the current fiscal year. Although this is lower than the growth rate in the previous fiscal year, it is still impressive for a mature company. Analysts and Nvidia foresee significant growth potential for the company in the coming quarters, even if the growth rate may slow down.

AI is expected to be a major driver of growth for Nvidia in the coming years, despite increasing competition from other chipmakers such as AMD and Intel. Nvidia currently controls a significant portion of the market and can afford to face stiffer competition. However, market dynamics may change in the future.

At the chip level, Nvidia remains firmly in control, according to IDC. However, AMD is gaining ground at the board level, as per market share numbers from Jon Peddie Research. This indicates that competition is intensifying, but Nvidia still holds a dominant position.

In conclusion, Nvidia's growth trajectory resembles that of AWS, with both companies benefiting from unexpected opportunities. While AWS's growth has slowed down, Nvidia's revenue continues to skyrocket. The company's short-term financial outlook remains strong, and AI is expected to be a key driver of growth in the coming years. Although competition is increasing, Nvidia's market position is still formidable.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/25/google-upgrade-samsung-s24-s23-pixel-towards-apple-iphone-15-pro-max/,Google Suddenly Reveals Surprise Android Update That Beats iPhone,"Android and iPhone are constantly competing to attract users, and Google has recently made strides in making Android more like the iPhone. In a surprising move, Google has introduced a new feature that not only matches an existing iPhone feature but goes above and beyond. This update is a significant step forward for the safety and security of Android users.

One notable addition is the emergency satellite service which finally brings Android on par with iPhone's satellite SOS functionality. This feature is especially useful for those in remote areas or engaging in outdoor activities. Google's offering even includes a Garmin rescue service, further enhancing the safety measures for Android users.

However, Apple's emergency SOS feature is limited to emergencies only, making it less practical for everyday situations. With the latest Android 15 developer preview, Google is bridging this gap by allowing users to expand their cellular accounts to include a satellite add-on. This enables core messaging apps to utilize the satellite network, eliminating the issue of cellular black spots and ensuring connectivity in remote areas.

Android 15 also introduces a new API that allows apps to detect when a device is connected to a satellite. This opens up possibilities for SMS/MMS/RCS apps to use satellite connectivity for sending and receiving messages. This is a significant development, especially considering that some networks have plans to add low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite connectivity as an account option.

While Apple also offers satellite connectivity, it remains more limited. Apple's feature allows users to text emergency services, request roadside assistance, and share their location with friends and family when they have no mobile or Wi-Fi coverage. However, Android's potential integration with T-Mobile for satellite messaging suggests a future where direct-to-phone satellite connectivity becomes more commonplace.

The recent news of SpaceX achieving download speeds of 17mbps to an unmodified Galaxy S21 Ultra further emphasizes the potential for satellite connectivity. This means that even without conventional cellular network range, smartphones could make and receive calls and messages by connecting directly to a satellite. While this future may not be here yet, the integration of messaging functionality is a promising start.

It is confirmed that these satellite messaging features will be introduced in Android 15, barring any major changes. This development showcases Google's ability to lead in innovation, with Apple likely to follow suit. This comes at a time when Gemini, Google's workhorse, might be coming to Apple's iPhone, further closing the gap between Android and iPhone. The competition between the two operating systems continues to drive advancements and improvements for users.

In conclusion, Google's latest update for Android brings exciting new features, including satellite connectivity for messaging. This improvement bridges the gap between Android and iPhone, with Google leading the way. The integration of satellite functionality enhances the safety and connectivity options for Android users. As Android and iPhone become more similar, users can expect a more seamless experience regardless of their preferred operating system.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65d79ec3dadcd6b682668331/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 00:06:15,Innovation,Innovation

The weekend was quite peculiar. Just as we were welcoming the sunny and lovely spring season, it surprised us with half a foot of snow. The weather turned cold and wintry, and although I was eagerly awaiting warmer days, I must admit, it does look quite beautiful outside. 

Now, let's get back to work and Wordling! Let's do this!

Wordle Analysis

Every day, I eagerly check Wordle Bot to see how well I did. You can also check your Wordles with Wordle Bot right here. 

I must confess, this one had me quite puzzled. Things started off poorly, with numerous possibilities leaving me with a whopping 195 remaining solutions. Even with the hint of ""boink,"" I was only able to reduce it to 40, and I found myself floundering. 

Fortunately, my guess of ""allay"" turned out to be a great one. It informed me that there was more than one 'L' and left me with just one word to consider. I almost went with ""palsy"" before realizing I needed another 'L.' After some brainstorming, I finally settled on ""sally,"" which I usually associate with a person's name. However, it also refers to an old battle tactic. 

Competitive Wordle Score

Once again, it's a tie. No points for guessing in four or matching the Bot's answer. Just a disappointing zero. 

The Etymology of Today's Wordle

When used as a non-proper noun, the word ""sally"" primarily means to suddenly rush forth or launch a sudden attack from a defensive position. It can also refer to setting out on a journey or embarking on a new venture. The etymology of ""sally"" in this context is quite fascinating, tracing back through multiple languages before finding its way into English. 

The term originates from the Middle French word ""sallie,"" which is the noun form of ""sallir,"" meaning ""to rush out, leap forth."" ""Sallir"" itself comes from the Latin word ""salire,"" which means ""to leap."" This Latin root has given rise to various related words in English, such as ""salient"" (prominently projecting) and ""assail"" (to attack), all of which reflect the concept of movement or leaping forth. 

Therefore, the etymology of ""sally"" reflects the action of moving out or leaping forth, often with a sense of suddenness or unexpectedness. This applies both to physical attacks from fortified positions and to embarking on new journeys or ventures.
