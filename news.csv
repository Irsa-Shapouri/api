https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/apple-sued-microsofts-ai-ambitions-and-nvidia-surprises/,"Apple sued, Microsoft's AI ambitions and Nvidia's surprises","Welcome to this edition of Week in Review, where we bring you the latest news and updates in the tech world. In this week's highlights, we'll be discussing the Apple antitrust lawsuit, Microsoft's AI ambitions, Reddit's IPO, Nvidia's GTC event, and more. So let's get started!

First up, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has joined international regulators in accusing Apple of using monopolistic tactics with its iPhones. Apple, on the other hand, argues that the DOJ's actions could harm what users love about its phones and ecosystem. While there are comparisons drawn between Apple and Microsoft's antitrust case in the 1990s, there are notable differences between the two companies' efforts to retain customers. However, experts predict that it could take several years for the lawsuit to reach a resolution.

Moving on to Microsoft, the tech giant made headlines this week with its acquisition of Inflection AI. Mustafa Suleyman, one of the co-founders of the AI startup, will now lead Microsoft's consumer-facing unit for AI, while Karén Simonyan takes on the role of EVP and CEO of the same group. This acquisition comes after Inflection raised $1.3 billion, with Microsoft being one of its major investors.

Nvidia also made waves with its GTC developer conference. CEO Jensen Huang made some surprising announcements, including a prediction that artificial general intelligence is just five years away. Additionally, Nvidia introduced a new AI platform called GR00T, designed for humanoid robots. It's exciting to see the advancements in AI and the potential it holds for the future.

In other news, Google and Apple are reportedly in talks that could lead to Google's AI model being deployed on iPhones. This raises questions about whether it's a temporary solution until Apple's own AI efforts catch up, a long-term partnership, or a negotiation that may not come to fruition. It will be interesting to see how this collaboration plays out in the future.

Now, let's turn our attention to hacking and privacy concerns. The Biden administration is rallying an international coalition to combat commercial spyware, and investors are joining the fight. However, it has come to light that one of these investors was previously involved in the very business they are now fighting against. It's a reminder that we should always be cautious and scrutinize the actions and intentions of those involved in the tech industry.

In the gaming world, a hack disrupted a $5 million Apex Legends tournament, with the hacker claiming it was done for fun and to draw attention to an exploit. This incident highlights the need for developers to be vigilant and address vulnerabilities to ensure fair gameplay.

Glassdoor, the popular job review platform, faced criticism this week as users reported that their real names were added to their profiles without consent. The only solution offered to affected users was to delete their accounts entirely. This serves as a reminder to be mindful of the information we share online and to double-check privacy settings on platforms we use.

In the funding and IPO space, Reddit had a successful IPO, with its stock jumping 48% on the first day of trading. Astera Labs, a company specializing in connectivity hardware for cloud computing data centers, also experienced significant growth, with its stock closing at an impressive $62.03 on day one. These success stories demonstrate the continued interest and investment in the tech industry.

Lastly, we have a bonus round of news. AI-generated images often have spelling errors, and we explored why this is the case. Despite its massive potential, AI still struggles with spelling simple words like ""burrito."" Additionally, Fisker, an electric vehicle company, has paused production due to financial difficulties. If the company fails to raise more capital, it may cease operations altogether. Finally, we discussed the importance of reviewing AI systems, even though they can be challenging to assess comprehensively.

That wraps up this edition of Week in Review. We hope you found these updates informative and engaging. Stay tuned for more exciting news in the tech world, and until next time!","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/apple-antitrust-doj-splash.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-23 20:15:37,Innovation,Innovation

The iPhone 15 series has lagged behind in the AI race compared to flagship Android devices that heavily promote generative AI. While current AI features like image processing and predictive text input are present in iOS, generative AI is expected to make its debut in the upcoming iOS 18, set to be launched at the Worldwide Developer Conference this summer and featured in the iPhone 16 lineup.

Apple, like other smartphone manufacturers, will focus on a combination of on-device and cloud-based AI processing. Tim Cook and his team are likely to emphasize Apple's commitment to preserving user data on the device for local processing, while also leveraging cloud capabilities for more intensive AI tasks.

In a surprising move, Apple is reportedly in talks with Google to utilize its Gemini generative AI service for cloud-based AI processing. Despite Google's dominance in the Android market, the two tech giants have collaborated on various fronts, including the default search engine on Apple devices. Google stands to gain access to a vast user base of AI-enabled iPhone owners, a valuable asset as it competes with other AI providers like OpenAI.

However, due to regulatory restrictions and limitations on Google's Gemini service in China, Apple is exploring a partnership with Baidu, a leading Chinese tech company known for its cloud-based AI services. This strategic move aligns with Apple's goal of offering cutting-edge AI capabilities to its users worldwide.

Notably, Samsung's recent Galaxy Unpacked event showcased not only the new Galaxy S24 lineup but also the integration of Google Gemini in its AI services. Similarly, Baidu is positioned as a key player in the Chinese market, providing AI solutions to users in the region.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianmazique/2024/03/23/ufcs-dana-white-cuts-fighter-immediately-after-he-bit-an-opponent/,UFC’s Dana White Cuts Fighter Immediately After He Bit An Opponent,"Pressure and combat sports can bring out the worst in people. This was evident during the recent UFC Fight Night: Ribas vs. Namajunas event, where a shocking incident occurred. In his UFC debut, Igor Severino, a Brazilian fighter, resorted to biting his opponent, Andre Lima, in the second round of their preliminary bout.

The incident took place while Severino was in a standing grappling position behind Lima. It was a clear act of aggression, confirmed by images that showed visible bite marks on Lima's arm. As a result, Severino was disqualified from the fight.

This was a significant blow to Severino's career, as he had the opportunity to make a name for himself in the UFC. However, his actions on that fateful night will make it challenging for him to regain his position in the promotion.

Severino, only 20 years old at the time, now has to face the consequences of his actions. Not only did he suffer his first career loss, dropping his record to 9-1, but he also received immediate repercussions from UFC CEO Dana White. White made the decision to cut Severino from the promotion, stating, ""Those were two up-and-coming undefeated fighters. If you get frustrated and want out of the fight, there are plenty of ways to do it, but the worst thing you can do is bite your opponent. Now, you get cut and lose the biggest opportunity of your life. Not to mention, he’s going to have real problems with the NSAC.""

Biting in combat sports is not a new phenomenon, but it is always a reprehensible act. Despite the shock and pain inflicted upon him, Lima remarkably remained composed throughout the incident. He calmly informed the referee about the bite, triggering a brief investigation into the matter.

For Severino, this incident marks a major setback in his career. He will need to rebuild his reputation by competing in smaller promotions before he can even dream of returning to the UFC, Professional Fighters League, or any other reputable mixed martial arts organization.

As the UFC Fight Night event in Las Vegas concludes, we look forward to more traditional results from the night's fights. Stay tuned for updates and insights on the outcomes of the matches.

In conclusion, the incident involving Igor Severino's bite during the UFC Fight Night: Ribas vs. Namajunas event highlights the extreme nature of pressure and combat sports. Severino's actions not only led to his disqualification but also resulted in his immediate dismissal from the UFC. This unfortunate event serves as a reminder of the consequences that fighters face when they resort to unsportsmanlike conduct. As the combat sports community moves forward, it is essential to uphold the integrity and respect that the sport demands.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff92c285143669667fa59c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3188,1794,x0,y217,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-23 22:45:24,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/24/debunked-i-think-ive-seen-a-total-solar-eclipse-before/,Debunked: ‘I Think I’ve Seen A Total Solar Eclipse Before’,"Total Solar Eclipses in North America: A Once-in-a-Lifetime Experience

Have you ever thought you witnessed a total solar eclipse? Chances are, you may have mistaken a partial solar eclipse for the real deal. Total solar eclipses, where the sun is completely blocked by the moon, are rare and unforgettable events that leave a lasting impression on those lucky enough to experience them.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2024/03/24/epa-didnt-ban-gas-cars-it-cut-air-pollution-so-we-can-breathe-easier/,EPA Didn’t Ban Gas Cars. It Cut Air Pollution So We Can Breathe Easier.,"On days when the air quality turns red and pollution levels spike, the bitter taste of polluted air lingers in our mouths and lungs. During these times, it is crucial to stay indoors and avoid outdoor activities, especially for vulnerable groups like the elderly, children, pregnant women, and those with respiratory conditions.

The primary culprit behind toxic air in many areas is the exhaust from internal combustion engines powered by gasoline or diesel. A significant majority of Americans rely on personal vehicles for their daily commute, making transportation the leading source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. Light-duty vehicles alone contribute to nearly 60% of the pollution in this sector, accelerating climate change and endangering public health.

Addressing this pervasive air pollution issue necessitates reducing tailpipe emissions from vehicles. Fortunately, we have a proven solution at our disposal: tailpipe emissions standards. Recently, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency took a significant step by implementing new multi-pollutant regulations for light-duty and smaller medium-duty vehicles. These updated standards will compel automakers to adopt cleaner technologies, ensuring that new vehicles are more environmentally friendly than ever before.

The freedom to choose a clean car should be accessible to everyone. Those who prioritize reducing pollution should have the option to switch to electric vehicles. Despite the benefits these updated standards offer, corporate entities that profit from selling polluting vehicles and petroleum view them as a threat to their interests. Their attempts to undermine these regulations through misinformation campaigns are aimed at misleading the public and preserving their profits.

It is essential to debunk the false narrative propagated by these profit-driven polluters. The EPA's standards are not a ban on gas cars but rather a step towards cleaner air and consumer choice. The Clean Air Act, enacted in 1970, empowers the EPA to establish air quality standards to safeguard public health and regulate harmful emissions from vehicles. Over the years, these standards have driven technological advancements in engine and emission control, leading to significant reductions in pollution levels.

Prior to the implementation of the Clean Air Act, cities like New York and Los Angeles suffered from severe air pollution, with conditions comparable to smoking multiple packs of cigarettes daily. The catalytic converter and the shift to unleaded fuel were among the innovations that emerged in response to the Act, significantly improving air quality in urban areas.

In conclusion, the recent updates to tailpipe emissions standards mark a crucial milestone in the fight against air pollution and climate change. By embracing cleaner technologies and promoting consumer choice, we can create a healthier environment for all individuals. It is imperative to support these initiatives and reject the misinformation spread by those seeking to prioritize profits over public health.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fe401fc35aefb76700b52e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 07:45:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/anuradhavaranasi/2024/03/24/which-adhd-medications-could-lower-risk-of-suicide--hospitalization/,Which ADHD Medications Could Lower Risk Of Suicide & Hospitalization?,"A recent study conducted by researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden has found that individuals prescribed ADHD stimulant medications have a lower risk of attempting suicide or dying by suicide. The study, which included over 200,000 adults and adolescents with ADHD, also revealed that the use of these medications was associated with fewer psychiatric hospitalizations.

The researchers specifically looked at four ADHD medications – amphetamine, lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate – and found that they were all linked to a decreased risk of hospitalization due to psychiatric co-morbidities. However, when it came to suicidal behavior, only lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate showed a decreased risk.

This study builds upon previous research that has shown a high prevalence of psychiatric co-morbidity among individuals with ADHD. In fact, a 2019 study in Sweden found that 52% of children and adults with ADHD had a psychiatric co-morbidity, compared to just 7% among those without ADHD. These co-morbidities can include conditions such as major depressive disorder, panic disorder, substance abuse, generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, PTSD, and psychotic symptoms.

The 2019 study also revealed that psychiatric co-morbidity increased the risk of mortality among individuals with ADHD, especially when substance use disorder was involved.

While the researchers found that atomoxetine, another ADHD medication, was not associated with a lower risk of psychiatric hospitalizations or suicidal behavior, they did find a link between atomoxetine use and fewer hospitalizations for non-psychiatric co-morbidities.

Overall, the researchers believe that ADHD medications, particularly stimulants, not only improve ADHD symptoms but also have beneficial effects on psychiatric outcomes and quality of life. However, they acknowledge that more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effectiveness and safety of these medications.

For this study, the researchers analyzed data from a nationwide cohort of individuals in Sweden aged 16 to 65 who had received an ADHD diagnosis between 2006 to 2021. They collected inpatient and outpatient healthcare data from the Swedish National Patient Register and tracked participants' use of prescribed ADHD medications through the Prescribed Drug Register. Methylphenidate was the most commonly used medication, followed by lisdexamphetamine and atomoxetine.

The study participants were followed for a period of 15 years, during which 56% of them had a psychiatric co-morbidity. Anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and stress-related disorders were among the most common co-morbidities. Approximately 26% of participants had been hospitalized due to a psychiatric co-morbidity.

Interestingly, the study found that while lisdexamphetamine was associated with a decreased risk of psychiatric hospitalizations among adolescents, young adults, and adults aged 30 and older, methylphenidate appeared to be less effective among older adults. The researchers speculate that this could be due to the medication's initial effects diminishing over time or with age.

Additionally, atomoxetine was linked to a decreased risk of hospitalization among women but not men.

The researchers acknowledge that there are concerns about the long-term use of stimulant medications, including potential cardiovascular risks and an increased risk of seizures or psychosis. However, they emphasize that the overall effect on psychiatric outcomes in this study was beneficial.

The study was published in JAMA Network Open on March 20, 2024.

In conclusion, this study provides further evidence of the benefits of ADHD stimulant medications in reducing the risk of suicidal behavior and psychiatric hospitalizations among individuals with ADHD. It highlights the importance of medication as a treatment option for ADHD and emphasizes the need for continued research to fully understand the long-term effects and safety of these medications.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/63c28dbb82c31b7412c92cf2/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 04:09:46,Innovation,Innovation
