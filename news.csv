Quantum computers, which leverage the quantum property of superposition, have the potential to solve these problems quickly. However, when COPs involve constraints, existing quantum algorithms struggle to find near-optimal solutions within the operation time of quantum computers.

To address this challenge, researchers at Waseda University in Japan have developed a post-processing variationally scheduled quantum algorithm (pVSQA). This algorithm combines variational scheduling with a post-processing method to transform infeasible solutions into feasible ones. By doing so, it achieves near-optimal solutions for constrained COPs on both quantum annealers and gate-based quantum computers.

The pVSQA algorithm works by first generating a variational quantum state through quantum computation. This state is then used to generate a probability distribution function that includes both feasible and infeasible solutions within the constraints of the problem. The post-processing method then transforms the infeasible solutions into feasible ones, resulting in a probability distribution that only contains feasible solutions. A classical computer is then used to calculate the energy expectation value of the cost function using this new distribution. By repeating this calculation, the algorithm converges to a near-optimal solution.

The researchers conducted experiments using both simulators and real quantum devices, such as a quantum annealer and a gate-type quantum device. The results showed that pVSQA achieved near-optimal performance within a predetermined time on the simulator and outperformed conventional quantum algorithms without post-processing on real quantum devices.

This development is significant for addressing complex real-world problems across various domains. Solving combinatorial optimization problems efficiently is crucial for achieving social transformations, such as addressing climate change and sustainability goals. The pVSQA algorithm offers a promising solution for achieving these long-term social transformations.

In summary, the post-processing variationally scheduled quantum algorithm (pVSQA) developed by researchers at Waseda University is a significant advancement in solving combinatorial optimization problems using quantum computers. By combining variational scheduling with post-processing, the algorithm achieves near-optimal solutions for constrained COPs on both quantum annealers and gate-based quantum computers. This development holds promise for addressing complex real-world problems and realizing long-term social transformations.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/novel-quantum-algorith.jpg,2024-03-25 12:50:38,Innovation,Innovation
