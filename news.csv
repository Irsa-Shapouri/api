Noisy recordings of interviews and speeches can be a frustrating challenge for audio engineers. However, a German startup called AI-coustics aims to tackle this issue using generative AI to enhance the clarity of voices in videos. Recently, AI-coustics emerged from stealth with €1.9 million in funding. The company's technology goes beyond standard noise suppression and can work across any device and speaker.

Fabian Seipel, co-founder and CEO of AI-coustics, explained that their core mission is to make every digital interaction, whether it's a conference call, consumer device, or casual social media video, as clear as a broadcast from a professional studio. Seipel, an audio engineer by training, founded AI-coustics with Corvin Jaedicke, a machine learning lecturer at the Technical University of Berlin, in 2021. They were inspired to start the company after encountering poor audio quality in the online courses and tutorials they were taking. They wanted to overcome the challenge of poor audio quality in digital communications.

The market for AI-powered noise-suppressing and voice-enhancing software is already robust. AI-coustics faces competition from companies like Insoundz and Veed.io. Insoundz uses generative AI to enhance streamed and pre-recorded speech clips, while Veed.io offers a video editing suite with tools to remove background noise from clips. However, AI-coustics has a unique approach to developing the AI mechanisms for noise reduction.

AI-coustics uses a model trained on speech samples recorded in their studio in Berlin. People are paid to record samples, which are then added to a dataset to train AI-coustics' noise-reducing model. Seipel explained that they have developed a unique approach to simulate audio artifacts and problems during the training process. This includes noise, reverberation, compression, band-limited microphones, distortion, clipping, and more.

While AI-coustics' compensation scheme for creators may be a point of contention, the immediate concern is bias. Speech recognition algorithms can develop biases that harm users. To combat this, AI-coustics is focused on recruiting diverse speech sample contributors. Seipel believes that size and diversity are key to eliminating bias and making the technology work for all languages, speaker identities, ages, accents, and genders.

To test the effectiveness of AI-coustics' technology, three video clips were uploaded to their platform - an interview with an 18th-century farmer, a car driving demo, and an Israel-Palestine conflict protest. The processed clips had significantly less ambient background noise, delivering on AI-coustics' promise of boosting clarity.

Seipel envisions AI-coustics' technology being used for real-time and recorded speech enhancement. It could potentially be embedded in devices like soundbars, smartphones, and headphones to automatically boost voice clarity. Currently, AI-coustics offers a web app and API for post-processing audio and video recordings, as well as an SDK for integrating their platform into existing workflows, apps, and hardware.

AI-coustics has five enterprise customers and 20,000 users at present. The company generates revenue through a mix of subscriptions, on-demand pricing, and licensing. Their roadmap includes expanding the team and improving the underlying speech-enhancing model.

AI-coustics' innovative use of generative AI to enhance audio clarity shows promise in addressing the challenge of noisy recordings. With their unique approach and focus on diversity, they aim to provide clear and high-quality audio experiences for various digital interactions.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1009979808.jpg?resize=1200,801",2024-03-25 18:43:01,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/large-language-models-can-help-home-robots-recover-from-errors-without-human-help/,Large language models can help home robots recover from errors without human help,"Home robots have struggled to gain widespread adoption due to various challenges such as pricing, practicality, form factor, and mapping. Even when these issues are addressed, there is still the problem of what happens when a robot makes a mistake. Industrial-level robots have the resources to address these problems, but it is unreasonable to expect consumers to learn to program or hire someone for help every time an issue arises. However, new research from MIT highlights the potential of large language models (LLMs) in the robotics space to address this problem.

A study presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) in May aims to bring ""common sense"" into the process of correcting mistakes. The researchers discovered that robots are excellent mimics, but they don't necessarily know how to handle unexpected situations unless they are specifically programmed to do so. Traditionally, when a robot encounters an issue, it will exhaust its pre-programmed options before requiring human intervention. This poses a significant challenge in unstructured environments like homes, where any changes can disrupt a robot's functioning.

Imitation learning, which involves learning to perform a task through observation, is popular in the field of home robotics. However, it often fails to account for small environmental variations that can interfere with regular operation. This necessitates the robot starting the task from scratch. The new research addresses this issue by breaking demonstrations into smaller subsets instead of treating them as continuous actions.

This is where LLMs come into play. They eliminate the need for programmers to manually label and assign numerous subactions. LLMs can provide instructions for each step of a task in natural language. By connecting human demonstrations with these steps, robots can automatically identify their progress in a task and replan and recover on their own.

In the study, the researchers trained a robot to scoop marbles and pour them into a bowl. While this is a simple task for humans, it involves various small tasks for robots. The LLMs can list and label these subtasks. During the demonstrations, researchers purposely sabotaged the activity by bumping the robot off course and knocking marbles out of its spoon. Instead of starting from scratch, the system self-corrected the small tasks.

""With our method, when the robot is making mistakes, we don't need to ask humans to program or provide extra demonstrations on how to recover from failures,"" says Tsun-Hsuan Wang, a grad student involved in the study.

This research offers a promising solution to address the challenges faced by home robots. By leveraging LLMs and breaking tasks into smaller subsets, robots can autonomously correct mistakes without the need for human intervention. This advancement can significantly improve the functionality and reliability of home robots, making them more practical and user-friendly.

In conclusion, the use of large language models in the robotics space has the potential to revolutionize the performance of home robots. By enabling robots to self-correct mistakes and adapt to changing environments, these models can enhance the overall user experience. The research conducted at MIT demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach in addressing the challenges faced by home robots. With further development and implementation, home robots may finally overcome the barriers that have hindered their success in the past.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/CommonSense-01-press_0.jpg?w=900,2024-03-25 20:01:06,Innovation,Innovation

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-large-language-simple-mechanism-knowledge.html,Large language models use a surprisingly simple mechanism to retrieve some stored knowledge,"Large language models (LLMs) are complex tools used in various fields, but their inner workings are not fully understood. In an effort to gain insight into these models, researchers at MIT and other institutions explored how LLMs retrieve stored knowledge. Surprisingly, they discovered that LLMs often utilize simple linear functions to decode and recover facts. Linear functions, which involve two variables and no exponents, capture the direct relationship between the variables. By identifying linear functions for different types of facts, researchers can probe the model to understand its knowledge and storage mechanisms. Even when an LLM provides an incorrect answer, it often retains the correct information, offering potential for identifying and correcting falsehoods within the model. This approach could help reduce the model's tendency to provide inaccurate or nonsensical responses.

The research team, comprised of Evan Hernandez, Arnab Sharma, Jacob Andreas, David Bau, and others, developed a technique to estimate these simple functions. They found that even though LLMs are highly complex and trained on vast amounts of data, they contain simple mechanisms. The team wrote a paper detailing their findings, which will be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024) in Vienna.

LLMs, also known as transformer models, are neural networks that consist of interconnected nodes or neurons grouped into layers. These models encode and process data, with much of their knowledge represented as relations connecting subjects and objects. For example, the relation ""Miles Davis plays the trumpet"" connects Miles Davis (subject) to the trumpet (object). As a transformer gains more knowledge, it stores additional facts about a subject across multiple layers. When a user poses a question about a subject, the model must decode the most relevant fact to provide an accurate response.

To understand how LLMs decode relational information, the researchers conducted a series of experiments. Despite their complexity, the models utilize simple linear functions for decoding. Each function is specific to the type of fact being retrieved. For instance, one decoding function may be used to output the instrument a person plays, while another function may be employed to output the state where a person was born.

The researchers developed a method to estimate these simple functions and calculated functions for 47 different relations, such as ""capital city of a country"" and ""lead singer of a band."" While there are countless possible relations, the researchers focused on this subset as they are representative of facts that can be expressed in this manner. They tested each function by altering the subject to determine if it could recover the correct object information.

These findings shed light on the inner workings of LLMs and provide insights into how they retrieve and decode stored facts. By understanding these mechanisms, researchers can potentially identify and correct inaccuracies within the models. The research presents a step towards improving the accuracy and reliability of large language models, benefiting their use in various applications.

In conclusion, large language models utilize simple linear functions to retrieve and decode stored facts. Despite their complexity, these models exhibit straightforward mechanisms that can be probed and understood. The research conducted by MIT and other institutions offers valuable insights into the inner workings of LLMs and provides a foundation for enhancing their accuracy and reducing potential inaccuracies. By further exploring and refining these mechanisms, scientists can unlock the full potential of large language models in numerous fields.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/large-language-models-2.jpg,2024-03-25 09:34:06,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/karlfreund/2024/03/25/synopsys-announces-new-ai-driven-solutions/,Synopsys Announces New AI-Driven Solutions,"Synopsys CEO Sassine Ghazi recently made his debut at SNUG, accompanied by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. The discussion revolved around the collaboration between the two companies and other related topics.

It was surprising to learn about the close relationship between Synopsys and Nvidia. Jensen shared that in the early days of Nvidia, Synopsys provided them with numerous printed manuals, which were crucial for their operations. This collaboration proved to be vital for Nvidia's success, as they needed Synopsys' simulation and design tools to avoid potential errors in their chips. This partnership has since become an important part of both companies' histories.

One of the main topics discussed during the conference was the challenges faced by chip designers. Chip complexity, chiplets, and the intersection of systems design and silicon design were all highlighted. The collaboration between Nvidia and Synopsys has resulted in a significant improvement in chip design workflow, with a 10-15 fold increase in productivity. They are now venturing into generative AI and systems software.

Synopsys has made significant advancements in design capture with their AI-enhanced platform, DSO.AI. They have also integrated reinforcement learning into validation, test, and analog space designs. These AI-driven tools have been used in numerous customer tape-outs and have led to substantial improvements in performance, power, and area (PPA). They have also significantly reduced turn-around time, improved verification coverage, accelerated testing, and optimized analog circuits. Additionally, Synopsys has incorporated AI into their data analytics platforms, resulting in better PPA and higher manufacturing yields.

Another notable development by Synopsys is Synopsys.ai, a generative AI solution that assists junior members of chip design teams by providing answers to questions about various AI tools and cloud service offerings. This solution is built using reinforcement learning, which remains the state-of-the-art technique for solving game-theory problems.

Synopsys is now applying AI to 3D chip design, which presents thermal design challenges. Their new Platform Architect - Multi-Die and 3DSO.ai can significantly increase productivity and resolve thermal challenges in a matter of hours. They have also introduced the ZeBu EP2 emulation and prototyping platform, capable of emulating chips up to 5.6B gates in size. This platform is essential for software bring-up, software/hardware validation, and power/performance analysis.

In the Hardware Assisted Verification (HAV) space, Synopsys has launched the HAPS®-100 12 system, which is their highest capacity and density FPGA-based prototyping system. This system is particularly useful for prototyping large designs, such as multi-die systems and large SoCs. It shares a common hardware platform with the ZeBu EP2.

Sassine also touched on the concept of hyperconvergence, which involves optimizing the various layers of the EDA stack. By applying AI to this level of abstraction and models, hidden performance, power, and area (PPA) opportunities can be uncovered and addressed. This approach allows for further optimization and improvement. While the benefits of hyperconvergence AI are yet to be quantified, Synopsys already has several customers testing the concept and models.

In conclusion, Synopsys envisions a future where rote engineering work is increasingly automated, leading to improved performance, power, and cost-efficiency in chip design and fabrication. Skilled design engineers will be able to focus on tasks that require their expertise, particularly in architectural design and software development. This shift is expected to revolutionize the chip design industry, with simple chips being automated to a certain extent.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6601db5b15f89b34297df1e1/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 18:54:54,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/fisker-trading-suspended-by-nyse/,Fisker trading suspended by NYSE,"The New York Stock Exchange made a significant announcement on Monday, stating that it will suspend trading of the shares of electric vehicle (EV) startup Fisker. Furthermore, it plans to remove the company from its stock exchange altogether. The NYSE declared that Fisker's stock is no longer suitable for listing due to its ""abnormally low"" price levels. This decision follows a warning that the exchange issued to Fisker a month ago, when its stock price had spent 30 consecutive days trading below $1, thereby violating the exchange's rules.

Fisker will have the opportunity to review the NYSE's determination, but in a filing on Monday afternoon, the company stated that it expects its stock to be transferred to an over-the-counter market such as OTC Pink. Additionally, Fisker disclosed that the delisting has activated repayment clauses in two outstanding loans, which it is currently unable to afford. This situation could potentially have a significant negative impact on the company's business.

The suspension of trading marks the end of a tumultuous day for Fisker, during which its shares plummeted by more than 28% before trading was halted. Earlier in the day, Fisker revealed that it had lost a potential deal with a major automaker, rumored to be Nissan. This development has also jeopardized Fisker's recently announced attempt to secure emergency funding.

Fisker did not provide an explanation for why the negotiations with the automaker were terminated, even though the conclusion of these talks was a critical condition for a potential $150 million convertible note that was announced just last week. In the filing, Fisker stated that it plans to request that the unidentified investor waive this closing condition.

The problems facing Fisker have been escalating over the past few months. The beleaguered EV startup has encountered difficulties in selling its Ocean SUV, falling short of its own internal sales targets, as previously reported by TechCrunch in January. In an effort to boost sales, Fisker shifted away from a direct sales model and turned to dealerships for assistance. However, the company has also grappled with quality issues that, at times, it has struggled to address, according to internal documents.

In February, Fisker laid off around 200 employees (equivalent to 15% of its workforce) and recently disclosed that it only has $121 million in cash reserves. The company has halted production and has warned investors that it will not survive for another year without a fresh injection of funds.

Please note that this story has been updated to include details from Fisker's Monday afternoon filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fisker-GettyImages.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-25 21:06:18,Innovation,Innovation

When we think of Amazon, we often associate it with package deliveries. However, Amazon is much more than that. It is one of the most innovative companies in the world, with significant investments in infrastructure, supply chain, IT, and transportation.

What many people may not be aware of is that Amazon has been incorporating AI and machine learning into its processes long before ""generative AI"" became a hot buzzword. This is particularly interesting in the context of our ongoing discussion about AI.

Now, Amazon is taking its AI expertise and bringing it to classrooms and virtual learning experiences. We had the privilege of speaking with Victor Reinoso, the global director of education philanthropy at Amazon, about the future of education and AI. Reinoso, who previously served as the deputy mayor of Washington D.C., brings a wealth of experience and expertise to this field.

In our conversation, Reinoso delved deep into the topic, shedding light on the challenges schools face in integrating AI education into their curriculums and how these challenges can be addressed.

One major challenge is the AI education gap. While there is a strong desire among teachers to deliver AI content to students, they often lack the necessary tools and knowledge to do so effectively. According to a recent survey conducted by Amazon and Access Partnership, 60% of educators believe that foundational AI skills should be taught from Grade 6 through university. However, nearly 70% of them lack the resources to teach the subject.

To bridge this gap, Reinoso suggests several strategies. First, funding should be provided for educator training. Amazon already invests in professional development for teachers, helping them implement sustainable K-12 STEM education initiatives and improve job readiness among students. Second, awareness and access to tools and curriculum need to be increased. There are already free resources available, such as Amazon's AI Ready commitment, which aims to provide free AI skills training to two million people by 2025. Amazon has also launched initiatives like Hour of Code Dance Party: AI Edition and AWS Generative AI Scholarships to engage students and provide them with opportunities to learn about AI.

Another important aspect of AI education is teaching responsible AI use. Teachers understand the significance of this and prioritize it in the curriculum. As AI continues to evolve, responsible AI stewardship will be crucial in guiding its application.

In conclusion, Amazon is not only a leader in e-commerce and logistics but also a pioneer in AI. By bringing AI education to classrooms, Amazon is helping to bridge the AI education gap and prepare students for the careers of the future. With the right resources, training, and emphasis on responsible AI use, we can ensure that AI becomes a force for good in our society.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/fisker-nissan-deal-dead-funding-bankruptcy/,"Fisker loses potential Nissan deal, putting rescue funds at risk","The negotiations between Fisker and a major automaker, rumored to be Nissan, for a potential investment and collaboration have come to an end. This development jeopardizes a separate funding effort that was aimed at rescuing the struggling company in the near term.

In a regulatory filing on Monday morning, Fisker disclosed that the automaker terminated the negotiations on March 22. However, the company was required to keep the negotiations ongoing as part of the closing conditions for a potential $150 million convertible note that was announced just last week. Fisker stated in the filing that it will be seeking a waiver from the unnamed investor regarding this closing condition.

Following this news, Fisker's stock plummeted by 28% when the stock market opened, resulting in a trading halt. This is just the latest setback for the EV startup, which has been facing numerous challenges. Fisker has been struggling to sell its Ocean SUV, failing to meet internal sales goals and prompting a shift away from a direct sales model. Additionally, the company has been grappling with quality issues affecting some of the delivered vehicles, causing further difficulties.

In an effort to stay afloat, Fisker laid off 15% of its workforce (around 200 people) in February and recently reported having only $121 million in its bank account. The company has paused production and has warned investors that it will not survive another year without a fresh injection of cash. While Fisker had discussions with other automakers, such as Mazda, it seems that only Nissan remained in talks until now.

Despite this setback, Fisker announced on Monday morning that it is exploring other ""strategic alternatives"" apart from the potential collaboration with Nissan. These alternatives include options such as in or out of court restructurings, capital market transactions, repurchases or refinancings of existing debt, issuance of equity securities, sale of assets and businesses, or other strategic measures.

This latest development presents a significant challenge for Fisker, as it seeks to navigate a difficult landscape in the EV market. The company will need to find alternative solutions to secure funding and sustain its operations. The next steps Fisker takes will undoubtedly have a significant impact on its future and the future of the EV industry as a whole.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1236611991.jpg?resize=1200,759",2024-03-25 13:52:11,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewwight/2024/03/25/how-are-scientists-saving-colombias-delicious-native-palm-species/,How Are Scientists Saving Colombia’s Delicious Native Palm Species,"Colombia, with its abundance of palm species, is facing a critical challenge. Over 200 Colombian palm species are at risk of extinction, including the Taparo palm and Chontaduro, which are culturally and economically important in the central and southern regions of the country. To address this issue, Alberto Gomez Mejia, a botanist and founder of the Quindio Botanical Garden, is leading an effort to protect the genetic diversity of these palms and establish sustainable commercial plantations.

Gomez Mejia's team aims to establish a gene bank to safeguard the genetic diversity of the palms. They also plan to reintroduce some examples into the wild and collaborate with locals to collect population data on the palms and study their reproduction in their natural habitat in the central Andes. With new resources, they hope to save these endangered palm species and ensure their survival.

Gomez Mejia's journey to conservation was unconventional. Born in a small town in Caldas, he initially studied law and taught philosophy. However, his interest in ecology was sparked in 1972 after the first Stockholm Conference on the human environment. This newfound passion led him to become a university professor and eventually the mayor of Armenia, earning him the nickname ""Ecologist Mayor."" He has since dedicated his career to conservation and has attended numerous national and international events on the subject.

Colombia is rich in biological diversity, but Gomez Mejia believes that the economic system has not fully utilized the potential of its flora. He emphasizes the importance of creating enterprises focused on utilizing the food, medicinal, handicraft, and ornamental plants that Colombia has to offer. With more than half of Colombian families living in food insecurity, Gomez Mejia stresses the need to tap into the nutritional power of local plants. Education and knowledge, he believes, are the keys to preserving life and biodiversity.

In addition to the efforts led by Gomez Mejia, other Colombian researchers are making important discoveries. One such researcher has found a new plant species facing a unique threat: periodic roadside maintenance. The Glossolomamagenticristatum, a pink flower found in the Colombian Andes, is at risk from the removal of roadside vegetation and the decline of Andean forests due to colonization and agriculture. Understanding the biodiversity of Colombia, its distribution, and the factors affecting its evolution is crucial for developing effective conservation and management strategies.

Laura Clavijo, an assistant professor at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia, emphasizes the importance of working with local communities to understand and protect native species. She believes that this ambitious project offers an opportunity to explore the mysteries of these beautiful plants and advance our knowledge of biodiversity.

In conclusion, Colombia's rich palm species are in danger of extinction, but dedicated researchers like Alberto Gomez Mejia are working tirelessly to protect them. By establishing gene banks, reintroducing palms into the wild, and collaborating with locals, they aim to ensure the survival of these culturally and economically important species. It is also crucial to harness Colombia's biological diversity and create enterprises focused on utilizing its plants for food, medicine, handicrafts, and ornamental purposes. With a collective effort, Colombia can preserve its unique flora and contribute to global biodiversity conservation.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660196dcec2b8dcfcc90103a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 18:24:36,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/bankrupt-ev-startup-arrival-sold-its-assets-to-canoo/,Bankrupt EV startup Arrival sold its assets to Canoo,"Bankrupt electric vehicle (EV) startup Arrival has sold its assets, including advanced manufacturing equipment, to struggling EV startup Canoo. Canoo hopes that the acquisition will help reduce capital expenditures by 20% as it tries to transition from prototypes to commercial production. The purchased assets, which are packed into more than 20 container ships, will be sent to Canoo's facility in Oklahoma. It is unclear if Canoo also acquired any of Arrival's intellectual property (IP).

Arrival announced earlier this year that it planned to sell off assets and IP from its UK division after filing for bankruptcy protection. The company, once valued at over $13 billion and backed by Hyundai and UPS, aimed to revolutionize EV production by building compact ""microfactories"" in city centers. However, Arrival's plans fell apart as it struggled with cash flow and experienced turnover in its executive team. The company restructured multiple times and shifted its focus to the US market. Despite its initial promise, Arrival never produced commercial vehicles at scale and its market valuation now sits around $7.7 million.

Canoo has faced its own challenges. After going public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, the company encountered difficulties in producing its unique EV design, which features a ""skateboard"" architecture that houses the batteries and drivetrain underneath the cabin. Despite having over $1 billion in its sales pipeline, largely due to a deal with Walmart, Canoo has struggled to convert these sales into actual deliveries. The company has been burning through cash and has had to resort to stock splits and issuing more shares to stay afloat. Its stock price fell below $1, triggering a delisting notice.

In summary, Arrival has sold its assets to Canoo as a cost-saving measure, while Canoo continues to face challenges in transitioning to commercial production. Both companies have experienced financial difficulties and are navigating a competitive and rapidly evolving EV market.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/canoo-walmart-arkansas.jpg?resize=1200,670",2024-03-25 22:15:20,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-pairing-crypto-green-hydrogen-energy.html,"Pairing crypto mining with green hydrogen offers clean energy boost, study suggests","Pairing cryptocurrency mining, known for its excessive consumption of carbon-based fuel, with green hydrogen technology could be a game-changer for renewable energy deployment, according to a recent study from Cornell University. The research, titled ""Climate Sustainability Through a Dynamic Duo: Green Hydrogen and Crypto Driving Energy Transition and Decarbonization,"" explores the potential of combining energy-intensive cryptocurrency mining with green hydrogen to boost the renewable energy sector.

Cryptocurrency operations currently contribute significantly to global carbon emissions, making it crucial to find ways to leverage the enthusiasm for cryptocurrency as we strive for a sustainable and climate-friendly future. Professor Fengqi You, an expert in energy systems engineering at Cornell, emphasizes the importance of exploring opportunities to harness the power of cryptocurrency while addressing its environmental impact.

The study highlights the potential of a ""dynamic duo"" consisting of cryptocurrency mining and green hydrogen technology. By using clean energy sources to power blockchain mining operations and produce green hydrogen, we can not only reduce carbon emissions but also expand renewable energy capacity across the country. This approach could lead to a more sustainable energy landscape and accelerate the transition to renewable energy.

The current structure of mining blockchain-based cryptocurrency in the United States alone consumes as much carbon-based energy as the entire country of Argentina, according to a report from the White House Office of Science and Technology. The majority of crypto-mining electricity in the US relies on energy-intensive consensus mechanisms, known as ""proof of work,"" which verify crypto-assets. As per estimates from the US Energy Information Administration, cryptocurrency mining could account for 0.6% to 2.3% of all US electricity consumption in 2023.

To address the significant energy demands of cryptocurrency mining, the researchers propose an innovative technology solution. By utilizing cryptocurrencies as virtual energy carriers in conjunction with green hydrogen, we can transform the environmental challenges associated with mining into an opportunity for climate mitigation and sustainability.

The study also examines the energy strengths of individual US states to identify their potential contributions to renewable energy production. For instance, supporting cryptocurrency mining in New Mexico could generate 78.4 megawatt hours of solar power for each Bitcoin mined, while Wyoming could produce 265.8 megawatt hours of wind power for each Bitcoin mined. These numbers highlight the immense potential for renewable energy generation through cryptocurrency mining.

Cryptocurrency holds a virtual value, much like a gift card, and can also hold an energy value. By recognizing this dual function, we can further advance the sustainable future of blockchain-based cryptocurrency.

However, for this vision to become a reality, stronger federal policies for climate goals and renewable energy are needed. The researchers emphasize the importance of coupling green hydrogen with cryptocurrency to not only mitigate its own environmental impact but also pioneer a sustainable path for the transition to renewable energy.

In conclusion, the combination of cryptocurrency mining and green hydrogen technology presents an innovative and promising solution to address the environmental challenges associated with cryptocurrency operations. By leveraging clean energy sources and virtual energy carriers, we can accelerate the adoption of renewable energy and pave the way for a sustainable future. This research opens up new possibilities for collaboration between the cryptocurrency and renewable energy sectors, offering a novel strategy for combating climate change and promoting sustainability.

Fengqi You, a senior faculty fellow at the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability, and Apoorv Lal, a doctoral student, have shed light on the potential of this dynamic duo, urging policymakers and industry leaders to embrace this approach for a greener and more sustainable energy landscape.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2023/cryptocurrencies.jpg,2024-03-25 15:00:02,Innovation,Innovation
