Starting with New York and Los Angeles, the service will be available in more than a dozen cities by the end of the year. Amazon aims to provide the fastest and most convenient delivery service for prescription medications, including those for illnesses like flu and fever, as well as conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes.

To ensure quick delivery, Amazon utilizes smaller facilities closer to customers' residences instead of large warehouses. These small format stores are stocked with the most commonly used medications, allowing for faster processing times. For instance, a facility in Brooklyn holds over 12,000 medications, mostly urgent care items, and orders can be processed within minutes by pharmacists and fulfillment teams.

Delivery methods vary based on location. In more populated areas, medications may be delivered by drivers using e-bikes or electric vans, while in rural areas, drones may be employed for delivery. Each fulfillment center will have licensed pharmacists who will carefully review prescription orders. Additionally, generative AI and machine learning technologies will assist in expediting and ensuring the accuracy of order fulfillment. For example, if a handwritten prescription is received, AI will conduct fact-checking tasks to provide clear instructions to pharmacists. Amazon emphasizes that no prescription will leave a fulfillment center without proper verification by a pharmacist.

With the expansion of Amazon Pharmacy, customers in New York and Los Angeles, as well as other upcoming cities, will have access to a convenient and efficient way of receiving their prescription medications. This service not only caters to immediate healthcare needs but also offers a wide range of medications for various conditions. By utilizing smaller facilities and innovative delivery methods, Amazon aims to provide the fastest and most convenient service for customers across the United States.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/6a1d81b7d761d290e266df42ae62bc1270ca4090/2024/03/26/43c23d70-b9c3-4d5f-8ff1-bc00455b0a68/gettyimages-1229667496.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-26,Innovation,Innovation
