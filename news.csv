https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-deep-geothermal-renewable-powerhouse.html,Dig deep: US bets on geothermal to become renewable powerhouse,"Geothermal energy is emerging as a potential solution for the green transition, with businesses and the Biden administration investing in technological advancements to make it a reliable and scalable power source. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm believes that geothermal energy has the potential to surpass hydroelectric and solar power in the US by 2050. Currently, geothermal energy accounts for only 1.6% of US energy consumption in 2022.

To increase geothermal production, the US government has invested over $200 million since 2018 in an experimental site in Utah. This site focuses on Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), a technology that involves injecting water into naturally hot rocks, allowing geothermal energy to be harnessed from greater depths. Unlike traditional geothermal energy, EGS does not require a nearby hot spring or underground reservoir. This approach reduces the upfront risk associated with drilling and finding nothing, making it an attractive option for investors.

The US government is also streamlining the permitting process for geothermal projects by allowing companies to convert permits for oil or gas exploration into geothermal licenses. This reduces paperwork and delays, making it easier for companies to transition to geothermal energy. Additionally, the Energy Department states that EGS uses fewer chemical additives compared to hydraulic fracturing (fracking) and does not release hydrocarbons, addressing concerns raised by environmentalists.

Geothermal energy offers a reliable and consistent source of power, regardless of weather conditions or time of day. Unlike solar or wind power, which rely on sunlight and wind, geothermal energy provides a constant flow of energy. In terms of cost, the US government estimates that the price of geothermal energy will decrease from $70 to $100 per megawatt hour (MWh) to $45 by 2035. The use of existing drilling technology makes geothermal development quicker and more cost-effective.

The US has been a pioneer in geothermal technology, but other countries, such as France, have also begun exploring EGS sites. However, there is a potential risk of induced seismic activity associated with geothermal drilling projects, similar to fracking. The US Energy Department requires all funded projects to follow a mitigation protocol to address induced seismicity and is funding research on the issue.

In the nascent geothermal energy market, several US and Canadian start-ups have raised significant investment and are competing for a position in the industry. Companies like Fervo Energy have already connected their geothermal sites to the electric grid, attracting interest from large corporations like Google, Microsoft, and Nucor. These companies are willing to pay a premium for geothermal energy, signaling potential growth and opportunities in the market.

As the geothermal sector continues to expand, it is essential to prioritize responsible and sustainable growth. The successful development of a commercial geothermal facility will pave the way for future projects and encourage further investment in the industry. With the potential to become a clean and reliable energy source, geothermal energy has a promising future in the green transition.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/a-worker-operates-a-dr.jpg,2024-03-25 04:59:03,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/large-language-models-can-help-home-robots-recover-from-errors-without-human-help/,Large language models can help home robots recover from errors without human help,"Home robots have struggled to gain widespread success for a variety of reasons, including high pricing, impracticality, form factor issues, and mapping challenges. Even when these issues are addressed, there is still the concern of how robots handle mistakes. This is a problem that even large companies face, but they have the resources to address these problems as they arise. However, it is unrealistic to expect consumers to learn programming or hire someone to help them every time an issue occurs. Fortunately, researchers at MIT have found a solution to this problem using large language models (LLMs) in the field of robotics.

A study presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) in May focuses on bringing ""common sense"" into the process of correcting mistakes. The researchers explain that robots are excellent mimics, but unless they are specifically programmed to handle unexpected situations, they struggle to adapt and continue their tasks. Traditionally, when a robot encounters an issue, it exhausts its pre-programmed options before requiring human intervention. However, this approach is challenging in unstructured environments like homes, where even small changes can disrupt a robot's ability to function.

The study addresses the limitations of imitation learning, which is a popular method for teaching robots tasks through observation. Imitation learning struggles to account for the countless small variations in the environment that can interfere with a robot's regular operation, often requiring the robot to start from scratch. To overcome this, the researchers break demonstrations into smaller subsets rather than treating them as continuous actions.

This is where LLMs come into play. They eliminate the need for programmers to manually label and assign numerous subactions. LLMs can provide instructions for each step of a task in natural language, while a human's continuous demonstration represents those steps in physical space. The researchers wanted to connect the two so that a robot could automatically understand its current task stage and be able to replan and recover on its own.

To demonstrate this, the researchers trained a robot to scoop marbles and pour them into an empty bowl. While this is a simple task for humans, it involves various small tasks for robots. The LLMs can list and label these subtasks. During the demonstrations, the researchers purposely sabotaged the activity by bumping the robot off course and knocking marbles out of its spoon. Instead of starting from scratch, the system self-corrected the small tasks.

""With our method, when the robot is making mistakes, we don't need to ask humans to program or give extra demonstrations of how to recover from failures,"" says grad student Tsun-Hsuan Wang. This approach eliminates the need for constant human intervention and allows robots to learn from their mistakes and adjust their actions accordingly.

This research presents a promising solution for improving the functionality and adaptability of home robots. By leveraging LLMs and breaking tasks into smaller subsets, robots can better handle unexpected situations and recover from mistakes. This method not only reduces the need for constant programming and human intervention but also enhances the overall user experience with home robots.

In conclusion, the integration of large language models into home robotics offers a new approach to addressing the challenges of mistakes and adaptability. By utilizing LLMs, robots can understand and adjust their actions based on natural language instructions. This eliminates the need for constant human programming and intervention, allowing robots to learn from their mistakes and recover without starting from scratch. With further advancements in this field, home robots have the potential to become more practical, reliable, and user-friendly, making them a valuable addition to households worldwide.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/CommonSense-01-press_0.jpg?w=900,2024-03-25 20:01:06,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-large-language-simple-mechanism-knowledge.html,Large language models use a surprisingly simple mechanism to retrieve some stored knowledge,"Large language models (LLMs), such as the ones that power popular AI chatbots like ChatGPT, are incredibly complex. Despite their extensive use in various fields, including customer support, code generation, and language translation, scientists still have limited understanding of their inner workings.

To gain more insight into these models, researchers from MIT and other institutions conducted a study on how these massive machine-learning models retrieve stored knowledge. Their findings revealed a surprising discovery: LLMs often employ a simple linear function to decode and retrieve facts. Furthermore, the same decoding function is used for similar types of facts. Linear functions, which consist of two variables and no exponents, capture the direct relationship between these variables.

The researchers demonstrated that by identifying linear functions for different facts, they can examine what the model knows about new subjects and where it stores that knowledge. Using a technique they developed to estimate these simple functions, the researchers found that even when a model provides an incorrect answer, it often retains the correct information. This approach could potentially be used in the future to detect and rectify falsehoods within the model, thus reducing the likelihood of incorrect or nonsensical responses.

Evan Hernandez, an electrical engineering and computer science (EECS) graduate student and co-lead author of the paper detailing these findings, stated, ""Even though these models are really complicated, nonlinear functions that are trained on lots of data and are very hard to understand, there are sometimes really simple mechanisms working inside them. This is one instance of that.""

The paper was written by Hernandez and co-lead author Arnab Sharma, a computer science graduate student at Northeastern University, along with their advisor Jacob Andreas, an associate professor in EECS and a member of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). The team also included senior author David Bau, an assistant professor of computer science at Northeastern, as well as researchers from MIT, Harvard University, and the Israeli Institute of Technology. The research will be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024) in Vienna from May 7 to 11.

Most large language models, also known as transformer models, are neural networks that consist of billions of interconnected nodes or neurons. These nodes are organized into multiple layers and are responsible for encoding and processing data, loosely resembling the structure of the human brain.

A significant portion of the knowledge stored in a transformer model can be represented as relations that connect subjects and objects. For example, the relation ""Miles Davis plays the trumpet"" connects the subject (Miles Davis) to the object (trumpet). As the transformer acquires more knowledge, it stores additional facts related to a specific subject across multiple layers. When a user asks about that subject, the model must retrieve and decode the most relevant fact to provide an accurate response.

The researchers aimed to understand the mechanism employed by the model to retrieve these facts. They conducted a series of experiments on LLMs and discovered that despite their complexity, these models utilize a simple linear function to decode relational information. Each decoding function is specific to the type of fact being retrieved. For example, the model would use one decoding function to output the instrument played by a person and another function to output the state where a person was born.

To estimate these simple functions, the researchers developed a method and computed functions for 47 different relations, such as ""capital city of a country"" and ""lead singer of a band."" Although there are countless possible relations, the researchers focused on this subset as they are representative of the types of facts that can be expressed in this manner.

To test each function, the researchers changed the subject and checked if the correct object information could still be retrieved.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/large-language-models-2.jpg,2024-03-25 09:34:06,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/25/99-is-not-total-the-worst-places-to-watch-the-solar-eclipse/,99% Is Not Total: The Worst Places To Watch The Solar Eclipse,"Cincinnati and Columbus, Ohio are not in the path of totality for the upcoming solar eclipse on April 8. It's important to double-check the location of any eclipse-observing events because many organizers either lack the knowledge or transparency to explicitly state whether guests will witness a total solar eclipse or not. Unfortunately, there are numerous events across North America that use phrases like ""partial totality"" or ""99% total eclipse"" to promote events that are outside the path. However, the truth is that you're either in the path of totality or you're not. If you're on the wrong side of the moon's shadow, you'll only experience a partial solar eclipse.

To ensure you have the best experience, it's crucial to find a location within the 115-mile wide path of totality. This path will touch parts of 15 U.S. states on April 8. Anything outside this path will not provide the awe-inspiring sight of the sun's corona and the darkness that accompanies a total solar eclipse. Instead, it will be just a partial solar eclipse, which occurred in North America on October 14, 2023, and June 10, 2021.

Let's take a look at some organized eclipse-observing events and packages that you should avoid on April 8, along with alternative suggestions for experiencing totality:

1. COSI, Columbus, Ohio
COSI's Eclipse Experience in downtown Columbus, Ohio, will only offer a partial solar eclipse. This event is located outside the path of totality, and it's puzzling why they are hosting an event when a total solar eclipse is accessible in the northwestern suburbs of Columbus. To truly witness totality, head northwest to places like Dublin (1 minute 23 seconds) or Marion (3 minutes 34 seconds), according to Eclipse2024.org.

2. Science Central, Fort Wayne, Indiana
Although Science Central in Fort Wayne, Indiana proudly claims to be ""near the path of totality,"" it falls short as it will only experience a 99.89% partial solar eclipse. Their programming for the day may provide information about different types of eclipses and safe viewing methods, but it won't answer the question of why they brought you there. To witness totality, drive 70 miles southeast to Wapakoneta, Neil Armstrong's hometown, where you can enjoy 3 minutes and 57 seconds of totality at the Armstrong Air & Space Museum.

3. Total Eclipse Party at Edgewater Sport Park, Cincinnati, Ohio
Downtown Cincinnati, Ohio, is not within the path of totality for the solar eclipse. However, if you travel to the city's far western suburbs, you may catch a glimpse of totality. Unfortunately, Edgewater Sports Park, located 25 miles west of downtown, is not far enough to experience the full effects of a total solar eclipse. Despite its name, the Total Eclipse Party will only offer a 99.998% partial solar eclipse. For a truly enchanting experience, drive just nine miles northeast to Miami Whitewater Forest, where a free event will allow you to witness 1 minute and 14 seconds of totality.

4. The Alamo and River Walk, San Antonio
San Antonio, like Columbus, will be divided by the path of totality, with only the northwest part experiencing totality. Visit San Antonio advises visitors to escape the city center, but their ""Best events for viewing the eclipse in San Antonio"" page is confusing and includes events that won't witness a total solar eclipse, such as Solar Eclipse at the Alamo and The Moon's Daughters. It's best to avoid the River Walk and the Alamo on April 8. Instead, head to the northwest/La Cantera suburbs of San Antonio or further west into the Hill Country for a better chance of witnessing totality.

5. Hotel Ithaca, Ithaca, New York
Hotel Ithaca in Ithaca, New York, offers a ""Solar Eclipse Package"" that includes two nights and an ""Eclipse Cocktail Party."" However, guests will be disappointed to realize that they could have traveled just 20 minutes north to experience the awe-inspiring sight of a total solar eclipse. The hotel claims to provide the full visual effects of the event, but it can only offer a ""99% Magnitude"" eclipse. For a truly remarkable experience, head north to witness the full splendor of totality.

It's essential to be well-informed and choose a location within the path of totality to fully appreciate the rare and breathtaking event of a total solar eclipse. Don't be misled by events that claim to offer partial totality or a high percentage of a total eclipse. Make the effort to find a suitable location and enjoy the unforgettable experience of witnessing a total solar eclipse firsthand.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6601750b9a60bff58d97df68/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3777,2126,x0,y395,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 19:00:13,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/fisker-trading-suspended-by-nyse/,Fisker trading suspended by NYSE,"The New York Stock Exchange made an announcement on Monday stating that it will be suspending the trading of shares for electric vehicle (EV) startup Fisker and is taking steps to remove the company from its stock exchange. The exchange explained that Fisker's stock is ""no longer suitable for listing"" due to its ""abnormally low"" price levels. This decision follows a warning from the NYSE to Fisker last month, informing them that their stock price had been trading below $1 for 30 consecutive days, which violated the exchange's rules.

Fisker does have the option to review the NYSE's determination, but the company stated in a filing on Monday afternoon that it expects its stock to be transferred to an over-the-counter market, such as OTC Pink. The delisting has also triggered repayment clauses in two loans that Fisker currently cannot afford to repay, potentially having a significant negative impact on the business.

This suspension marks the end of a tumultuous day for Fisker, as its shares fell more than 28% before trading was halted. Earlier in the day, Fisker announced that it had lost a potential deal with a major automaker, rumored to be Nissan. This development has also put at risk a recently announced attempt to secure emergency funding.

Fisker did not provide an explanation as to why the automaker terminated the negotiations, which was a crucial condition for the closing of a potential $150 million convertible note that was announced just last week. In the filing, Fisker mentioned that it will be requesting the unnamed investor to waive this closing condition.

Fisker has been facing escalating problems for several months, including customer complaints, lawsuits, and federal investigations. The struggling EV startup has been experiencing difficulties in selling its Ocean SUV, failing to meet its own sales goals, as reported by TechCrunch in January. In an attempt to boost sales, Fisker shifted away from a direct sales model and began relying on dealerships. However, the company has also been grappling with quality issues, which it has struggled to address, according to internal documents.

In February, Fisker laid off around 15% of its workforce (approximately 200 employees) and last week reported having only $121 million in cash reserves. The company has halted production and has warned investors that without a fresh influx of cash, it may not survive another year.

Note: This article has been updated to include additional details from Fisker's SEC filing on Monday afternoon.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fisker-GettyImages.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-25 21:06:18,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/maju-kuruvilla-is-out-as-ceo-of-one-click-checkout-company-bolt/,Maju Kuruvilla is out as CEO of one-click checkout company Bolt,"Bolt, the one-click checkout company, has undergone a change in leadership. Maju Kuruvilla, the former CEO, has been replaced by Justin Grooms, who previously served as Bolt's global head of sales. Grooms is now the interim CEO, as stated on his LinkedIn profile. While Kuruvilla didn't provide much information about the change, he confirmed it on LinkedIn and X, sharing a post that simply said, ""One-Click Checkedout from @bolt! Onwards"" with a rocket emoji. Arjun Sethi, a co-founder of Tribe Capital, commented on Kuruvilla's post, expressing his admiration for the executive.

According to The Information, the Bolt board voted to remove Kuruvilla over the weekend. Kuruvilla, a former executive at Amazon, took on the role of CEO in January 2022 after the founder, Ryan Breslow, stepped down.

Grooms has been with Bolt for five years and has held executive positions at various companies, including Ultraleap (formerly Leap Motion), Datron World Communications, and Qualcomm. The company stated that the CEO role had changed and described Kuruvilla's departure as ""amicable,"" but no further details were provided.

Bolt has faced its fair share of controversy. Breslow, the company's founder, started the company after dropping out of Stanford and was known for his outspoken rants. The company attracted attention when it became the subject of a federal probe regarding potential violations of securities laws during a fundraising round in 2021. Bolt was seeking a $355 million Series E round, which valued the company at $11 billion. In total, the company raised around $1 billion in venture-backed funding.

Bolt also experienced several rounds of layoffs, including one in May 2022 that saw 185 employees, or one-third of its workforce, being let go. Additional layoffs occurred in early 2023 and December 2023, affecting 29% of the staff.

In October, Kuruvilla stated in an interview with TechCrunch that the SEC was no longer investigating Bolt. He also mentioned that the company was working towards profitability and had plans to introduce new features, such as improving merchandise returns and providing personalized experiences for its universal shopper network. Bolt announced partnerships with retailers like Saks OFF 5TH, Shinola, Filson, Lafayette 148, and Toys ""R"" Us in November.

Recently, Bolt entered into a deal with Checkout.com, becoming Checkout.com's exclusive one-click checkout provider. In return, Checkout.com became Bolt's preferred payment partner.

With the recent deal with Checkout.com, Bolt aims to strengthen its position as a leading one-click checkout provider.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Headshot_Maju-Kuruvilla_CEO-of-Bolt-1.jpg?resize=1200,813",2024-03-25 21:15:07,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/elon-musk-x-ccdh-california-lawsuit-dismissed/,A judge just killed Elon Musk's lawsuit against an anti-hate research org,"A federal judge has ruled against Elon Musk and his company X in a lawsuit against the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH). X had sued the nonprofit organization last year, accusing it of spreading misleading claims about hate and extremism on their platform. They claimed to have lost millions of dollars as a result of CCDH's research. Musk also accused CCDH of illegally scraping data and breaking platform rules.

In response to X's claims, CCDH filed a motion to strike under California's law against Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (SLAPP), which aims to prevent frivolous lawsuits that intimidate others. CCDH CEO Imran Ahmed accused Musk of intentionally prolonging the legal process to increase the organization's legal costs. United States district judge Charles R. Breyer granted CCDH's motion to dismiss the case and denied Musk and X the opportunity to relitigate.

Judge Breyer stated that it was clear X's purpose in bringing the case was to punish CCDH for criticizing them and to discourage others from doing the same. He emphasized the importance of free speech and the right to criticize, even for organizations like CCDH.

The CCDH has been researching trends in hate speech, extremism, and misinformation on major social networks since its formation in 2018. Their research examines disturbing content across platforms such as TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram. By shedding light on these issues, they aim to hold social media companies accountable for their decisions and protect fundamental human rights and civil liberties.

CCDH's legal team, led by Roberta Kaplan, celebrated the judge's decision and emphasized that even the wealthiest individuals cannot bend the rule of law to their will. Kaplan recently achieved a major win in the E. Jean Carroll defamation suit against former president Donald Trump.

While CCDH's victory in California is significant for researchers tracking online extremism, Musk is pursuing a similar lawsuit against the left-leaning media watchdog Media Matters for America. However, this lawsuit is taking place in Texas, which lacks the same protections against frivolous lawsuits aimed at stifling free speech as California.

Overall, this ruling reaffirms the importance of free speech and the right to criticize, even for organizations like CCDH. It sets a precedent that even prominent individuals like Elon Musk cannot use their wealth to manipulate the legal system. Researchers and advocates for free speech can take solace in this victory against frivolous lawsuits and the protection of fundamental human rights.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/twitter-x-logo-musk-pattern.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-25 20:33:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/profluent-spurred-by-salesforce-research-and-backed-by-jeff-dean-uses-ai-to-discover-medicines/,"Profluent, spurred by Salesforce research and backed by Jeff Dean, uses AI to discover medicines","In a groundbreaking research project called ProGen, Salesforce utilized generative AI to design proteins. The aim was to develop a more cost-effective method for discovering medical treatments compared to traditional approaches. While the project initially didn't yield significant commercial results, one of the researchers involved, Ali Madani, has now launched a company called Profluent. Profluent aims to bring protein-generating technology out of the lab and into the hands of pharmaceutical companies, with a mission to reverse the drug development paradigm. Madani and his co-founder, Alexander Meeske, plan to use generative AI and gene editing to create custom-fit treatments for patients.

During his time at Salesforce, Madani noticed similarities between the ""language"" of proteins and natural language such as English. He discovered that proteins could be treated like words in a paragraph and used generative AI to predict new proteins with novel functions. With Profluent, Madani and Meeske want to take this concept further by applying it to gene editing. They believe that many genetic diseases cannot be cured by proteins or enzymes derived directly from nature. By optimizing multiple attributes simultaneously, Profluent aims to create custom-designed gene editors that are tailored to individual patients.

Profluent's approach is not without precedent. Other companies and research groups have demonstrated the potential of generative AI in predicting proteins. Nvidia released a generative AI model called MegaMolBART, which can search for potential drug targets and forecast chemical reactions. Meta trained a model called ESM-2 on protein sequences, allowing them to predict sequences for over 600 million proteins in just two weeks. Google's AI research lab, DeepMind, developed AlphaFold, a system that accurately predicts complete protein structures.

Profluent is training AI models on massive data sets, including over 40 billion protein sequences, to create new gene-editing and protein-producing systems. Rather than developing treatments themselves, the company plans to collaborate with external partners to produce genetic medicines with the most promising paths to approval. Madani believes that this approach could significantly reduce the time and capital required to develop new treatments. The average time to develop a new medicine is currently 10-15 years, with costs ranging from several hundred million to $2.8 billion.

Profluent, based in Berkeley, has received backing from notable venture capital firms such as Spark Capital, Insight Partners, and Air Street Capital. Google's chief scientist, Jeff Dean, has also contributed to the platform. The company's immediate focus is on upgrading its AI models by expanding training data sets, as well as acquiring customers and partners. Profluent faces competition from other companies, including EvolutionaryScale and Basecamp Research, who are also developing protein-generating models with substantial financial support.

Madani emphasizes that Profluent has already made scientific breakthroughs in gene editing and now aims to scale its platform and collaborate with partners to achieve its ambitious goals for the future. By intentionally designing solutions in biology, Profluent hopes to move away from accidental discoveries and provide humanity with the treatments it urgently needs.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1288172035.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-25 22:08:51,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-favorite-linux-text-editors-and-why-you-should-be-using-one/,My favorite Linux text editors (and why you should be using one),"Linux has a long history of text editors, with the infamous editor wars between emacs and vi causing heated debates among users. However, the role of text editors has evolved over time. While they were once primarily used for configuring Linux or writing code, they now serve a much broader range of purposes. In addition to their traditional uses, text editors are now commonly used for note-taking, journaling, and even writing novels. Although I have personally never used a text editor to write a full-length book, I have found them to be invaluable for writing short stories and flash fiction.

Before I proceed, let me clarify that the purpose of this article is not to discuss emacs or vi. While both editors are undeniably powerful, they may not be suitable for everyday use or for the average user. Instead, I will focus on text editors that are easier to use but still effective for a wide range of tasks.

One text editor that has been my go-to for decades is nano. It may be basic, but it gets the job done. Nano includes all the essential features I need in an editor, without overwhelming me with unnecessary complexity. With nano, you can write simple flat text files without any formatting. It offers features such as interactive search-and-replace, undo/redo, syntax coloring, smooth scrolling, auto-indentation, go-to-line-and-column-number, feature toggles, file locking, and internationalization support.

It's important to note that nano is a terminal application, which means it does not have a graphical user interface. To use nano, you simply open the terminal and issue the command ""nano filename"" (replace ""filename"" with the name of the file you want to edit or create). There are several options you can use with nano, such as ""--backup"" to create a backup of the previous version of the file, ""--tabstospaces"" to convert typed tabs to spaces, ""--locking"" to lock the file when editing, ""--smooth"" for smooth scrolling, and many more. Nano is free and comes pre-installed with most Linux distributions.

Another text editor worth mentioning is Gedit, which is the default text editor for the GNOME desktop environment. Gedit is a basic but effective graphical application with a user-friendly interface. It offers features such as tabs, support for internationalized text (UTF-8), syntax highlighting, markdown support, configurable fonts and colors, print support, auto-save, auto backup, keyboard shortcuts, theming, and full-screen mode.

What sells me on Gedit is its simplicity. While I usually default to nano, there are times when I need a graphical user interface, and Gedit is my go-to choice. Furthermore, Gedit can be used in fullscreen mode, which allows me to edit text files without any distractions. Gedit is free and comes pre-installed with most GNOME-based desktop distributions.

If you're looking for a text editor with a more modern touch, COSMIC Text Editor is worth considering. It will be the default text editor for System76's COSMIC desktop, which will be released in the near future. Although COSMIC Text Editor is still under development, it already shows great promise. It offers features such as syntax highlighting, standard keyboard shortcuts, find and spellcheck functionality, project support, revert changes, document statistics, and even Git management support.

One feature that sets COSMIC Text Editor apart is its dark theme, which adds a touch of elegance. Like Gedit, COSMIC Text Editor is simple to use and can handle both basic tasks and more complex ones, such as writing code. If you use Pop!_OS, you can get a preview of COSMIC Text Editor by installing it from the Pop Shop. COSMIC Text Editor will be free and officially available when the COSMIC Desktop OS is released.

Lastly, let's not forget about Kate, which is the text editor for the KDE Plasma desktop environment. Kate offers a few more features compared to Gedit, such as multi-cursor and multi-cursor selection, which allow you to select and manipulate multiple strings of text simultaneously.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-method-quantum-mechanics-lithium-metal.html,New method that uses quantum mechanics can lead to improved lithium metal batteries,"In a recent study published in Nature Energy, Dr. Perla Balbuena and Dr. Jorge Seminario, professors in the Artie McFerrin Department of Chemical Engineering at Texas A&M University, introduced a new approach to understanding the impact of external pressure on lithium-metal batteries using quantum mechanics. By gaining a deeper understanding of the behavior of lithium ions under pressure, this research aims to improve the fabrication processes of lithium-metal batteries, leading to the development of more efficient and longer-lasting battery technologies.

The researchers emphasized the significance of their work, stating that it demonstrates the impact of first-principles ab initio analysis on the design of macroscopic processes. The methodologies used in this study can be applied to the development of improved chemical and physical processes, benefiting various fields such as chemical engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, materials science, and biology.

This research is part of the ongoing efforts of the Battery500 Consortium, a collaboration between national labs and academia focused on developing more reliable and high-performing vehicle batteries. Led by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, the consortium aims to achieve the goals set out by the Department of Energy.

Lithium-ion batteries have revolutionized the world of mobile electronics, enabling the development of compact devices that can easily fit in our pockets. However, these batteries still face several challenges, with one of the most significant being their limited energy density, primarily due to the constraints of their components.

Dr. Seminario explains that lithium-ion batteries work by relying on two essential electrodes to convert lithium ions into neutral species, storing their energy as chemical energy. The batteries then transform these neutral species back into ions, allowing the transport of their energy as electrical energy. The anode, or the negative electrode, is where the lithium ions possess maximum energy, while the cathode, or the positive electrode, is where the energy of the lithium ions is at its minimum. This energy difference drives the spontaneous migration of lithium ions from the anode to the cathode during discharge, facilitating the flow of electrons and powering external devices.

To overcome the limitations of current lithium-ion batteries, researchers have been exploring alternative materials, particularly replacing the conventional graphite anode with lithium metal. Theoretically, this substitution has the potential to increase the energy density of the anode by a factor of ten.

However, lithium metal is highly reactive, requiring innovative control measures such as applying external pressure to the battery. While the impact of external pressure on cell performance is well-known, there are no reports investigating its relationship with the electroplating of lithium in large-format pouch cells to enhance overall battery performance. Additionally, during the assembly and cycling of the battery, its components may experience volume changes, leading to cell swelling and affecting battery performance and cycle life.

The focus of this research was to understand why pressure can lead to a more uniform distribution of lithium ions on the anode, preventing the formation of dendrites, which are tiny needle-like structures that could potentially cause short-circuits in the battery. Using theoretical-computational techniques, the Texas A&M team analyzed the precise effects of pressure on lithium-metal anodes.

Dr. Balbuena explains that they employed quantum mechanical analysis to evaluate the trajectories of lithium ions migrating from the cathode to the anode. By understanding the trajectories of the lithium ions and how they are affected by the pressure, the researchers were able to predict the subsequent electrodepositions on the anode surface.

The key finding of this research is that lithium ions tend to detour towards regions with higher pressure or a higher concentration of lithium atoms on the surface. This behavior is a result of the electric field generated by the lithium-metal anode.

This discovery has significant implications as it allows researchers to predict the behavior of novel materials proposed for cutting-edge applications. By understanding the behavior of ions under these conditions, it becomes possible to develop lithium-metal batteries using less expensive infrastructure and fabrication processes, while also achieving longer battery life and increased functionality.

These findings contribute to the ongoing efforts in improving lithium-metal battery technologies. With further advancements in understanding the impact of external pressure on battery performance, we can expect to see significant improvements in the energy density, efficiency, and overall reliability of lithium-metal batteries, leading to a more sustainable and innovative future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/new-discovery-can-lead.jpg,2024-03-25 17:06:08,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/gostudent-tutoring-profitability/,"GoStudent, the online learning platform, says it's now profitable","GoStudent, the online tutoring marketplace based in Vienna, Austria, has established itself as one of the largest and most popular startups in the country. With 11 million families and 23,000 tutors on its platform, GoStudent is now also profitable. CEO Felix Ohswald stated that the company is not only EBITDA profitable but also has positive operating cash flow.

GoStudent has become one of the few Austrian startups to gain international recognition, alongside Bitpanda and Runtastic. However, achieving profitability was not an easy journey. Like many other technology companies, GoStudent faced challenges during the market crash caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The company lost €89 million in 2021 and €220 million in 2022, leading to layoffs and cost-cutting measures.

Ohswald described this period as a phase of ""crazy"" hyperscaling, with rapid growth but also significant cash burn. Despite raising hundreds of millions of euros in funding, GoStudent realized that it needed to change its approach. In 2023, the company reduced its burn rate by 70%, but more adjustments were necessary. In January of this year, Ohswald announced another round of layoffs, marking the third round since 2022.

While the company faced tough moments, it also learned valuable lessons. GoStudent understood the need to continue growing while spending less. It made cuts in non-essential areas such as parties and acquisitions. It also decided to focus on established markets for online tutoring, particularly in Europe, rather than expanding to new regions where it would face more competition.

GoStudent's success is attributed to the surge in demand for online learning during the pandemic. The company went from having to convince parents of the benefits of online tutoring to becoming the go-to solution for educational support for schoolchildren. However, the company still needed to address its cash burn issue.

To achieve profitability, GoStudent had to strike a balance between growth and cost reduction. While the company's mission is to become the leading global school, it also understands the importance of personalized tutoring. GoStudent acquired Studienkreis in 2022, a company with physical learning centers, to enhance its hybrid learning approach. By leveraging technology, GoStudent aims to connect students with the right tutors regardless of location.

Most of GoStudent's tutors are university students, which helps them connect with and understand their pupils better. This younger demographic contributes to the success of the tutoring platform.

In conclusion, GoStudent has overcome financial challenges and achieved profitability. By making strategic adjustments and focusing on its core business, the company has managed to stabilize its operations. GoStudent's success in the online tutoring market is a testament to the increasing demand for remote learning solutions. With its hybrid approach and commitment to personalized tutoring, GoStudent is well-positioned for further growth in the education technology sector.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Founders-of-GoStudent-Gregor-Muller-I-Felix-Ohswald-2.jpg?w=1024,2024-03-25 11:00:36,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/london-regtech-gss-raises-47m-to-help-banks-screen-for-global-sanctions/,London regtech GSS raises $47M to help banks screen for global sanctions,"London-based regulatory compliance platform, Global Screening Services (GSS), has recently raised $47 million in funding. The increase in economic sanctions, particularly from the U.S. against countries like Russia, China, and Iran, has driven the demand for GSS's services.

GSS was initially incubated within consulting firm AlixPartners before becoming an independent company in 2021. The CEO, Tom Scampion, previously served as the head of financial crime for Deloitte's EMEA arm before joining AlixPartners. GSS had previously raised a similar amount of funding last year, with investments from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and other major banks. The latest funding round includes backing from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Cynosure Group, and AlixPartners.

Banks often face challenges in enforcing sanctions due to their role in global money flow. In 2019, Standard Chartered was fined $1.1 billion for inadequate money-laundering controls and breaching sanctions against countries like Iran. Similarly, BNP Paribas was fined $8.9 billion in 2014 for processing transactions for U.S.-sanctioned countries.

To address these challenges, investors have been supporting regulatory compliance businesses, like GSS. Last year, New York-based Droit raised $23 million, and London's SteelEye secured $21 million in financing.

GSS offers a sanctions-screening platform to help banks and financial institutions comply with regulations. The platform allows institutions to input transaction data, which is then screened against a comprehensive set of sanctions lists from around the world. GSS also enhances these lists with additional data points, such as dates of birth, International Maritime Organization numbers, and data from the financial transfer systems of sanctioned countries.

In addition to standard lists, GSS provides ""enhanced"" lists that include companies partially owned by individuals, companies, or governments that have been sanctioned by authorities like the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the European Union (EU), or the United Kingdom (U.K).

With the recent funding, GSS is transitioning from the development phase to full operational capacity. The company is preparing to go live with its first customers, marking an important milestone in its journey to support financial institutions in meeting their global sanctions obligations.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1770041999-e1711386339681.jpg?resize=1200,677",2024-03-25 18:36:37,Innovation,Innovation

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-high-efficiency-based-copperiodide-clusters.html,A high efficiency LED based on copper-iodide clusters,"A team of researchers led by Prof. Yao Hongbin from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) has made a significant breakthrough in the development of light-emitting diodes (LEDs). They have successfully created a high efficiency, high brightness warm white LED using copper-iodide cluster hybrids. This groundbreaking research has been published in Nature Photonics.

LED technology has long been considered the future of large-area solid-state lighting due to its simple manufacturing process and high operability. Various types of solution-processed LED devices, such as those based on lead-halide perovskites, organic semiconductor materials, and colloidal core-shell quantum dots (QDs), have already achieved impressive electroluminescence performance.

However, the use of materials containing heavy metals like lead-halide perovskites and CdSe QDs has raised serious environmental concerns. On the other hand, LED devices based on organic light-emitting molecules, InP QDs, and ZnSe QDs have high production costs due to complex synthesis methods. Therefore, developing solution-processed LEDs that are low-cost, low-toxicity, easily scalable, and highly efficient has become a crucial challenge for the future of solid-state lighting.

To address this challenge, Prof. Yao's team focused on designing and preparing a copper-iodine-based hybrid cluster with a broad photoluminescence spectrum. They achieved this by introducing nitrogen-phosphine chelating ligands and phosphine-containing solubilizing ligands. The resulting copper-iodide hybrid clusters exhibited both high luminescence efficiency and high solubility, making them suitable for LED production.

The team fabricated luminescent thin films using the hybrid clusters through a spin-coating method. These films demonstrated a low surface roughness of 0.22 nm and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of over 70%. They proved to be an excellent luminescent layer for creating low-cost warm-white LED devices using an orthogonal solvent route.

The LED devices developed by the team achieved remarkable performance. They attained a maximum external quantum efficiency of 19.1% and a brightness exceeding 40,000 cd m-2. Furthermore, the operational lifetime of these devices exceeded 232 hours (T50 @100 cd m-2). The team also successfully constructed a large-area solution-processed LED device with a working area of 36 cm2 using blade-coating. This device emitted warm white light with a brightness close to 60,000 cd m-2.

Moreover, by modifying the nitrogen heterocycles of the nitrogen-phosphine chelating ligands with different electron-donating groups, the team was able to develop a series of solution-processed LED devices with color tunability.

The research conducted by Prof. Yao's team has demonstrated the feasibility of achieving high-efficiency, high-brightness LED devices using copper-iodide hybrid clusters. The structural expandability and spectral tunability of these clusters make them highly promising for fabricating low-cost, high-performance LED panels and solid-state lighting.

This groundbreaking work opens up new possibilities in the field of LED technology and brings us closer to realizing the full potential of energy-efficient lighting solutions. With further advancements and optimizations, solution-processed LEDs based on copper-iodide hybrid clusters may soon become a commercial reality, revolutionizing the lighting industry and contributing to a more sustainable future.
