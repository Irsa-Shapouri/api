A total solar eclipse is a captivating event that requires careful timing and preparation. First and foremost, you must position yourself within the path of totality, which is a narrow strip spanning only 115 miles. Secondly, you must ensure that you are in a location with a clear sky. Lastly, you need to know when to remove your eclipse glasses to witness the awe-inspiring sight of the sun's majestic corona.

While these steps may seem daunting to some, it is the act of removing the eclipse glasses that often leads to panic among potential eclipse chasers. However, the answer is quite simple. You remove your eclipse glasses when it gets dark. If you find yourself within the path of totality, the sudden darkness will be unmistakable as the moon's shadow sweeps over you. It will be a moment you cannot miss. On the other hand, if you are not within the path of totality, it will not get dark, and you should continue to use your glasses.

Nevertheless, there are now smartphone apps available that provide an immersive audio experience, guiding users on when to remove their solar eclipse glasses as totality begins. These apps also offer instructions on observing other phenomena such as shadow bands, Baily's beads, and the diamond ring effect. They can enhance your eclipse-viewing experience. To fully enjoy these apps, it is recommended to use over-the-ear bone conduction earphones instead of earbuds that may block out the sounds around you.

Let's explore some of the top apps that can assist you during a solar eclipse:

1. The Eclipse Company (Platforms: iOS and Android)
   - Cost: Pro version available at an additional cost (to be confirmed)
   - This app offers real-time weather updates, cloud forecasts for totality, a countdown timer with a vibration alert to safely remove solar eclipse glasses, and detailed information about local eclipse events. It also provides alerts for observing eclipse phenomena, creating an immersive audio experience. However, it remains silent during totality.

2. Solar Eclipse Timer App (Platforms: iOS and Android)
   - Cost: $1.99 per eclipse
   - Developed by eclipse chaser and educator Gordon Telepun, this app utilizes geolocation to confirm your position within or outside the path of totality. It guides you through the contact times and provides instructions for observing various eclipse phenomena. It even includes a ""Photographer's Mode"" developed in collaboration with ex-NASA eclipse calculator and photographer Fred Espenak, known as ""Mr. Eclipse,"" making it an excellent choice for photographers.

3. One Eclipse (Platform: iOS only)
   - Cost: $1.99
   - Created by the non-profit organization Astronomers Without Borders and Simulation Curriculum, OneEclipse supports a glasses recycling program for underserved communities worldwide. In addition to allowing you to simulate the eclipse from your location or anywhere on Earth, it features an interactive map with precise eclipse event times and a dynamic Eclipse Countdown clock. It also includes a simple audio timer for each phase of the eclipse.

These apps not only enhance your eclipse experience, but they also contribute to important causes such as recycling eclipse glasses and supporting underserved communities.

Are you ready to put your word association skills to the test? In this game, you'll be presented with a grid of 16 words and your goal is to arrange them into four groups of four by figuring out the links between them. Each group is color-coded, with yellow being the easiest and purple being the most challenging. Let's dive in!

Before we begin, let me introduce today's words: PACE, CLIPPER, MOVE, MEDICINE, FASTER, PROMPTER, ROCKET, SPEED, GO, SPUR, COMMUTE, HURRY, RATE, VISION, CLIP, and PACER.

Now, let's move on to the hints for each group:

Yellow group - This group is all about something's swiftness.
Green group - These words encourage you to speed up!
Blue group - Think NBA team player when trying to solve this group.
Purple group - These words are linked by a term meaning ""over a long distance.""

Now that you have the hints, let's reveal the Connections groups:

Yellow group - This group consists of CLIP, PACE, RATE, and SPEED. Can you guess why they belong together?
Green group - FASTER, GO, HURRY, and MOVE make up this group. What's the common theme?
Blue group - CLIPPER, PACER, ROCKET, and SPUR are the words in this group. Can you figure out why?
Purple group - This group is made up of COMMUTE, MEDICINE, PROMPTER, and VISION. Can you find the connection?

Now it's time for the big reveal! The answers for today's Connections are:

Yellow group - These words are all related to how fast something is going.
Green group - These words all encourage action or moving quickly.
Blue group - These words are all NBA team players.
Purple group - All words in this group are linked by the term ""tele____.""

Unfortunately, there was no perfect game today, but my streak is now up to five games in a row!

I quickly figured out the blue group, although I suspected it might be a red herring. The green and yellow groups were intriguing because they seemed like different versions of the same concept. I made a mistake by including COMMUTE with the green group instead of FASTER, but once I corrected that, I focused on solving the purples for victory.

That's it for today's Connections clues and answers. If you need hints or the solution for Tuesday's game, make sure to check out my blog. Before I sign off, here's a quick life tip for you: treat yourself to a meal at the best restaurant in your area at least once. Save up if you need to, because the experience will be worth it.

Wordle Analysis

After attempting today's Wordle, I eagerly checked my progress using Wordle Bot. It's always interesting to see how my guesses stack up against the possibilities.

Competitive Wordle Score

Unfortunately, today's Wordle didn't result in any points for me. It's a zero. But hey, that's the beauty of the game – not every day will be a triumph, and that's what keeps us coming back for more.

The Etymology of ""Sally""

Let's take a moment to explore the fascinating etymology of the word ""sally"" in the context of today's Wordle. In its non-proper noun form, ""sally"" refers to the act of suddenly rushing forth or making a sudden attack from a defensive position. It can also mean embarking on a journey or a new venture.

The word ""sally"" traces its roots back through several languages before finding its way into English. Its journey begins with the Middle French word ""sallie,"" which is the noun form of ""sallir,"" meaning ""to rush out, leap forth."" ""Sallir"" itself has origins in the Latin word ""salire,"" which means ""to leap."" This Latin root has given rise to related English words such as ""salient"" (prominently projecting) and ""assail"" (to attack). These words reflect the concept of movement or leaping forth.

In essence, the etymology of ""sally"" captures the essence of suddenness and unexpectedness, whether in a physical attack from a fortified position or when embarking on a new journey or venture.
