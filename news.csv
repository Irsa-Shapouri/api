The specific financial details of the deal have not been disclosed. This acquisition signifies Borderless Capital's first acquisition since its establishment in 2018.

By acquiring CTF Capital, Borderless Capital will gain expertise in AI-infused quant trading, enhancing its existing business operations. Additionally, this move marks the firm's expansion into Latin America, as it plans to open a new office in Argentina in the second quarter of this year. Argentina is renowned as a leading hub for technology innovation in web3.

CTF Capital has developed trading models and capabilities that leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) strategy engines. They have also pioneered automated market making (AMM), a decentralized exchange that employs algorithms to trade digital assets. Moreover, CTF Capital has expertise in maximal extractable value (MEV) strategies, which enable block miners to profit from transaction order manipulation in decentralized finance. In the rapidly evolving web3 landscape, where tokens and blockchains can experience rapid fluctuations, the ability to trade swiftly is crucial for any investment firm focusing on cryptocurrencies.

Following the merger with CTF Capital, Borderless Capital's assets under management (AUM) will exceed $500 million. Borderless Capital currently manages six funds, including a $50 million cross-chain fund and the Algorand Fund. All the existing funds managed by CTF Capital will be integrated into Borderless' Multi-Strategy Fund V LP, which was launched last year and currently manages $100 million in assets. The multi-strategy fund serves as an open-ended hedge fund that aims to generate risk-adjusted maximum returns for investors in both liquid and soon-to-be-liquid digital assets.

As part of the acquisition, CTF Capital's entire team, consisting of 11 staff members, including two partners, will join Borderless Capital. This addition will expand Borderless' total team size to nearly 40 employees.

David Garcia, co-founder and managing partner at Borderless Capital, highlighted CTF Capital's technological expertise, particularly in developing their machine learning and AI-powered blockchain investment platform. The team at CTF Capital has dedicated over three years to this endeavor and has also explored emerging opportunities in on-chain markets, such as participating in the MEV.

From a financial perspective, Borderless Capital anticipates benefiting from synergies resulting from the acquisition. The deal will bring a new group of limited partners (LPs) from Latin America, enhancing Borderless' presence in the region and creating new investment opportunities.

Garcia further explained that Borderless Capital already has significant exposure to Latin America through several portfolio companies. Additionally, the firm maintains a substantial list of investors and clients from Latin America, many of whom were previously associated with CTF Capital Funds. By establishing a local office in Argentina, Borderless Capital aims to provide a more personalized and direct service to its Latin American clients.

Some of Borderless Capital's notable portfolio companies include Securitize, a comprehensive platform for digital tokenized securities; Wormhole, a blockchain infrastructure company; Blockdaemon, one of Borderless' early unicorns, specializing in blockchain infrastructure; and Helium Network, a decentralized physical infrastructure network that offers wireless connectivity for IoT and mobile devices.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GettyImages-1174590894.jpg?resize=1200,720",2024-03-26 12:49:15,Innovation,Innovation
