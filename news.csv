https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikestubbs/2024/03/24/new-valorant-agent-clove-can-come-back-from-the-dead/,New ‘Valorant’ Agent Clove Can Come Back From The Dead,"Valorant's latest agent, Clove, has made quite the impression at the recent Valorant Masters Madrid tournament. Developed by Riot Games, Clove brings a unique set of abilities to the game, including the power to come back from the dead. As the 25th agent to join the Valorant lineup, Clove is a controller who excels at disrupting enemies and providing utility for their team. With the next Valorant patch set to launch on March 26, players can look forward to experimenting with Clove's intriguing skillset.

One of Clove's abilities is Ruse, activated by pressing the E key. This ability allows players to create a smoke screen that obstructs the enemy's vision. Similar to Brimstone's smoke, Ruse brings up a small window that provides a top-down view of the current map area. From there, players can select their desired location to drop the smoke, effectively blocking the line of sight. What sets Ruse apart is its versatility - players can even use this ability while they are dead, making Clove a more valuable asset than initially anticipated.

Clove's Q ability, known as Meddle, is a grenade-like throwable that inflicts decay on enemies caught within its blast radius. While this ability may seem less impactful than the others, it still plays a crucial role in disrupting the enemy team. However, players may find themselves forgetting to utilize Meddle frequently due to its somewhat underwhelming nature.

Another ability in Clove's arsenal is Pick-Me-Up, activated by pressing the C key. This ability bears similarities to Reyna's kit, allowing players to absorb the life essence of fallen enemies. By doing so, Clove gains a temporary health buff and the ability to move with haste. While not the most innovative ability, Pick-Me-Up still contributes to Clove's overall kit and can be a game-changer in certain situations.

Now, let's talk about Clove's ultimate ability, which truly sets them apart. When Clove dies and has their ultimate ability ready to go, they can quickly activate it and come back to life for a short period. If Clove manages to secure a kill or assist during this resurrection period, they will be fully revived, as if they never died. However, if they fail to land a kill or assist, they will return to the grave once the resurrection timer expires. This unique ability adds an exciting dynamic to gameplay, as Clove remains a formidable threat even after being taken down.

Interestingly, Clove's abilities enable them to remain useful even in defeat. Their ultimate ability allows for a potential comeback, and their C ability grants them extra health upon revival. Additionally, the smokes that can be deployed after death make Clove an excellent entry fragger, as the risk of dying is significantly reduced.

Dan Hardison, an agent gameplay designer on Valorant, shed some light on the optimal way to play Clove. According to him, successful Clove gameplay involves taking risks and sacrificing one's life for the greater good. By eliminating opponents and removing their utility from the round, Clove can make a significant impact. Unlike other controllers, Clove's execute utility may be weaker on average, but their ability to contribute post-death sets them apart. Players should embrace the idea of fighting to the death rather than avoiding confrontation. In some cases, it may even be favorable for Clove to charge in and die, as long as they are traded by an ally. These 1-for-1 exchanges are advantageous for Clove, especially if their life is exchanged for a non-Clove opponent. To truly excel as Clove, players must be willing to make sacrifices for the sake of the team.

In conclusion, Clove is an exciting addition to the Valorant agent roster. With their disruptive abilities and the ability to defy death, they bring a unique playstyle to the game. Whether it's creating smoke screens, inflicting decay on enemies, or reviving after death, Clove offers a fresh and engaging experience for Valorant players. So prepare yourselves, for Clove is ready to shake up the battlefield and leave their mark on the game.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff3fefa4d4cfc35a9fc1fe/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 11:15:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have more in common than meets the eye. Both companies experienced significant growth due to their core businesses emerging from unexpected opportunities. AWS realized it could sell its internal services to external customers, while Nvidia discovered that its GPU, originally designed for gaming, was well-suited for AI workloads.

This realization led to explosive revenue growth for both companies. Nvidia's revenue skyrocketed from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024 to $22.1 billion in Q4 2024, with the majority of the growth coming from its data center business. AWS, on the other hand, consistently drove revenue for Amazon, although its growth rate has recently slowed down.

Both companies benefited from being at the right place at the right time. The rise of web apps and mobile technology in the early 2010s created a demand for on-demand cloud resources. Enterprises saw the value in moving workloads to the cloud instead of maintaining their own data centers. Similarly, the increasing popularity of AI and large language models coincided with the use of GPUs for processing these workloads.

While AWS has become a highly profitable business, there are concerns about its future growth. Nvidia, on the other hand, is experiencing rapid growth, but the question is whether it can sustain it and become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS. The GPU market may tighten, but Nvidia has other businesses that can support its growth.

In terms of financial outlook, Nvidia's revenue growth has been astronomical in recent quarters, and it is expected to continue. In its recent earnings report, Nvidia projected $24 billion worth of revenue in its current quarter, representing a 234% growth compared to the previous year. However, as the company's revenue ramps up, its growth rate is expected to decline. Analysts predict Nvidia will generate $110.5 billion in revenue in its current fiscal year, an 81% increase from the previous year.

Despite the expected growth decline, there are still significant opportunities for Nvidia in the AI market. While competition from AMD, Intel, and other chipmakers is emerging, Nvidia's market dominance gives it an advantage. AI is expected to continue driving growth for Nvidia in the coming years.

In conclusion, Nvidia and AWS share similarities in their growth trajectories and the unexpected opportunities that propelled them forward. While AWS has become a highly profitable business, Nvidia's rapid growth raises questions about its potential to become a long-term revenue powerhouse. Nevertheless, both companies have benefited from being in the right place at the right time and are well-positioned to capitalize on future opportunities.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2024/03/24/apple-ios-18-biggest-ever-iphone-update-more-details-emerge/,Apple iOS 18 Biggest-Ever iPhone Update: More Details Emerge,"Apple is known for introducing new operating software for its products, and this year's release, iOS 18, is expected to be a game-changer. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple is making significant changes to the iPhone's home screen, which is one of the most crucial parts of the operating system. Over the years, we've seen various updates to the home screen, such as the transition from an all-black background to colorful wallpapers and the ability to add personal photos. Additionally, Apple introduced visual improvements like the Depth Effect, which gives the illusion of app icons floating above the background. More recently, widgets were added to the home screen, bringing a feature that had long been available on Android phones to the iPhone.

In iOS 18, Gurman hints at the home screen becoming even more customizable. This could be similar to the improvements made to the lock screen in iOS 17. Gurman has previously mentioned that this year's iOS update is highly anticipated within the company and is considered one of the biggest updates in Apple's history. With this knowledge, Apple's developers conference in June is expected to be quite exciting.

There have also been reports of Apple negotiating with Google to incorporate Gemini generative AI features into the iPhone. Alongside the revamped home screen, Apple will focus on AI tools that assist in managing daily life. This differs from other AI features like ChatGPT. While details about the next iPhone are still scarce, it is rumored that Siri will receive a significant upgrade with AI, utilizing large-language models to enhance its capabilities as a personal assistant. Apple also announced its adoption of Rich Communication Services (RCS) for iMessage, which will be implemented in iOS 18. RCS will improve interoperability between iPhone and Android messages, although it is unlikely that Android's green message bubbles will turn blue like native iMessage bubbles.

As we await further details, it is evident that Apple has exciting plans in store for iOS 18. The company continues to innovate and enhance its products, making each new release highly anticipated. We can expect the next iPhone update to bring a range of improvements and features that will enhance the user experience. Stay tuned for more updates leading up to the June conference.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65e217bee36cf08eab202281/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2492,1662,x0,y102,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 13:00:50,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/technology/article/what-are-rpg-games/,What Is A Role-Playing Game? RPG Types Explained,"Role-playing games (RPGs) can take on various forms and hold different meanings for different people. Some see RPGs as tabletop games where they gather around with friends, rolling dice and weaving stories. Others perceive RPGs as games with character development, interactive narratives, and discussions about different gameplay experiences. Whether you're a seasoned RPG player or a beginner looking to try something new, this guide will introduce you to the most common types of RPGs, helping you find the right game to suit your interests.

What Are Role-Playing Games?
Role-playing games allow players to assume the roles of characters within a game that also serves as a story. The choices players make during gameplay influence their characters and the direction the story takes. These choices shape the narrative, which can be controlled by either a computer or another player.

The typical structure of an RPG involves players embodying a single character. They have the freedom to customize their character's appearance, behavior, and abilities within the context of the story. Characters remain part of the story until they meet one of three outcomes: death, removal by a game element, or the player's desire to switch characters.

In this traditional setup, one player takes on the role of the Game Master, also known as the Dungeon Master, Judge, Referee, Keeper, or other similar titles. The Game Master's responsibilities include guiding the story, reacting to player actions, portraying supporting or antagonist characters, and resolving any rule disputes that may arise. Game mastering can be a challenging but fulfilling role for players who want to be at the heart of every game session.

Some RPGs offer a more collaborative structure where everyone has equal control over the narrative. Game rules determine who has control over the story at any given time. These games often seek to emulate specific fictional styles or the atmosphere of other media forms like film or television.

Dungeons & Dragons is widely regarded as the earliest role-playing game, although a few games may have preceded it. Nevertheless, Dungeons & Dragons captured the attention of a vast audience upon its publication in 1974 and has since inspired countless other games, including many video game adaptations. RPGs on home computers and game consoles emerged in the 1980s and have continued to evolve and grow in complexity over the years.

Even today, Dungeons & Dragons remains the most popular tabletop RPG on the market. It has also made a significant impact in the realm of computer gaming with titles like Baldur's Gate 3. However, there are numerous other RPGs waiting to be explored, each offering unique strengths that cater to the preferences of their fans.

Types Of RPG Games
RPGs come in various forms, often blurring the lines between different genres and focusing on different aspects of gameplay. Let's take a look at some of the most common styles of role-playing games and explore a few examples within each category.

MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game)
MMORPGs are played online by thousands, or even millions, of people. Players log into a central server, create and develop their characters, and embark on missions. Some servers prioritize missions and character performance, while others encourage role-playing and the maintenance of in-character behavior.

World of Warcraft remains the most popular MMORPG to date. Other well-known examples include Guild Wars 2, EVE Online, Star Wars: The Old Republic, and Black Desert Online.

ARPG (Action Role-Playing Game)
Action role-playing games place a significant emphasis on combat mechanics. Players must learn how to fight and equip their characters appropriately. While these games often focus on single-player battles, some also offer multiplayer components.

The Diablo series serves as an excellent example of this type of RPG. Other notable titles include Elder Ring, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Borderlands.

CRPG (Computer or Console Role-Playing Game)
CRPGs encompass any RPG played on a computer or video game console. Typically, these games offer a single-player, pre-scripted experience where players follow a specific storyline, with some room for exploration within dungeons or other enclosed areas.

When people think of CRPGs, they often refer to Bioware games like Mass Effect and Dragon Age. Other notable examples include Planescape: Torment, Disco Elysium, and Shadowrun Returns.

JRPG (Japanese Role-Playing Game)
JRPGs originated on game consoles and often blend various genres like fantasy and science fiction. These games often focus on party management and emphasize dramatic relationships within the context of a ""save the world"" storyline.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fb562b1ede4feb9fc02f0c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1795,1010,x0,y92,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 12:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/grrlscientist/2024/03/24/birding-under-the-influence-by-dorian-anderson---review/,Birding Under The Influence By Dorian Anderson - Review,"Birding Under the Influence: A Journey of Healing and Discovery

Birding Under the Influence: Cycling Across America in Search of Birds and Recovery is a captivating memoir by Dorian Anderson. In this thought-provoking book, Anderson shares his personal journey of overcoming alcohol and drug addiction by immersing himself in the natural world through birdwatching. As a seasoned content editor, I have taken the liberty to clean and rewrite the text, presenting it in a blog-friendly format.

In this memoir, Anderson, a neuroscientist, recounts his decision to leave behind his high-powered research career after experiencing two years of failure. Determined to reclaim his childhood passion, he embarks on a year-long quest to observe as many bird species as possible, known in the birding community as a Big Year. With his bicycle as his sole companion, he sets off on a solo adventure across the Lower 48 states.

Anderson's idea to pursue a bicycling Big Year was sparked by an enjoyable eight-mile bike trip to Nantucket, Massachusetts, to catch a glimpse of two Northern Lapwings. Despite his limited experience in long-distance cycling, the idea persisted and captured his imagination.

From the very first day of 2014, as Anderson leaves Boston, his physical journey is fraught with dangers. He braves cycling through snowstorms during a polar vortex in Massachusetts, narrowly escapes accidents on the Cross Bronx Expressway in New York City, battles extreme winds that threaten to blow him off the road, encounters hostile motorists and long-haul truckers, and is chased by countless angry dogs. Throughout his journey, he faces 34 flat tires and various other biking mishaps, all while traversing from the northeast to Florida, across the Texas desert, over the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Northwest, and finally down to Southern California. Along the way, Anderson finds solace in the breathtaking beauty of the American landscape, from the Florida Everglades to the majestic Rocky Mountains and the enchanting Redwood forests of Oregon.

Long-distance bicycling provides Anderson with ample time for introspection. He shares his reflections on life and the choices he has made through short vignettes interwoven within the larger narrative of his epic bike ride. As readers, we gain insight into his academic achievements, scientific research, struggles with alcohol and drug addiction, which originated in high school, and his four years of sobriety. Through pushing his physical and psychological limits, Anderson envisions a new and radically different future for himself, one free from the shackles of addiction.

As Anderson chronicles his daily adventures on the road through his blog, he quickly captures the attention of a diverse group of birders across the country. Some extend their hospitality by providing meals or a bed for a night or two, generously sharing their philosophies and offering warm showers. These interactions offer a fascinating glimpse into the regional subcultures that exist within the American birding community.

Over the course of twelve months, Anderson bicycles a staggering 17,830 miles, traversing twenty-eight states. He also covers at least 493 miles on foot (although he suspects the actual distance may be three times greater) and kayaks for eight miles in pursuit of both common and rare bird species. Along his journey, Anderson raises nearly $50,000 for bird habitat conservation. Remarkably, he emerges from this transformative experience in the best physical shape of his life, boasting a resting heart rate below 40 beats per minute.

In total, Anderson spots 618 different bird species. As his Big Year nears its end on Thanksgiving Day, he stumbles upon a species that had never before been reported in the United States—a female/juvenile red-legged honeycreeper. After sharing this exciting discovery online, local birders drop everything to flock to Estero Llaño Grande State Park, eager to catch a glimpse of this rare visitor.

While Birding Under the Influence is generally well-written, closer editing could have tightened the prose and smoothed some of the transitions between adventure and self-reflection. Nevertheless, Anderson's raw blog material has been skillfully transformed into a narrative that delves deep into his existential struggles. He confronts his personal demons with unflinching honesty, all while maintaining the immediacy and wonder of his birding adventure.

It is worth noting that the absence of a map or maps detailing Anderson's journey is a missed opportunity. Including visual representations of his route would have enhanced the reading experience, allowing readers to better follow his captivating adventure. Additionally, a final state-by-state summary would have provided a comprehensive overview of the author's remarkable achievements.

Birding Under the Influence: Cycling Across America in Search of Birds and Recovery is a memoir that captivates readers with its tales of healing, self-discovery, and the beauty of the natural world. Anderson's journey serves as an inspiration to those facing their own challenges, illustrating the transformative power of reconnecting with one's passions. This memoir is a testament to the human spirit's ability to overcome adversity, reminding us of the importance of embracing life's wonders.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff194d2ccb9152d392146c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=812,456,x0,y57,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 12:17:44,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/technology/article/moba-games/,Top Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) Games,"MOBAs, or multiplayer online battle arena games, have gained immense popularity over the past 15 years. Initially starting as a modification for a popular strategy game, MOBAs have evolved into standalone games that continuously compete for the top spot in the genre. While some challengers have fallen by the wayside, the giants of the MOBA world continue to attract millions of players every month. However, finding the best MOBA for yourself can still be a daunting task if you're unsure where to look.

A multiplayer online battle arena game is an online game that pits two teams, usually consisting of five players each, against each other in a strategic battle to destroy the opponent's base using unique player-controlled characters. These games are typically played on PC or mobile devices and have gained popularity due to their challenging gameplay and difficult-to-master mechanics.

The MOBA genre originated as a mod for Warcraft III, a popular strategy game with a thriving modding scene. The first widely recognized MOBA was Defense of the Ancients (DotA), which started as a mod but soon became a major game in its own right. The team behind DotA eventually left to create their own MOBA, which became known as League of Legends and instantly captivated players. Valve, the developers of the Steam games platform, also jumped into the MOBA market by acquiring members of the original DotA team to create Dota 2, a direct competitor to League of Legends. This sparked a period where various publishers attempted to build their own MOBAs, but most failed to gain traction.

Throughout the years, numerous MOBAs have been released across different platforms. Some have become incredibly popular and stood the test of time, while others were forgotten within months. The top MOBA games today are the ones that have a large and loyal audience, often due to their unique offerings or ability to engage players for years. It's worth noting that two of the biggest MOBAs in the world are more than a decade old and continue to innovate in a genre filled with imitators. These games can be considered the best of the best, as they still provide an enjoyable experience and have received critical acclaim from experts in the field.

Dota 2, the direct sequel to the original DotA mod, has remained one of the most popular games on Steam for over 10 years. Developed by Valve and the lead developer of the original DotA mod, Dota 2 retains the core elements of the MOBA genre while offering a more accessible experience for players. With constant updates, including map changes, new characters, and balance adjustments, Dota 2 has evolved significantly over the years. However, the essence of the game remains the same: two teams of five players fight across a three-lane map to destroy the enemy's Ancient and emerge victorious. Dota 2 is often regarded as one of the most complex games in the world, featuring numerous variables and mechanics that can take thousands of hours to master. Even experienced players admit that there are aspects of the game they still don't fully grasp. The best part is that Dota 2 is entirely free to play, with optional microtransactions for cosmetic items being the only form of payment.

League of Legends, on the other hand, is the largest MOBA in the world, boasting over 100 million monthly active players. Its success revolutionized the entire industry and kickstarted the MOBA craze. Initially released in 2009, League of Legends captured the attention of players and inspired numerous companies to create their own LoL clones. However, it was the original game that stood the test of time. Developed by Riot Games, a team consisting of developers from the original DotA mod, League of Legends aimed to simplify some of the more complex aspects of DotA, making it more accessible to newcomers. While maintaining the basic three-lane map and the objective of destroying the enemy's base, League of Legends removed some of the less crucial but more intricate elements found in DotA. This resulted in a slightly less complex version of the MOBA format, which resonated with a wide audience.

In conclusion, MOBAs have become a global phenomenon, captivating millions of players worldwide. Dota 2 and League of Legends, in particular, have emerged as the top contenders in the genre, offering unique gameplay experiences and amassing massive player bases. Whether you're looking for a complex and challenging game or a more accessible option, these two MOBAs are undoubtedly worth exploring. So, dive into the world of MOBAs and discover the excitement and thrill that awaits you!",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fb05c9fa323af23f667c73/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 14:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
