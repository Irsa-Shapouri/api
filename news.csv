Lazy Sunday is here, and what better way to spend it than by solving the Wordle puzzle? But before we dive into that, let me share a little confession. I have a secret desire to make rabbit pot pies on Easter. The thought of that savory dish paired with the irony of using rabbit meat is simply delicious. Perhaps one day I'll make it happen. But for now, let's focus on Wordle.

For those who are new to Wordle, it's a captivating word puzzle game that has gained quite a following. And guess what? I've been writing Strands guides for weeks now. It's another word puzzle game that guarantees endless fun. You can check out today's guide on my blog.

Now, let's get down to business and solve today's Wordle puzzle. Are you ready for some hints and clues? Here they are:

Wordle Analysis: My Journey to the Answer

Every day, I eagerly check Wordle Bot to see how well I did. If you haven't tried it yet, you can check your Wordles with Wordle Bot too. Now, let me walk you through my thought process.

My initial guess was ""chain,"" which left me with a staggering 681 possibilities. That was definitely not what I had in mind. But then, I had a stroke of luck. The word ""slope"" came to mind, and it significantly reduced the options to a more manageable 19. Feeling confident, I went with ""below."" It just felt right, even though it might have been a Wordle answer in the past. And guess what? It was correct! Was it pure coincidence or a result of my Strands puzzle practice? Who knows?

Competitive Wordle Score: A Total Wash

Unfortunately, luck wasn't on my side this time. I scored a big fat zero points for guessing in four tries and also for tying with the Wordle Bot. It happens to the best of us, right?

Uncovering the Etymology of ""Towel""

Now, let's take a moment to explore the fascinating history behind the word ""towel."" Did you know that its origins can be traced back to Old French? The term ""touaille"" made its way into English usage around the 13th century. But the story doesn't stop there.

The Old French word ""touaille"" is believed to have its roots in Medieval Latin, specifically the term ""tovaglia."" This Latin word likely derived from ""tubicula,"" a diminutive form of ""tuba,"" meaning ""tube"" or ""cloth."" The evolution of language reflects the practical use and significance of towels in daily life. Initially, they were simply pieces of cloth used for drying or wiping.

It's interesting to note that the Norman Conquest of England in 1066 had a significant impact on the English language. The linguistic influences of Norman French led to the Anglicization of many French-origin words, including ""towel."" Over time, the pronunciation and spelling changed, giving us the modern English word we use today. Towels have been a household staple for centuries, evolving in material and purpose, while still serving their fundamental function of drying and wiping.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/23/apple-sued-microsofts-ai-ambitions-and-nvidia-surprises/,"Apple sued, Microsoft's AI ambitions and Nvidia's surprises","In this Week in Review, we bring you the latest updates on the Apple antitrust lawsuit and Microsoft’s AI advancements. Let’s jump into the details…

The U.S. has joined global regulators in accusing Apple of employing monopolistic tactics to retain iPhone users. Apple defends its position by stating that the DOJ's actions could jeopardize the user experience that its customers cherish.

Drawing a parallel between Apple and Microsoft of the 1990s, the DOJ's lawsuit highlights the efforts of both companies to maintain their customer base. Despite similarities, there are distinct differences between their approaches.

Experts anticipate a lengthy legal process for the Apple antitrust lawsuit, estimating a resolution could take three to five years to materialize.

Moving on to other news, Microsoft has acquired the co-founders of Inflection AI in a significant deal. Mustafa Suleyman will lead Microsoft AI's consumer-facing unit, while Karén Simonyan assumes the role of EVP and CEO within the same group. This acquisition follows Inflection's successful funding round of $1.3 billion, with Microsoft as a major investor.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2024/03/23/apple-iphone-16-pro-ios-18-ai-china-baidu-google-gemini/,Apple’s Latest AI Move To Change Your New iPhone,"As Apple gears up to unveil its AI strategy for the iPhone, a potential collaboration with Google seems to be on the horizon, alongside a new partnership with China's Baidu.

The iPhone 15 series has lagged behind in the AI race compared to flagship Android devices, with generative AI features notably absent. However, iOS 18 is expected to debut at the upcoming Worldwide Developer Conference, bringing generative AI capabilities to the next-generation iPhone 16 lineup.

Apple, like other smartphone manufacturers, will prioritize a combination of on-device and cloud-based AI processing. While Apple is known for its emphasis on local data processing, the cloud will play a crucial role in handling AI tasks that require substantial computational power.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianmazique/2024/03/23/ufcs-dana-white-cuts-fighter-immediately-after-he-bit-an-opponent/,UFC’s Dana White Cuts Fighter Immediately After He Bit An Opponent,"Pressure and combat sports can sometimes push athletes to do unthinkable things. The most recent example occurred at UFC Fight Night: Ribas vs. Namajunas, where a shocking incident took place during a preliminary bout.

In his UFC debut, Igor Severino, a 20-year-old fighter from Brazil, bit his opponent Andre Lima in the second round. This act of aggression resulted in Severino's disqualification from the fight. The bite marks on Lima's arm were clearly visible, leaving no room for doubt about what had transpired.

Severino had an opportunity to make a name for himself in the UFC, but his actions on that night have made it difficult for him to continue his career with the promotion. Dana White, the CEO of UFC, wasted no time in making the decision to cut Severino from the organization. In an interview with KevinIole.com, White expressed his disappointment, stating, ""Those were two up-and-coming undefeated fighters. If you're frustrated and want out of the fight, there are plenty of ways to go about it, but biting your opponent is the worst thing you can do. Now, you not only lose the biggest opportunity of your life, but you also face potential consequences from the NSAC.""

This loss marked the first of Severino's career, bringing his record to 9-1. On the other hand, Lima maintained his undefeated streak, with a record of 8-0. Despite being the victim of the bite, Lima remained remarkably composed throughout the incident. He calmly informed the referee about what had happened, initiating a brief investigation into the infraction.

Severino's future in the world of mixed martial arts looks uncertain. He will need to rebuild his reputation by competing in smaller promotions before he can even consider making a comeback in the UFC or any other reputable organization such as the Professional Fighters League.

As the events of Saturday's fights come to a close in Las Vegas, stay tuned for more updates and traditional results from the night's other matchups. The world of combat sports never fails to surprise us, and the actions of Severino serve as a stark reminder of the consequences that come with losing control in the heat of battle.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff92c285143669667fa59c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3188,1794,x0,y217,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-23 22:45:24,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/23/explained-the-difference-between-a-solar-eclipse-and-a-lunar-eclipse/,Explained: The Difference Between A Solar Eclipse And A Lunar Eclipse,"Do you understand the distinction between a solar eclipse and a lunar eclipse? Two exciting celestial events are on the horizon—a lunar eclipse on March 25 and a solar eclipse on April 8. While these occurrences may seem worlds apart, they stem from the same cosmic alignment.

When it comes to lunar eclipses, Earth's shadow is cast upon the moon during a full moon phase. Conversely, solar eclipses transpire when the moon obstructs the sun's rays, casting a shadow on Earth. The rarity of both events is attributed to the slight disparity in the orbital planes of Earth and the moon around the sun.

A lunar eclipse exclusively takes place during a full moon, when Earth positions itself between the sun and the moon, projecting a shadow into space. Although full moons recur approximately every 29 days, lunar eclipses are infrequent due to the moon's sporadic passage through Earth's shadow.

On the other hand, a solar eclipse occurs during a new moon phase, with the moon positioned between the sun and Earth, casting a shadow on our planet. Despite new moons also occurring every 29 days, instances where the moon obstructs the sun from Earth's perspective are seldom witnessed.

The occurrence of a total lunar eclipse necessitates a precise alignment of the sun, Earth, and moon. As the moon drifts into Earth's umbra, it is devoid of direct sunlight, causing its surface to reflect sunlight refracted by Earth's atmosphere. This phenomenon results in a captivating display of pinkish-red hues on the lunar surface, colloquially known as a ""Blood Moon.""

Conversely, a total solar eclipse is brought about by the perfect alignment of the sun, moon, and Earth, coupled with a celestial anomaly. The moon's umbra, projected onto Earth during a total solar eclipse, moves across the planet due to the moon's west-to-east orbit. Those within the umbral shadow's path witness the awe-inspiring spectacle of a total solar eclipse.

Eclipses, whether lunar or solar, are relatively rare occurrences due to the moon's orbital tilt and its intersection with the sun's trajectory. This orbital configuration results in two eclipse seasons annually, during which solar and lunar eclipses occur. However, the majority of solar eclipses are partial or annular, while lunar eclipses are predominantly penumbral or partial.

Looking ahead to 2024 and 2025, sky-watchers can anticipate a series of lunar and solar eclipses during designated ""eclipse seasons."" These celestial events promise to captivate audiences across different regions of the globe, offering a glimpse into the mesmerizing dance of celestial bodies.

As we prepare for the upcoming lunar and solar eclipses, let's marvel at the wonders of the universe and embrace the opportunity to witness these celestial phenomena firsthand. Stay tuned for more updates on the upcoming total solar eclipse on April 8, and may your skies be clear and your eyes wide open.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65f6b43702078076f68d7fcf/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-23 19:00:00,Innovation,Innovation

Have you ever thought you witnessed a total solar eclipse? Chances are, you actually saw a partial eclipse. Total solar eclipses are rare and unforgettable events that leave a lasting impression on those lucky enough to witness them. To truly experience totality, you must be within the path of totality, where the moon completely blocks the sun.

In North America, the continent has been experiencing a surge in total solar eclipses, with the most recent being the ""Great American Eclipse"" in 2017. This event brought totality to 12 U.S. states, captivating millions of people with the awe-inspiring sight of the sun's corona shining around the silhouette of the moon.

If you're unsure whether you've seen a total solar eclipse, there are ways to confirm your experience. By checking the Solar Eclipses Visibility Database or consulting interactive maps, you can determine if you were within the path of totality during a specific eclipse.

Looking ahead, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity awaits on April 8, 2024. This total solar eclipse will be visible from parts of Mexico, the United States, and Canada, offering a shared experience for an estimated 42 million people. Only those within a narrow path will witness totality, making it a highly anticipated event for eclipse enthusiasts.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2024/03/24/epa-didnt-ban-gas-cars-it-cut-air-pollution-so-we-can-breathe-easier/,EPA Didn’t Ban Gas Cars. It Cut Air Pollution So We Can Breathe Easier.,"Every person who has experienced a red air day knows the unpleasant taste and sensation of air pollution. It leaves a metallic sting in your nose and lungs, making it difficult to breathe. On these days, when pollution levels reach unhealthy levels, people are advised to stay indoors and avoid outdoor activities. This is especially important for vulnerable populations such as the elderly, children, pregnant women, and those with respiratory illnesses.

But have you ever wondered what the main cause of toxic air is in most places? The answer lies in the internal combustion engines that power our vehicles. Whether fueled by gas or diesel, these engines emit dirty pollution that not only harms our health but also contributes to climate change. Shockingly, more than two-thirds of Americans rely on personal automobiles for their day-to-day travel. As a result, transportation has become the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. Light-duty vehicles alone account for nearly 60% of the pollution in this sector.

If we want to tackle our pervasive air pollution problem, we must focus on reducing tailpipe pollution from vehicles. The good news is that we have a proven tool that can make our cars cleaner and help us all breathe easier: tailpipe emissions standards. These standards require automakers to adopt the latest clean technologies, ensuring that new vehicles are cleaner than ever before.

Just last week, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) took a significant step by adopting new multi-pollutant rules for light-duty and smaller medium-duty vehicles. These rules limit tailpipe pollution that poisons the air we breathe and accelerates climate change. By implementing these updated standards, automakers are compelled to embrace clean technologies, making our vehicles more environmentally friendly.

It is essential that everyone, regardless of where they live, has the choice to make their next car a clean car. Those who care about reducing pollution deserve the option to drive electric vehicles. Electric cars produce zero tailpipe emissions, offering a sustainable and clean transportation solution.

However, there are powerful forces that do not want to see these positive changes in our vehicle emissions standards. Corporations that profit from selling vehicles that pollute our air and petroleum companies that rely on fossil fuels view these standards as a threat. They argue that these regulations limit American freedoms and consumer choice. But the truth is that these updated pollution limits are long overdue and will benefit all Americans by cleaning the air we breathe and providing consumers with more sustainable options.

Consider the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers' recent launch of a ""major seven-figure issue campaign."" Their campaign targets critical states and aims to inform Americans about the Biden administration's efforts to ban new gas, diesel, and flex fuel vehicles from the U.S. market. This is a prime example of how profit-driven corporate polluters actively manipulate the American public to believe that these standards are unwarranted. They spread disinformation, falsely claiming that these rules are a ban on gas cars.

In reality, the EPA does not have the authority to ban technologies or modes of transportation. The agency's standards are technology-neutral, performance-based, and grounded in scientific research. The Clean Air Act, signed into law in 1970, empowers the EPA to establish National Ambient Air Quality Standards to protect public health and welfare. It also directs the agency to regulate emissions from vehicles and engines and adapt the standards over time.

The earliest standards for light-duty vehicles required a 90% reduction in emissions from hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide. These standards drove the development of new engine and emission control technologies, such as the catalytic converter, and led to the switch to unleaded fuel. Before the Clean Air Act, our cities were choked with air pollution so thick that breathing in places like New York City was as harmful as smoking two packs of cigarettes per day. Los Angeles, in particular, suffered from unhealthy levels of air pollution for more than 200 days a year.

It is clear that we have come a long way in improving air quality, but there is still work to be done. We cannot allow profit-driven interests to derail our progress and harm our health and the environment. It is crucial for individuals to understand the truth behind these updated standards and support efforts to reduce tailpipe pollution. By doing so, we can create a cleaner and healthier future for ourselves and future generations.

In conclusion, the adoption of new tailpipe emissions standards by the EPA is a significant step towards reducing air pollution and combating climate change. These standards compel automakers to embrace clean technologies, making our vehicles cleaner than ever before. It is important for everyone to have the choice to make their next car a clean car, and electric vehicles offer a sustainable solution. We must not be swayed by disinformation campaigns from profit-driven interests. These updated pollution limits are long overdue and will benefit all Americans by cleaning the air we breathe and providing consumers with more sustainable options. Let us support efforts to reduce tailpipe pollution and create a cleaner and healthier future for ourselves and future generations.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fe401fc35aefb76700b52e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 07:45:00,Innovation,Innovation

The cerebral areas located in the frontal lobe, responsible for attention, organizational skills, and emotional responses, are abnormally active or have a specific anatomy. There is also an imbalance in levels of some chemical messengers in the brain, such as dopamine and noradrenaline.

A recent study involving 221,714 individuals with ADHD revealed that those prescribed ADHD stimulant medications had a lower risk of suicide attempts and psychiatric hospitalizations. Heidi Taipale and her team at Karolinska Institute in Stockholm found that specific ADHD medications like amphetamine, lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate were associated with decreased psychiatric hospitalizations.

While lisdexamphetamine, dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate were linked to a reduced risk of suicidal behavior, atomoxetine showed a correlation with fewer hospitalizations for non-psychiatric co-morbidities. Psychiatric co-morbidities, including major depressive disorder, panic disorder, substance abuse, and others, were prevalent among individuals with ADHD, increasing the risk of mortality, especially when combined with substance use disorder.

The study highlighted the positive impact of ADHD medications, particularly stimulants, on improving functioning and quality of life. However, the long-term effectiveness and safety of these pharmacotherapies require further investigation due to potential adverse outcomes like psychosis or cardiovascular diseases.

Analyzing data from the Swedish National Patient Register and Prescribed Drug Register, the researchers tracked medication use and hospitalization rates among ADHD-diagnosed individuals aged 16 to 65 over a 15-year period. Methylphenidate, lisdexamphetamine, and atomoxetine were the most commonly prescribed medications, with varying effectiveness across different age groups and genders.

The findings, published in JAMA Network Open, underscored the overall beneficial effects of ADHD medications on psychiatric outcomes while noting potential concerns about long-term stimulant use. Future research should continue to explore the relationship between ADHD pharmacotherapies and both positive and negative health outcomes to optimize treatment strategies for individuals with ADHD.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/63c28dbb82c31b7412c92cf2/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 04:09:46,Innovation,Innovation
