https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/03/25/ai-and-money-movement-human-guardrails-are-a-must/,AI And Money Movement: Human Guardrails Are A Must,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize various industries, including payment operations. However, it is crucial to approach its implementation thoughtfully and with human management. Payment operations encompass the movement of money, whether it is between businesses (B2B), businesses and consumers (B2C), or vice versa. Accuracy is of utmost importance in money movement, as any errors can result in severe reputational damage and financial consequences. Therefore, the integration of AI into payment operations should be accompanied by payment operations software that provides guardrails to ensure accuracy while allowing companies to benefit from increased efficiencies.

According to research conducted by consulting firm Edgar, Dunn & Company, payment professionals worldwide anticipate a growing use of AI and machine learning in the industry. The leading use cases for AI in payment operations include detecting fraud and enhancing customer service. AI is well-suited to address challenges in payment operations, particularly in areas where workflows are highly repetitive, such as data translation, transaction reconciliation, and processing large volumes of data to present a concise set of information for human review.

There is also significant potential for AI in areas of payment operations where the risks of making mistakes are low. For example, if a customer wants to inquire about the status of a payment, automation and AI can easily handle such requests. AI and automation can also expedite notifications and investigations, thereby improving customer service. For instance, when selling a home or receiving a paycheck, it is beneficial to be promptly notified when the wire transfer or payment is credited to one's bank account. Additionally, if an individual expects a $100 payment but only receives $50, an AI application can investigate the discrepancy. An AI-powered app that takes into account an individual's budget, upcoming bills, and savings preferences can suggest suitable solutions in real-time.

AI can also assist in determining the most appropriate payment rail for each payment type. Payment rail refers to the method of transferring funds, such as checks, ACH, wire transfers, or instant payments through systems like FedNow or the RTP network. By considering factors such as risk, speed, and cost, AI can analyze the context of a specific payment and make an informed decision regarding the best payment rail to utilize.

Furthermore, AI can contribute to making informed decisions about utilizing available funds effectively. For instance, a company that always needs $1 million in cash reserves but is willing to invest any surplus funds in higher interest-bearing accounts could benefit from an AI-powered application. Such an application could identify suitable accounts and facilitate the transfer of funds, ensuring that the required $1 million is readily available.

Reconciliation is another area where AI can play a role, although it often requires human oversight. Accuracy is paramount when it comes to handling finances, and software used for payment reconciliation may be deterministic, meaning it is accurate 100% of the time. However, exceptions can occur, such as when transactions do not match due to differences in names, addresses, or misspellings. In such cases, manual intervention is typically necessary, which can be both costly and time-consuming. AI can assist in handling these exceptions by quickly analyzing address databases and suggesting the appropriate allocation for payments. The human overseer then reviews the suggestion, ensuring accurate reconciliation. This combination of AI and human involvement not only achieves 100% reconciliation but also enhances productivity in the workflow of payment professionals.

When considering the implementation of AI in payment operations, certain questions need to be addressed. Firstly, it is essential to assess the risk versus reward of allowing AI to make decisions. While AI can handle notifications and research with minimal risk, the stakes are higher when it comes to making payments or reconciling them. A payment sent to the wrong recipient can be challenging to recover, leading to potential financial losses. Safeguards must be in place to regulate AI applications, similar to the restrictions placed on human workers involved in money movement. Access to various capabilities should be carefully controlled to ensure the integrity of the payment process.

Perfection is crucial in money movement. While a generative AI tool making errors in a job description may not have significant consequences, inaccuracies in payment amounts or timing can have severe implications. Companies operating in the payment industry are expected to deliver flawless services, and any failures in this regard require substantial efforts to rebuild trust.

Lastly, the implementation of AI should ultimately result in freeing up human workers from mundane and routine tasks. Automation of repetitive tasks is necessary for businesses to remain competitive in a technology-driven economy. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate whether AI deployment will genuinely alleviate workers from these tasks and allow them to focus on more critical aspects of the job.

In summary, AI has the potential to revolutionize payment operations, but careful management and human oversight are crucial. By using AI in payment operations, companies can enhance fraud detection, improve customer service, streamline workflows, expedite notifications and investigations, optimize payment rail selection, and make informed decisions about fund allocation. However, the implementation of AI should be accompanied by appropriate safeguards, as accuracy and perfection are paramount in the realm of money movement. Furthermore, AI should free up human workers from mundane tasks, enabling them to contribute to more critical business objectives. As the payment industry progresses, the thoughtful integration of AI will undoubtedly play a significant role in shaping its future.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fdc40b985d05a8654469f7/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 08:15:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have more in common than you might think. Both companies experienced significant growth due to the emergence of their core businesses. AWS realized it could sell its internal services, while Nvidia discovered that its gaming-focused GPU was well-suited for processing AI workloads. This led to explosive revenue growth for both companies.

Nvidia's revenue has been growing at an incredible rate, reaching $22.1 billion in Q4 2024 from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024. However, most of this growth came from the company's data center business. In comparison, AWS has consistently been a major revenue driver for Amazon, although its growth has started to slow down. Microsoft and Google have also entered the market, creating the Big Three cloud vendors. As the market continues to expand, other chip makers are expected to gain market share.

Both Nvidia and AWS were in the right place at the right time. The rise of web apps and mobile technology in the early 2010s led to increased demand for cloud resources, while the growth of AI and large language models coincided with the increased use of GPUs for processing these workloads.

While AWS has become a highly profitable business, with a run rate close to $100 billion, its growth has started to decline. Nvidia, on the other hand, is experiencing rapid growth. The question is whether Nvidia can sustain this growth and become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS. While Nvidia has other businesses, such as gaming and automotive, they are smaller and growing more slowly than the data center business.

In the short term, Nvidia's revenue growth is expected to continue. The company anticipates $24 billion in revenue for the current quarter, a 234% increase compared to the previous year. However, the growth rate is expected to decline from the previous quarter. Analysts predict that Nvidia will generate $110.5 billion in revenue for the current fiscal year, an 81% increase from the previous year. Although this is lower than the growth rate in the previous fiscal year, it is still impressive.

Looking ahead, AI is expected to continue driving growth for Nvidia. Despite increasing competition from AMD, Intel, and other chip makers, Nvidia currently controls a significant portion of the market. However, competition will grow, and Nvidia will need to adapt. At the chip level, Nvidia remains dominant, but AMD is gaining ground at the board level.

In conclusion, Nvidia has the potential to become the next AWS. With its strong position in the market and the continued growth of AI, Nvidia is well-positioned for future success. However, it will face increasing competition and will need to adapt to maintain its position.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/03/25/ai-advancement-a-double-edged-sword-for-cisos/,AI Advancement: A Double-Edged Sword For CISOs,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a double-edged sword in the realm of cybersecurity. While it offers opportunities for better security measures, it also poses significant threats. In this article, we will explore the five major threats AI presents and how Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) can turn them into opportunities.

AI has transformed phishing attacks into highly personalized and convincing schemes. By processing stolen data, AI can create messages that closely resemble trusted sources, tailored to individuals based on their personal information. This sophisticated approach increases the likelihood of deceiving individuals into revealing confidential information. However, AI also equips CISOs with powerful tools to protect their companies more efficiently.

So, what are the top five AI cybersecurity threats CISOs should be prepared for?

1. AI-Phishing: AI can create phishing emails that are almost indistinguishable from real ones, potentially granting unauthorized access to sensitive information.

2. Increased Sophistication of APTs: AI enables cybercriminals to enhance their toolkit, making it more challenging to detect phishing attacks, malware, and advanced persistent threats (APTs). Traditional security defenses may struggle to keep up.

3. Automated Vulnerability Hunting: AI algorithms can scan systems for vulnerabilities at a rapid pace, sometimes faster than we can fix them. This highlights the race against time to address vulnerabilities before they are exploited.

4. Evasion of Detection Systems: AI-based malware and cyberattacks are difficult to detect as they bypass standard security checks, such as signature-based and anomaly detection systems.

5. Disinformation and Deepfakes: AI can generate fake videos, audio, and texts that appear authentic, making them ideal for spreading misinformation, damaging brand reputation, or targeting phishing attacks.

Despite these threats, there are also five AI-driven cybersecurity opportunities for CISOs to capitalize on:

1. Threat Detection: AI's ability to filter through data at incredible speed makes it easier to detect security risks by identifying rare patterns. This proactive approach allows companies to prevent harm before it occurs.

2. Forecasting Risks: AI can predict future attacks, enabling companies to prepare for and mitigate threats before they strike. This can be achieved through the use of User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) and machine learning-based detection systems.

3. Streamlined Security Tasks: By replacing basic functions with AI, such as network activity supervision and filtering out false alarms, CISOs can focus on more complex security issues. This automation can significantly improve incident reporting, reducing human efforts and speeding up the process.

4. Spotting Phishing Attempts: AI can enhance defenses against phishing by inspecting emails and websites for signs of fraud, making it more challenging for these attacks to succeed.

5. Smart Access Control: AI leverages behavioral analysis to improve security by detecting abnormal user behavior, such as accessing data at odd times or locations, which may indicate security breaches.

Why should CISOs consider using AI in cybersecurity?

The answer is simple: to prepare for tomorrow. AI is a double-edged sword for CISOs. While it increases the chances of sophisticated cyberattacks, it also provides strong defenses, enabling fast threat identification and even prediction. AI automates routine security activities, freeing up CISOs to tackle more complex problems. Additionally, it enhances protection against phishing and monitors user activities for potential breaches.

By harnessing the power of AI, CISOs can strengthen their defenses and pave the way for a safer digital future. They must approach AI solutions with open eyes and ready hands, transforming obstacles into stepping stones towards a secure online environment. The clock is ticking, and it's time to embrace AI in cybersecurity.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65c665858486a2b4671d9af8/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 07:45:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/boeing-ceo-to-leave-company-by-year-end-after-a-wave-of-safety-incidents/,"Boeing CEO to leave company by year-end, after a wave of safety incidents","Boeing CEO to Depart Company by Year-End Following Safety Incidents

In a surprising turn of events, Boeing's chief executive, Dave Calhoun, has announced that he will be leaving the company by the end of 2024. This decision comes on the heels of a series of safety incidents that have plagued the aircraft manufacturer in recent years.

One such incident involved a cabin panel blowout on one of Boeing's planes, which raised serious concerns about the company's commitment to passenger safety. This, coupled with a number of other safety-related incidents, has left Boeing in a precarious position.

As part of its efforts to foster innovation and collaboration within the aerospace industry, Boeing operates a program called Aerospace Xelerated. Formerly known as the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI), this initiative aims to support and accelerate the growth of aerospace startups. It remains unclear how Calhoun's departure will impact this program, but TechCrunch has reached out to Aerospace Xelerated for further clarification.

In a statement released by the company, Calhoun expressed his intention to ""complete the critical work underway to stabilize and position the company for the future"" in the coming months. This suggests that Boeing is committed to addressing the safety concerns and ensuring a smooth transition in leadership.

The most recent incident that has cast a shadow over Boeing's reputation involved an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 jet, which was forced to make an emergency landing in January. As a result, 171 Max 9 jets were temporarily grounded, amplifying the gravity of the situation. This incident has been deemed the company's most significant safety crisis since the tragic crashes of two Max 8 jets in 2018 and 2019, which claimed the lives of 346 individuals.

In addition to Calhoun's departure, Stan Deal, who currently oversees Boeing's commercial airplanes business, will also be leaving the company. This executive shakeup underscores the need for a fresh start and a renewed focus on safety and quality within the organization.

It is worth noting that this story is still developing, and more information is expected to emerge in the coming days. We will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as new details emerge.

As Boeing prepares to bid farewell to its CEO and embark on a new chapter, it is crucial for the company to prioritize safety and regain the trust of passengers and industry stakeholders. The road to recovery may be long and arduous, but with the right leadership and a steadfast commitment to excellence, Boeing has the potential to restore its once-sterling reputation.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1910140688.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-25 12:48:28,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/techcrunch-mobility-the-wheels-are-starting-to-come-off-the-fisker-ev-bus/,TechCrunch Mobility: The wheels are starting to come off the Fisker EV bus,"Welcome to TechCrunch Mobility, your go-to source for news and insights on the future of transportation. In this edition, we'll be discussing some recent developments in the automotive industry, including new regulations proposed by the Biden Administration. We'll also cover various startup and tech news related to mobility. So let's dive in!

First, let's address the regulatory changes introduced by the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These proposals will have a significant impact on U.S. automakers and ultimately, consumers like you. While the regulations have been softened to accommodate the automotive industry, car dealers, and unions, they still impose stricter standards than before.

The DOE has introduced a ""petroleum equivalency factor"" that assigns a score to electric vehicles (EVs) under the government's corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. The original proposal would have made it challenging for automakers to meet these standards, potentially resulting in hefty fines. However, the revised version is more lenient, providing some relief to manufacturers.

Meanwhile, the EPA has released tailpipe standards for model years 2027 to 2032, imposing stiffer requirements on automakers. However, the standards are now technology agnostic, allowing manufacturers to meet them through various powertrains. This flexibility is a departure from the previous proposal, which would have required EV sales to make up 67% of the U.S. passenger vehicle market by 2032.

While these regulations don't have a significant impact on EV startups like Rivian, Tesla, and Lucid, they do pose challenges for legacy automakers. These companies are investing billions in developing, building, and selling EVs while still profiting from internal combustion engine vehicles. In this context, plug-in hybrids may emerge as winners since they offer a compromise between traditional and electric vehicles.

Now, let's move on to some exciting startup news. We recently heard about Clevon, a company specializing in autonomous delivery technology. The company faced difficulties in securing new investments and was on the verge of shutting down. However, there is new hope as Clevon has entered into an exclusivity agreement for a merger with an American electric vehicle company. The agreement is expected to be finalized by the first half of June.

In another significant development, Uber has made its first investment in an Africa-founded startup. The company has invested in Moove, an African mobility fintech that provides vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers. This investment highlights Uber's commitment to a fully zero-emission fleet by 2040, as Moove has made electric vehicles a central part of its business strategy.

Lastly, we'd like to mention a couple of other noteworthy deals. Amber, a Bay Area startup, recently raised $3.18 million in a seed round. The company offers an aftermarket Tesla extended warranty product, catering to Tesla owners' needs. Additionally, Candela, an electric boat maker, secured $25 million in funding led by Groupe Beneteau. This investment will support Candela's mission to revolutionize the boating industry with its electric-powered vessels.

That wraps up this edition of TechCrunch Mobility. We hope you found these insights and news stories compelling. Stay tuned for more updates on the future of transportation.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1363022906.jpg?resize=1200,730",2024-03-24 19:00:33,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-deep-geothermal-renewable-powerhouse.html,Dig deep: US bets on geothermal to become renewable powerhouse,"Geothermal energy has the potential to play a significant role in the green transition, according to several businesses and the Biden administration. While it currently represents a small fraction of US energy production, advancements in technology could make it a clean and reliable source of power. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm believes that geothermal energy could surpass hydroelectric and solar power by 2050.

Geothermal energy harnesses the heat from underground to generate electricity and heat buildings. In 2022, it accounted for only 1.6 percent of US energy consumption. To increase production, the US government has invested over $200 million in an experimental site in Utah. This site focuses on Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), a technology that involves injecting water into hot rocks deep underground.

An analyst with S&P Global Commodity Insights, Francesco d'Avack, explains that geothermal energy can be produced anywhere, making it a versatile option. Additionally, the upfront risk is lower compared to other energy sources, as drilling for geothermal energy has a lower chance of yielding no results. Granholm also highlights the advantage of converting permits for oil or gas exploration into geothermal licenses, reducing paperwork and delays.

Geothermal energy has several environmental benefits. The Energy Department states that EGS uses fewer chemical additives than traditional fracking and does not release hydrocarbons. Furthermore, geothermal energy provides a consistent flow of energy regardless of weather conditions. It offers a steady and reliable source of power.

Cost is another significant factor in the adoption of geothermal energy. The US government estimates that the cost per megawatt hour (MWh) will decrease from the current range of $70 to $100 to $45 by 2035. Leveraging existing drilling technology makes geothermal energy development quicker and more cost-effective. Jigar Shah of the Energy Department's loan office explains that by modifying drill bits, they were able to adapt oil and gas operation models for geothermal energy.

While geothermal drilling projects have the potential to cause seismic activity, the US Energy Department ensures that all funded projects follow a mitigation protocol to address induced seismicity. Research on the issue is also being funded. Despite the risks, several start-ups in the US and Canada have raised significant investments and are competing in the geothermal energy market.

As demand for geothermal energy grows, major companies like Google, Microsoft, and Nucor have announced their intention to purchase geothermal energy. This demonstrates the willingness of private sector firms to pay a premium for clean energy. However, the geothermal energy market is still in its early stages, awaiting the first successful commercial facility. Once this milestone is achieved, other companies are likely to follow suit.

In conclusion, geothermal energy has the potential to become a significant player in the US energy sector. Technological advancements, lower costs, and environmental benefits are driving its growth. With government support and private sector interest, geothermal energy could play a vital role in the transition to a greener future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/a-worker-operates-a-dr.jpg,2024-03-25 04:59:03,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninaseega/2024/03/25/the-planet-is-going-bankrupt-human-survival-depends-on-managing-climate-risk/,We must invest in climate disaster risk,"2023 has been a year filled with extreme weather events, from soaring temperatures to devastating wildfires. Climate change has played a significant role in intensifying these events, yet our climate models have failed to keep pace with this alarming reality.

The first European climate risk assessment, released by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in March, reveals that Europe has experienced a faster rate of warming than any other continent since the industrial revolution. However, the continent is ill-prepared for the future climate risks it will face. The report highlights crop loss, heat stress, damage to coastal and marine ecosystems, and loss of biodiversity and carbon sinks due to wildfires and flooding as areas of concern. Unfortunately, the report's predictions may be an underestimation, as they are based on limited and outdated climate models.

Another report, the Scorpion report, emerged during the same week as the EEA study. While it received less attention, it offers a more realistic and crucial perspective on climate change. Unlike the EEA report, which focuses on empirical data, the Scorpion report draws attention to ""tail risks"" - high-impact, low-probability events such as natural disasters and extreme flooding. These tail risks are not adequately accounted for in current risk models.

Climate models rely on outdated averages, failing to reflect the current reality of climate change. For instance, extreme flooding, which used to occur once in a century, now happens every five years. The Scorpion report argues that the probability distribution of climate-related events has shifted, meaning that what was once considered a tail risk is now a mainstream scenario. To avoid what the report refers to as ""planetary insolvency,"" where the world runs out of financial resources when they are most needed, we must incorporate these risks into our models.

The EEA report has several concerning omissions. It emphasizes the need to limit warming in Europe to 1.5 degrees Celsius, yet predicts that Europe will experience 3 degrees of warming by mid-century, twice the global average. Additionally, the report fails to address the potential impact of climate risk on private finance investments, focusing solely on public finance implications.

Both the EEA and Scorpion reports stress the importance of considering cascading and systemic effects. Climate change acts as a threat multiplier, causing changes in natural and economic systems that can have far-reaching consequences. The Scorpion report warns that, even without accounting for cascading effects, there is a 5% chance of annual insured losses exceeding $200 billion in the next decade, with total losses approaching $1 trillion. To put this in perspective, this is four times the losses incurred during the 2021 German and Belgian floods.

However, this does not mean we should succumb to panic. Instead, we must heed the recommendations of the Scorpion report and take realistic action to assess the impacts of climate change. We need to identify tipping points that could lead to worst-case scenarios and establish a framework for planetary solvency. This framework would ensure that the necessary funds for mitigating and adapting to climate change will always be available.

Implementing new modeling approaches will undoubtedly be challenging, but it is achievable if policymakers and scientists collaborate. Now is not the time for division or political polarization. The future of humanity is at stake, and we must prioritize finding solutions over winning elections or scoring political points. It is time to take decisive action to safeguard our planet and secure a sustainable future for generations to come.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66017015f07c989656c8d45a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 08:38:39,Innovation,Innovation
