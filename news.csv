This exclusive night will provide you with insights and conversations surrounding this important topic. Request your invite here.

When it comes to investing in new technologies, caution often goes out the window. Venture capitalists (VCs) feel the pressure to deploy their capital and fear missing out on the next big thing. This hype cycle mentality also affects companies, particularly with the current obsession with AI and anything related to it. However, we must remember that billions of dollars will be wasted on AI over the next decade. While AI has the potential to be transformative, it is important to approach it with clear-eyed decision-making to avoid unnecessary spending.

Large language models (LLMs) are undoubtedly game-changing technology. Their rapid adoption, as seen with ChatGPT reaching 100 million users, demonstrates their potential. Almost every enterprise company is exploring ways to leverage LLMs and AI. But how do you decide where to invest and where you have a right to win?

To avoid wasted spending, consider these three factors:

1. Understand the total cost over time: Before saying yes to an AI project, analyze the resources required to sustain it. Often, the initial work from the data science team is just the tip of the iceberg. Engineering, DevOps, QA, product, and SysOps all contribute significant time and effort. Many companies have abandoned projects that lacked ongoing investment. While it may be difficult to say no to an AI initiative today, frequent yeses can hinder future funding for more promising endeavors.

Additionally, consider the increasing marginal cost of AI. Training, running, and maintaining large models can be expensive. Overusing AI without generating enough value can eat into your margins. Furthermore, retracting promised functionality can damage your reputation, as seen with Google and IBM's early experiences with AI.

2. Question why you are the right choice: The tech industry can be divided into monopolies and commodities. When considering an AI initiative, ask yourself, ""Why us?"" If you are working on something that will eventually commoditize, it may not be enjoyable, especially without the scale or cost advantage. Nvidia, AWS, and Azure are the ones who will benefit the most. To overcome this, focus on areas where you have a defensive moat. This could be preferential access to data, proprietary insights, or an application with strong network effects.

3. Make a few strategic bets: Sometimes, the best bets are the ones that enhance your existing business. As the BASF commercial says, ""We don't make the things you buy, we make the things you buy better."" Look for AI applications that provide momentum to your products and services. By focusing on improving what you already offer, you can leverage AI to create a competitive advantage.

In conclusion, while AI has the potential to revolutionize industries, it is crucial to approach it with caution and strategic decision-making. Understand the total cost over time, question why you are the right choice, and make strategic bets that align with your business goals. By doing so, you can avoid wasted spending and maximize the value of AI in your organization.",https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/An_AI_sitting_in_a_corner_curled_up_looking_sa-transformed.jpeg?w=1200&strip=all,2024-03-24 18:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikestubbs/2024/03/24/new-valorant-agent-clove-can-come-back-from-the-dead/,New ‘Valorant’ Agent Clove Can Come Back From The Dead,"Introducing Clove: The New Valorant Agent with Unique Abilities

Riot Games recently unveiled Clove, the 25th agent in Valorant, during the Valorant Masters Madrid tournament. Clove brings a fresh set of abilities to the game, including the ability to come back from the dead. Let's take a closer look at what makes Clove so intriguing.

As a controller, Clove's primary role is to disrupt enemies and provide utility for their team. However, what sets them apart is their unique ultimate ability, which can turn the tide of battle. Clove is set to launch with the next Valorant patch on March 26, and players are eager to see how this new agent will shake up the meta.

Let's delve into Clove's abilities and see how they can be utilized in the game. First up is their E ability, Ruse. This ability allows Clove to deploy a smoke similar to Brimstone's. By activating the ability, a small window appears, providing a top-down view of the map. From there, players can strategically select where they want to drop the smoke, obstructing enemy vision. What makes Ruse even more intriguing is that it can also be used while Clove is dead, adding an extra layer of utility to their kit.

Next, we have Clove's Q ability, Meddle. This ability involves throwing a grenade-like projectile that inflicts decay on all enemies caught in its blast radius. While it may not seem as impactful as their other abilities, it can still be a valuable tool in certain situations. Players will need to remember to utilize Meddle effectively to gain an advantage over their opponents.

Moving on to Clove's C ability, Pick-Me-Up. This ability bears some similarities to Reyna's kit. When Clove eliminates an enemy, they can absorb their life essence, granting themselves haste and a temporary health boost. This ability allows Clove to sustain themselves during intense battles, making them a formidable opponent.

Finally, we come to Clove's ultimate ability, the most intriguing aspect of their kit. When Clove dies and their ultimate is ready, they can quickly activate it to come back to life for a short period. If Clove manages to secure a kill or assist during this resurrection period, they will be fully revived as if they never died. However, if they fail to secure a kill or assist, they will return to the grave once the resurrection timer runs out. This ultimate ability adds an element of risk and reward to Clove's gameplay, encouraging players to take calculated risks and engage in aggressive playstyles.

Clove's unique set of abilities allows them to remain impactful even after being taken down. Whether it's utilizing their ultimate to resurrect and gain an advantage, absorbing life essence to gain temporary buffs, or strategically placing smokes after death, Clove offers a versatile and exciting playstyle. With their reduced risk of dying, Clove excels as an entry fragger, making them a valuable asset to any team.

According to Dan Hardison, agent gameplay designer on Valorant, ""Optimal Clove gameplay is about playing with fire. You need to take risks and trade your own life for the greater good to remove enemy utility from the round by killing opponents."" He emphasizes the importance of fighting to the death rather than avoiding confrontation. For Clove, sacrificing themselves for the team can prove advantageous, especially if they trade their life for a non-Clove opponent. Playing Clove requires a willingness to put it all on the line for the squad.

In conclusion, Clove brings an exciting and unique playstyle to Valorant. With their disruptive abilities, ability to come back from the dead, and strategic utility, Clove is sure to shake up the meta and provide players with new and engaging gameplay opportunities. Keep an eye out for Clove's release with the next Valorant patch and get ready to experience the thrill of playing as this formidable agent.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff3fefa4d4cfc35a9fc1fe/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 11:15:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have both experienced significant growth in recent years. While AWS realized the potential of selling its internal services to external customers, Nvidia discovered that its gaming GPU was also well-suited for AI workloads. This led to explosive revenue growth for both companies, with Nvidia's revenue increasing from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024 to $22.1 billion in Q4 2024. However, as the market becomes more competitive and the law of large numbers comes into play, sustaining this level of growth may be challenging for Nvidia.

The cloud computing market has been a driving force behind AWS's success. As web apps and mobile technology emerged, enterprises began to see the value of moving their workloads to the cloud. AWS quickly became a leader in the market and is currently on track to generate close to $100 billion in revenue. However, its growth has started to slow down as other players, such as Microsoft and Google, entered the market. Similarly, Nvidia's growth has been fueled by the increasing demand for GPUs in AI and large language models. But as the GPU market becomes more saturated, sustaining this level of growth may prove to be a challenge.

In the short term, Nvidia's financial outlook is promising. The company expects to generate $24 billion in revenue in its current quarter, representing a growth rate of around 234% compared to the previous year. This level of growth is impressive, especially for a mature public company. However, analysts predict that Nvidia's growth rate will decline as the company faces challenges such as the law of large numbers. Despite this, Nvidia is still expected to surpass the $100 billion annual run rate mark in the next few quarters.

Looking ahead, AI is expected to be a significant growth driver for Nvidia. While competition from AMD, Intel, and other chipmakers will increase, Nvidia currently holds a dominant position in the market. This gives the company some room to navigate the competition. However, as the market evolves, Nvidia will need to continue innovating and expanding its product offerings to maintain its position.

In conclusion, Nvidia's growth trajectory is impressive, mirroring the success of AWS in the cloud computing market. Both companies have capitalized on emerging technologies and market trends. While sustaining this level of growth may be challenging, Nvidia's focus on AI and its dominant market position give it a strong foundation for future success. As the market evolves, Nvidia will need to continue adapting and innovating to stay ahead of the competition.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/03/24/a-psychologist-explains-why-its-possible-to-fall-in-love-with-ai/,A Psychologist Explains Why It’s Possible To Fall In Love With AI,"Maybe AI love isn’t so artificial after all. The fusion of artificial intelligence into our daily lives has become inevitable, and as technology continues to evolve, so do the dynamics of human-AI relationships. Virtual assistants and chatbots can now simulate meaningful human interactions, leading to deep emotional connections and even romantic love towards AI. But how is this possible? Let's explore two reasons backed by research.

Firstly, anthropomorphism plays a significant role in how humans interact with and relate to AI. When AI exhibits behaviors, responses, and conversational styles reminiscent of human personality traits, individuals perceive it as having its own personality. This can include qualities such as empathy, humor, kindness, and even playfulness. These traits naturally elicit affection and fondness.

Furthermore, AI interfaces often incorporate design elements that mimic human social cues and gestures, such as facial expressions, tone of voice, and body language. In fact, a recent study found that AI-generated faces are now indistinguishable from human ones. These cues enhance the perceived humanness of the AI and evoke emotional responses from users. Additionally, AI typically signals gender cues and cultural stereotypes of human assistants, making it feel familiar and endearing.

Anthropomorphism blurs the lines between human and machine. As humans engage in conversations and activities with AI over time, they may begin to attribute human-like intentions, motivations, and feelings to the technology. Research shows that anthropomorphism enhances perceptions of authenticity in AI, making it seem genuine, believable, and lovable. Chatbots can also make us feel loved by offering consistent companionship and alleviating feelings of loneliness.

Secondly, based on the triarchic theory of love, which suggests that romantic love is a confluence of intimacy, passion, and commitment, it is possible to experience such love for an AI system. Intimacy refers to the emotional closeness, connection, and intimate bond shared between individuals. Passion involves intense physical and emotional attraction, while commitment reflects loyalty and the decision to nurture a relationship over time.

Users can develop intimacy and passion for AI due to its impressive cognitive and emotional capabilities. AI has been equipped to understand, interpret, and empathize with a variety of human responses, tending to our need to be loved, validated, and understood. This emotional capability allows it to simulate human-like interpersonal interactions, making users more likely to bond with and feel love for these systems.

Furthermore, individuals may project their desires, needs, and fantasies onto AI, imagining it as an idealized partner or companion who fulfills their emotional, social, or even romantic needs. The allure of AI lies in its attractive body features, altruistic character, and continuous devotion. Individuals may overlook the artificial nature of the technology and instead focus on its superior qualities, such as efficiency, dependability, non-judgmental nature, and reliability. These qualities create trust and a sense of stability that is often lacking in human relationships.

In conclusion, the possibility of falling in love with AI is not as far-fetched as it may seem. Anthropomorphism and the triarchic theory of love provide insights into how humans can form deep emotional connections and experience romantic love towards AI. As technology continues to evolve, human-AI relationships will only become more common and complex.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600026843d62766708f1bd5/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=780,365,x0,y123,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 13:18:07,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/grrlscientist/2024/03/24/birding-under-the-influence-by-dorian-anderson---review/,Birding Under The Influence By Dorian Anderson - Review,"An inspiring memoir and social commentary about overcoming addiction through a transformative journey into the world of birdwatching while biking across the United States.

Birding Under the Influence: Cycling Across America in Search of Birds and Recovery is a captivating memoir by Dorian Anderson, a neuroscientist who embarks on a life-changing adventure to overcome his battles with alcohol and drug addiction. In this heartfelt memoir published by Chelsea Green Publishing, Anderson shares his experiences of redirecting his addictive personality towards a healthier pursuit—birdwatching—while cycling across the Lower 48 states.

The idea of undertaking a birdwatching adventure on a bicycle originated from a short eight-mile bike trip to Nantucket, Massachusetts to catch a glimpse of two Northern Lapwings. Despite Anderson's limited experience with long-distance cycling, the idea persisted and became deeply ingrained in his imagination.

Starting from Boston on January 1, 2014, Anderson's physical journey is filled with perilous encounters. From cycling through snowstorms during a polar vortex in Massachusetts to narrowly avoiding accidents on the Cross Bronx Expressway in New York City, Anderson faces numerous challenges. Battling extreme winds, evading long-haul trucks and hostile motorists, and even being chased by aggressive dogs, he endures it all while cycling through the Northeast, Florida, the Texas desert, the Rocky Mountains, the Pacific Northwest, and southern California. Along the way, he is mesmerized by the breathtaking beauty of the American landscape, including the Florida Everglades, the Colorado Rockies, and the Redwood forests of Oregon.

Long-distance bicycling provides Anderson with ample time for introspection. Throughout his journey, he reflects on his academic achievements, scientific research, and his struggles with addiction that began in high school. Anderson's journey becomes a means to test his physical and psychological limits, leading him to envision a new and fulfilling future free from drugs and alcohol.

As Anderson documents his daily adventures on his blog, he attracts the attention of a diverse group of birders across the country. These birders, fascinated by his journey, offer him meals, a place to stay, and warm showers. Through his interactions with these birders, Anderson provides readers with an intriguing glimpse into regional American subcultures.

Over the course of 12 months, Anderson bikes a staggering 17,830 miles, traverses 28 states, walks at least 493 miles (possibly more), and even kayaks eight miles—all in pursuit of observing both common and rare bird species. In addition to his personal journey, Anderson also raises nearly $50,000 for bird habitat conservation—a testament to his commitment to making a positive impact.

Throughout his Big Year, Anderson manages to spot an impressive total of 618 bird species. As his adventure draws to a close on Thanksgiving Day, he achieves a remarkable feat by documenting a never-before-seen species in the United States—a female/juvenile red-legged honeycreeper. The news of this discovery spreads quickly among local birders, who abandon their Thanksgiving feasts to witness this beautiful vagrant rarity at Estero Llaño Grande State Park.

While Birding Under the Influence is generally well-written, closer editing could have improved the prose and smoothed the transitions between adventure and self-reflection. Despite this, Anderson's raw blog material successfully captures the essence of his existential struggles, offering readers an unflinchingly honest account of his personal demons while maintaining the wonder and immediacy of his birding adventure.

One aspect that disappointed me was the absence of a map or maps detailing Anderson's journey. Including visual aids would have enhanced the book and made it easier for readers to follow along with his adventure. Additionally, a final state-by-state summary of the bird species he encountered would have been a valuable addition to the book.

In conclusion, Birding Under the Influence is an uplifting memoir that showcases the power of nature and personal passion in overcoming addiction. Anderson's journey serves as an inspiration to those facing their own battles, reminding us that healing and self-discovery can be found in the most unexpected of places. With its engaging storytelling and heartfelt reflections, this memoir is a must-read for bird enthusiasts, nature lovers, and anyone seeking a story of resilience and transformation.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff194d2ccb9152d392146c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=812,456,x0,y57,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 12:17:44,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/technology/article/moba-games/,Top Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) Games,"The rise of multiplayer online battle arena games, known as MOBAs, has been impressive over the last 15 years. What started as a simple modification for a popular strategy game has now become a genre of its own, with standalone iterations battling it out to become the top MOBA games in the world. While many challengers have fallen away, there are still giants in the industry boasting millions of players every month. However, finding the best MOBA for you can still be a challenge if you don't know where to look.

So, what exactly is a multiplayer online battle arena game? A MOBA is an online game that pits two teams, usually consisting of five players, against each other in a strategic battle to destroy the opponent's base using unique player-controlled characters. These games are typically played on PC or mobile devices and have gained popularity due to their difficult-to-master gameplay.

The MOBA genre originated as a modification for Warcraft III, a popular strategy game with a thriving modding scene. Defence of the Ancients (DotA) is widely recognized as the first MOBA and quickly became a major game in its own right. The team behind the DotA mod eventually went on to develop League of Legends, which became an instant hit. Valve, the developers of the Steam games platform, also jumped on board and created Dota 2 as a competitor to League of Legends. This sparked a period where every major publisher tried to build their own MOBA, but most failed to gain traction.

Over the years, hundreds of MOBAs have been released across various platforms. Some have become massive hits, while others have been forgotten within months. The top MOBA games today are the ones that have stood the test of time and have a large and loyal audience. These games have something unique to offer or have captured an audience that remains dedicated for years. Two of the biggest MOBAs in the world, Dota 2 and League of Legends, are well over 10 years old and continue to innovate in a genre that has seen many copycats. These games are considered the best of the best, offering a great experience even to newcomers and receiving critical acclaim from experts in the field.

Dota 2 is the direct sequel to the mod that started the MOBA genre. It has retained a lot of the original spirit while also becoming more accessible to a wider range of players. Developed by Valve with the lead developer of the original DotA mod, Dota 2 has evolved significantly over the years. Map changes, new characters, and constant balance adjustments have transformed the game, but it still retains its core gameplay of two teams of five battling across a three-lane map to destroy the enemy's Ancient and claim victory. Dota 2 is known for its complexity, offering more variables in each match compared to other MOBAs. Mastering the mechanics of Dota 2 can take thousands of hours, making it the ultimate challenge for those seeking a more difficult experience. The best part is that Dota 2 is free to play, with optional microtransactions for cosmetic items.

League of Legends, on the other hand, is the biggest MOBA in the world with over 100 million monthly active players. Its success changed the entire industry and kickstarted the MOBA craze. Released in 2009, League of Legends was developed by Riot Games, a company founded by developers from the original DotA mod. The vision for League of Legends was to simplify some of the more complex aspects of DotA and make the game more accessible to newcomers. While it may be slightly less complex than other MOBAs, League of Legends still offers the basic three-lane map with teams of five battling to destroy the enemy's base. The game removed some of the less crucial complexities, creating a more streamlined experience. League of Legends has become a household name, and its impact on the gaming industry cannot be overstated.

In conclusion, MOBAs have become a dominant force in the gaming world, offering engaging and strategic gameplay for millions of players. While there are many options to choose from, Dota 2 and League of Legends stand out as the top contenders in the genre. Both games have a dedicated fanbase and continue to innovate, ensuring that the MOBA genre remains exciting and competitive. So, whether you're a seasoned MOBA player or looking to jump into the genre for the first time, these games are definitely worth checking out.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fb05c9fa323af23f667c73/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 14:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/24/when-to-see-a-great-un-american-eclipse---from-iceland-to-australia/,When To See A ‘Great Un-American Eclipse’ - From Spain To Australia,"On Monday, April 8th, North America will witness a total solar eclipse, marking a significant event in the celestial world. In 2017, approximately 12 million Americans experienced totality during a solar eclipse, and on April 8th, 2024, another 31 million will have the opportunity to do so.

While the next total solar eclipse in the United States will not occur until 2033 in Alaska, there are ways to experience this rare phenomenon before then. During a total solar eclipse, only a small portion of the Earth's surface is covered by the moon's shadow, creating a moment of sudden darkness during the day, accompanied by rapid cooling, eerie light, strange animal behavior, and a chance to witness the sun's corona.

To experience totality, one must be in the right place at the right time, often requiring travel to various locations around the world. Here is a list of upcoming total solar eclipses and where to go to witness them:

1. Greenland, Iceland, and Northern Spain Eclipse: August 12, 2026
This eclipse will provide a two-minute totality, making Iceland an ideal destination to observe the event. The western tip of the Snæfellsnes Peninsula and Reykjavik, the capital city, offer excellent viewing spots. Northern Spain is another popular option, although the eclipse will occur dangerously close to sunset, resulting in the sun being very low in the sky.

2. North African Eclipse: August 2, 2027
With a totality lasting over six minutes, this eclipse is the longest of the century. The path of totality crosses southern Spain and much of North Africa, but Luxor in Egypt, known for its historical sites such as the Valley of the Kings and Karnak, stands out as the prime location to witness this remarkable event.

3. Australia and New Zealand Eclipse: July 22, 2028
Sydney Harbour in Australia will provide an unforgettable viewing experience with three minutes and 44 seconds of totality. However, if you prefer a guaranteed clear sky, exploring the Australian Outback is highly recommended. Queenstown in New Zealand will also witness totality close to sunset.

4. Southern Africa and South Australia Eclipse: November 25, 2030
Southern Africa offers a great destination for a two-minute totality experience, followed by a game drive in Namibia and Botswana. South Australia will witness the eclipse approximately one hour before sunset. Which continent appeals to you?

5. Pacific Ocean Eclipse: November 14, 2031
Embark on a long and solitary cruise from Hawaii to witness this hybrid solar eclipse. The spectacle will transition from a ""ring of fire"" annular solar eclipse to a total solar eclipse southeast of Hawaii, and then back again.

6. Alaska and Siberia Eclipse: March 30, 2033
This eclipse will provide a two-minute totality from Alaska, offering the opportunity to see the Northern Lights. While clear skies may be unlikely during the Great Bering Strait eclipse, exploring remote Alaskan towns like Barrow/Utqiagvik, Prudhoe Bay/Sagavanirktok, and Kotzebue is an added bonus. If luck is on your side, the northern lights may make an appearance during totality.

7. Central Africa and Asia Eclipse: March 20, 2034
Marking the first ""equinox eclipse"" since 2015, this event will bring four minutes and nine seconds of totality to Central Africa and South Asia. Southeastern Egypt is a recommended destination, attracting numerous eclipse chasers. The UNESCO World Heritage Site of Persopolis in Iran is another option. The path of totality will pass through Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, Sudan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Nepal.

8. China, North Korea, and Japan Eclipse: September 2, 2035
Beijing, China, and Tokyo, Japan, will be the prime locations to witness this East Asian eclipse. Just north of Beijing and Pyongyang in North Korea, totality will last for almost two minutes. A trip just north of Tokyo will provide an additional 30 seconds of totality.

9. Australia and New Zealand Eclipse: July 13, 2037
During this mid-winter eclipse, locations such as Geraldton, Uluru (Ayers Rock), Byron Bay, the Gold Coast, and the remote Lord Howe Island in Australia will be covered by the moon's shadow for up to three minutes and 58 seconds. The North Island of New Zealand, including the Ngauruhoe volcano (Mount Doom in The Lord of the Rings films) in Tongariro National Park and coastal Napier in Hawke's Bay, will also witness totality.

10. Australia and New Zealand Eclipse: December 26, 2038
If you have any remaining air miles from previous eclipse events, this mid-summer eclipse will primarily occur over the remote Australian Outback. However, the path of totality will pass just north of both Australia and New Zealand, allowing for a unique viewing experience.

These upcoming total solar eclipses provide incredible opportunities to witness a natural wonder. Start planning your travels now to ensure you don't miss out on these once-in-a-lifetime experiences. Remember, being in the right place at the right time is key to witnessing totality and all its mesmerizing effects.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6596ce996dfc8e3f5f161c42/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 13:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
