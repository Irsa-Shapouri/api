Here's the good, the bad, and the ugly","DevOps engineering has become an incredibly sought-after job in today's economy. However, it's not a role to be taken lightly. It requires a combination of technological expertise and business acumen. Furthermore, staying relevant in this field demands a commitment to continuous learning, as popular approaches and technologies quickly become outdated.

The demand for DevOps engineers is high, and the salaries are equally impressive. According to estimates from Talent.com, the average salary for a DevOps engineer in the United States is around $134,000 per year. It's no wonder that many professionals are drawn to this line of work.

But what does it take to excel as a DevOps engineer? Brad Morgan, a seasoned DevOps engineer, emphasized the importance of having a strong foundation in technology. He highlighted the need to learn Linux, as it is a fundamental component of any modern DevOps role. Understanding the basics of Linux, being familiar with using the terminal and basic commands, is crucial.

In addition to Linux, Morgan pointed out the significance of bash scripting. DevOps engineers heavily rely on bash scripting to automate Linux commands. It's a valuable skill to possess in this field. 

Cloud skills are another essential aspect of being a DevOps engineer. Morgan suggested focusing on one mainstream cloud provider, such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure, rather than trying to master them all. Learning the nuances of one cloud vendor at a time makes it easier to pick up others in the future.

Becoming a DevOps engineer doesn't require following a formal course of study. In fact, self-learning is often the best path in this field. Morgan emphasized the need for continuous learning and personal growth. DevOps engineers must be open to new ideas and always challenge themselves.

""Homebrew Henry,"" another experienced DevOps engineer, reiterated the importance of constant learning in this field. The DevOps ecosystem is vast and ever-evolving. Tools and frameworks that were popular yesterday may be replaced by new alternatives. Therefore, DevOps engineers must dedicate their free time to studying and staying up to date.

Even with more experience, learning never stops for a DevOps engineer. It's an aspect of the job that many professionals love. With the rapid pace of development and the introduction of AI tools like ChatGPT, DevOps engineering today will not be the same as it was two or three years ago.

Infrastructure management is a significant part of a DevOps engineer's role. If you don't enjoy managing infrastructure, you may struggle in this field. DevOps engineers spend a considerable amount of time setting up, configuring, and maintaining the cloud infrastructure that supports various applications. This involves dealing with servers, databases, networks, and security on a daily basis. It can be both challenging and rewarding for those who are passionate about it.

While DevOps engineering may not scratch the coding itch in the same way as building customer-facing applications, there are opportunities for professionals to transition between software engineering and DevOps. It's not a one-way street, and individuals can explore both paths.

Lastly, it's important to consider the business side of DevOps. Unrealistic expectations are often placed on DevOps engineers, with businesses hoping that hiring a few engineers will magically solve all their problems. However, it's crucial for management to understand that DevOps is a complex field that requires time, effort, and a comprehensive understanding of both technology and business.

In conclusion, becoming a successful DevOps engineer requires a strong foundation in technology, a commitment to continuous learning, and an understanding of the business side of DevOps. It's a challenging yet rewarding field with plenty of opportunities for growth and development.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/e4d3d8d263eb00323161fcf2566ad35a3fe52282/2024/03/25/1b8b924e-2629-43c2-b416-1b990e262786/gettyimages-1319039490.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation

While they may be helpful in many areas, their knowledge and accuracy regarding celestial events leave much to be desired. So, if you're looking for reliable information about total solar eclipses, it's best to turn to other sources.

Let's start by addressing the accuracy of ChatGPT's responses. When asked about the next total solar eclipse, its initial answer was incorrect, stating that it had already occurred on December 14, 2020. In reality, the next total solar eclipse will take place on April 8, 2024, and will be visible from parts of North America, including Mexico, the United States, and Canada. Fortunately, ChatGPT eventually provided the correct information, but its inconsistent and sometimes erroneous replies are concerning.

To explore this further, I asked ChatGPT about the next total solar eclipse after April 8, 2024. Surprisingly, it responded with an incorrect date of August 23, 2044, omitting the actual next eclipse on August 12, 2026, which will occur in Greenland, Iceland, and Spain. Between April 8, 2024, and August 23, 2044, there will be a remarkable 13 total solar eclipses, but ChatGPT seemed to focus solely on events happening in the contiguous United States.

Continuing the inquiry, I asked ChatGPT about the next total solar eclipse after August 23, 2044. To my disappointment, it provided another incorrect response, stating that it would occur on March 20, 2053. In reality, the next eclipse after August 23, 2044, will take place on August 12, 2045, and is widely regarded as the ""Greatest American Eclipse."" While a solar eclipse is indeed set for March 20, 2053, it will not be a total solar eclipse. These inaccuracies and inconsistencies in ChatGPT's responses raise concerns about its reliability as a source of information on total solar eclipses.

On the other hand, Gemini, Google's new AI model engine, formerly known as Bard, proves to be more reliable in this regard. When asked about the next total solar eclipse, Gemini consistently provides the correct answer of April 8, 2024, and even adds a personalized note mentioning that it will be visible in the inquirer's location. Multiple attempts to confirm this information yielded the same accurate response from Gemini, highlighting its superiority over ChatGPT.

It's worth noting that the lack of knowledge displayed by AI chatbots regarding celestial events is particularly worrying for eclipse chasers and enthusiasts. These individuals rely on accurate and up-to-date information to plan their travels and make the most of these extraordinary phenomena. Unfortunately, ChatGPT and similar chatbots are not reliable sources for this purpose.

For the most recent and comprehensive information about total solar eclipses, including travel and lodging options, it is recommended to consult trustworthy sources dedicated to astronomy and celestial events. These sources often have articles and updates specifically tailored to eclipse enthusiasts, ensuring accurate and reliable information.

In conclusion, while AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini may excel in various areas, their knowledge and accuracy regarding total solar eclipses are lacking. To obtain reliable and up-to-date information about these celestial events, it is advisable to seek out specialized sources dedicated to astronomy. Remember to always double-check the information and rely on trusted resources to ensure an enjoyable and unforgettable eclipse experience.

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-household-robots-common.html,Engineering household robots to have a little common sense,"Robots are becoming increasingly skilled at performing household tasks, thanks to their ability to imitate human actions. However, one major challenge is that robots often struggle to handle unexpected disruptions or errors that occur during a task. To address this issue, engineers at MIT have developed a method that combines robot motion data with the knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to give robots a sense of common sense and enable them to adjust to disruptions within a task.

The researchers' approach involves breaking down a complex task into subtasks and allowing the robot to adjust its actions accordingly. For example, in the case of scooping marbles from one bowl and pouring them into another, the robot needs to perform multiple subtasks such as reaching into the bowl, scooping the marbles, and transporting them to the empty bowl. If a disruption occurs during any of these subtasks, the robot can use the information from the LLM to self-correct its actions and continue with the task, without having to start from the beginning.

The key to this approach lies in the use of LLMs, which are deep learning models that process large amounts of text data to establish connections between words, sentences, and paragraphs. By prompting an LLM to generate a logical list of subtasks based on a given task, the researchers found that the model can provide valuable guidance for the robot. For instance, if asked about the actions involved in scooping marbles, the LLM might produce a sequence of verbs like ""reach,"" ""scoop,"" ""transport,"" and ""pour.""

To connect the LLM's instructions with the robot's physical actions, the researchers developed an algorithm that maps the natural language labels for each subtask to the robot's position in physical space or an image of its state. This process, known as ""grounding,"" allows the robot to understand what stage it is in a task and make adjustments accordingly.

The implications of this research are significant for the field of robotics. By combining imitation learning with the knowledge from language models, robots can become more adaptable and capable of handling unexpected situations. This approach reduces the need for explicit programming of fixes for every possible failure, making the robot's behavior more flexible and efficient.

The researchers plan to continue refining their method and test it on more complex tasks. They believe that the combination of imitation learning and language models has the potential to revolutionize the field of robotics, enabling robots to perform a wide range of household tasks with ease and efficiency.

In conclusion, MIT engineers have developed a groundbreaking method that allows robots to adjust their actions based on disruptions within a task. By combining robot motion data with the knowledge of large language models, robots can self-correct errors and continue with a task without starting from scratch. This approach has the potential to make household robots more adaptable and efficient, paving the way for a future where robots can seamlessly assist us with various tasks around the house.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/engineering-household.jpg,2024-03-25 09:48:20,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/talpatalon/2024/03/25/former-director-of-mossad-cohen-talks-trust-and-softbanks-investments/,Former Director Of Mossad Cohen Talks Trust And SoftBank’s Investments,"Building Trust: Insights from the Former Head of Mossad

Trust is a concept that holds different meanings for each individual. For some, it is a deep connection that is built over time, while for others, it is a fleeting facade that can be manipulated and broken. Yossi Cohen, the former head of Mossad, Israel's Intelligence Agency, falls into the latter category. Cohen, who is now heading SoftBank Investment Advisers' activities in Israel, believes that trust is a technique that can be mastered.

""In the espionage world, you are an actor on a stage, surrounded by many different actors,"" says Cohen. ""Building trust is pivotal, it is the core of your interaction with your surroundings. You are constantly examined: by border control, the hotel's security officer whom you cannot see, the concierge, the bell boy, the innocent citizen or the terrorist; you must create complete trust around you, you cannot be doubted, even for a split second. In essence, you learn to operate in complete opposite to what everyone sees.""

As an ordinary individual, I have always viewed trust as a genuine and unbreakable bond. However, Cohen's perspective sheds light on the manipulative aspect of trust. According to him, gaining trust is not about acting reliable, but rather being reliable. It requires loyalty to one's people, message, and path. Techniques can only get you through the door, but the rest is up to you.

To illustrate his point, Cohen provides an example. ""If I wanted to create initial trust with you before we ever met, I would first leverage information. Knowledge is power. Then, I would show up at a coffee shop you regularly visit, perhaps bumping into you. You would think it is accidental, but in fact it won't be. The waiter will be my guy, the table I choose will be the one you like, and I will be ordering the exact pastry you like. The initial contact will be completely orchestrated by me, but – and this is important to understand – all of these techniques are not enough. My personality has to take it from there.""

SoftBank, the investment group that Cohen now represents, trusts in his personality and judgement. Cohen joined the company in 2021 with the aim of connecting the ""start-up nation"" of Israel to the tech-oriented investment group. His regional connections also provide an opportunity for SoftBank to strengthen its presence in the Middle East. Since Cohen's arrival, SoftBank has made significant investments in companies like Claroty and Cato Networks. Cohen reveals that they are currently in the final stages of another major investment in Israel, without disclosing specifics. He identifies AI infrastructure and the application of AI technologies to various sectors, including financial services and healthcare, as promising avenues for investments.

Cohen remains unfazed by recent challenges faced by Israel's economy, such as Moody's credit rating cut and the decline in Angel investments. He believes that Israel's economy is highly stable, even during times of crisis. The country has weathered major economic downturns, including the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, with resilience. Its diverse makeup, opinionated nature, and survivor mentality make it a hub for entrepreneurship. Israel boasts an unparalleled number of start-up companies per capita and is a leading force in emerging technologies, particularly in AI-based fields like cybersecurity and HealthTech.

The focus on AI in the Israeli ecosystem aligns with SoftBank's vision. The investment group, which recently returned to profitability, has been investing in AI-supporting technologies. One notable investment is in Blue Laser Fusion, a nuclear fusion startup led by Japanese Nobel prize winner in physics, Shuji Nakamura. The company aims to provide clean energy to meet the growing power demands of AI-based systems.

Brett Rochkind, Managing Partner for SoftBank Investment Advisers, recognizes the resilience and technical skills of the Israeli market. He emphasizes SoftBank's conviction to invest in generationally defining companies that emerge from Israel and its amazing ecosystem.

In conclusion, trust is a complex concept that can be manipulated and built upon technique. Yossi Cohen's insights from his experience in the espionage world shed light on the importance of trust in interactions. SoftBank's trust in Cohen's judgement and regional connections reflects their confidence in his ability to strengthen their presence in the Middle East. Israel's stable economy and focus on AI make it an attractive landscape for investments. SoftBank's alignment with the Israeli ecosystem demonstrates their commitment to investing in groundbreaking companies. Trust, in all its forms, continues to shape the world of business and beyond.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6601629a82438fed58969753/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 11:36:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-large-language-simple-mechanism-knowledge.html,Large language models use a surprisingly simple mechanism to retrieve some stored knowledge,"Large language models, such as those used in AI chatbots, are incredibly complex. Although they are widely used in various applications, such as customer support and language translation, scientists still have limited understanding of how these models work. To gain insights into their inner workings, researchers from MIT and other institutions conducted a study on how these models retrieve stored knowledge.

The researchers made a surprising discovery: large language models often utilize a simple linear function to decode and retrieve stored facts. These models use the same decoding function for similar types of facts. Linear functions, which involve two variables and no exponents, capture the straightforward relationship between these variables.

By identifying linear functions for different facts, the researchers were able to investigate what the model knows about new subjects and where that knowledge is stored within the model. They developed a technique to estimate these simple functions and found that even when a model provides incorrect answers, it often retains the correct information. This approach could potentially be used to identify and correct falsehoods within the model, reducing the occurrence of incorrect or nonsensical responses.

According to Evan Hernandez, an electrical engineering and computer science graduate student and co-lead author of the research paper, ""Even though these models are really complicated, nonlinear functions that are trained on lots of data and are very hard to understand, there are sometimes really simple mechanisms working inside them. This is one instance of that.""

Hernandez collaborated with Arnab Sharma, a computer science graduate student at Northeastern University, along with their advisors and other researchers from MIT, Harvard University, and the Israeli Institute of Technology. The findings will be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024) in Vienna.

Most large language models, also known as transformer models, are neural networks that consist of interconnected nodes or neurons organized into multiple layers. These networks encode and process data, with much of the knowledge stored as relations connecting subjects and objects. For example, the relation ""Miles Davis plays the trumpet"" connects the subject (Miles Davis) to the object (trumpet).

As a transformer model acquires more knowledge, it stores additional facts about a specific subject across different layers. When a user inquires about that subject, the model must decode the most relevant fact to provide a response. The researchers aimed to understand the mechanism by which the model retrieves these facts.

Through a series of experiments, the researchers discovered that despite their complexity, large language models utilize a simple linear function to decode relational information. Each function is specific to the type of fact being retrieved. For example, the model uses one decoding function to output the instrument a person plays and another function to output the state where a person was born.

To estimate these simple functions, the researchers developed a method and computed functions for 47 different relations, such as ""capital city of a country"" and ""lead singer of a band."" Although there are countless possible relations, the researchers selected this subset as it represents the types of facts that can be expressed in this manner.

They tested each function by altering the subject to observe if it could accurately recover the corresponding object information.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/large-language-models-2.jpg,2024-03-25 09:34:06,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-strategy-suppress-strain-propagation-ultrahigh.html,A strategy to suppress strain propagation in ultrahigh-Ni cathodes during fast charging,"Developing advanced and high-performing battery technologies is crucial to meet the demands of the electronics industry and support the widespread use of electric vehicles. One promising approach is the use of nickel (Ni)-rich layered oxides as cathode materials in lithium-ion batteries (LiBs). These cathodes offer several advantages, including increased battery capacity, improved rate capabilities, and reduced fabrication costs. However, they also face limitations such as capacity degradation and structural instability during fast-charging and long-term cycling.

To address these challenges, researchers at Argonne National Laboratory and other institutes worldwide have introduced a strategy to improve the structural stability and reliability of ultrahigh-Ni cathodes. Their approach, described in a paper published in Nature Energy, involves using epitaxial entropy-assisted oxide coating to suppress strain propagation, which is responsible for the cathodes' structural deterioration during battery operation.

In their study, the researchers designed a specialized oxide coating that aligns with the structure of Ni-rich cathodes. These coatings not only enhance the robustness of the cathode materials' surface but also improve ionic conductivity, enabling faster charging of batteries. The coating is based on Wadsley-Roth crystallographic shear phases, which have been found to enhance electrode performance in LiBs. Importantly, these compounds adhere well to Ni-rich cathodes, strengthening their structural stability during prolonged operation and fast-charging.

Through a series of experiments, the researchers evaluated the performance of their coating strategy on Ni-rich layered cathodes. The results were highly promising, as the approach significantly reduced damage to the cathodes, even under fast-charging conditions and after multiple operation cycles. The coating strategy effectively improved fast charging/discharging capabilities, temperature tolerance, and thermal stability of the ultrahigh-Ni cathodes.

The researchers believe that their epitaxial entropy-assisted coating strategy opens up opportunities for surface engineering in the design and development of high-energy and high-power LiBs and beyond. By addressing the challenges of capacity degradation and structural instability, this approach paves the way for more efficient and reliable battery technologies.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/a-strategy-to-suppress.jpg,2024-03-25 09:40:01,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/lucid-motors-1-billion-saudi-arabia-gravity-suv/,Lucid Motors raises another $1 billion from Saudi Arabia as it searches for luxury EV buyers,"Lucid Motors, the luxury electric sedan manufacturer, is securing an additional $1 billion in funding from its primary investor, Saudi Arabia. The aim is to offset the high costs associated with producing and selling their vehicles. Ayar Third Investment, an affiliate of the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund, has agreed to purchase $1 billion worth of Lucid's stock, increasing the Kingdom's ownership stake to approximately 60%.

This recent injection of funds follows Lucid's previous announcement to limit the production of their Air electric vehicles to around 9,000 units this year, a slight increase from last year. In 2023, the company experienced a loss of $2.8 billion but ended the year with nearly $1.4 billion in cash and equivalents. Despite their efforts to reduce prices in order to stimulate sales, Lucid has faced challenges in finding buyers for their expensive Air sedan. Additionally, the company plans to commence production of their electric Gravity SUV at the end of this year.

Interestingly, Lucid's decision to secure more funding from Saudi Arabia comes shortly after CEO Peter Rawlinson expressed caution regarding overreliance on the Kingdom's financial support. Rawlinson emphasized the importance of not assuming there is an endless supply of wealth from the Public Investment Fund, demonstrating his respect for Saudi Arabia as an investor.

The additional funding from Saudi Arabia will alleviate some of the financial burden on Lucid Motors. However, the company will need to continue finding ways to improve their sales and increase market demand for their luxury electric vehicles.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2580.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-25 14:31:52,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/dma-first-formal-probes/,"Apple, Google and Meta face first formal investigations under EU's DMA","What’s the collective noun for investigations on Big Tech? Because the European Union has just announced a pile of probes on gatekeepers designated under the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Alphabet/Google, Apple, and Meta are facing the first formal non-compliance investigations under the bloc’s rebooted ex ante competition rulebook.

Alphabet/Google’s rules on steering in Google Play and its approach to self-preferencing in search results are in the frame. For Apple, the EU is also looking at its rules on steering in the App Store and the design of choice screens for alternatives to its Safari web browser. While Meta’s “pay or consent” model will be scrutinized by the Commission.

In total, five investigations were announced Monday — less than three weeks since the compliance deadline kicked in for the companies earlier this month.

The three gatekeepers, which were designated under the pan-EU market power and contestability regulation last fall, face a formal investigation in these areas to determine whether they are breaching the rulebook, as the Commission suspects. Confirmed violations of the DMA can result in fines of up to 10% of global annual turnover, or even 20% for repeat offenses.

The EU will have up to 12 months to conclude the investigations, per recommended timeframes in the DMA. A preliminary report can be produced within six months. Although senior Commission officials noted Monday that the probes may conclude sooner or could take longer than these guidelines.

The enforcement action by the bloc comes as antitrust scrutiny continues to dial up on the three U.S. firms on home turf, too.

Since the three companies unveiled their DMA compliance plans, there has been a range of criticism that the proposals do not comply with the new EU law.

Google has been accused of seeking to avoid the regulation’s ban on self-preferencing by launching new rich features in search results that compete unfairly with rivals. While Apple’s use of notifications to users warning them of risks of stepping outside its walled garden has been attacked by developers as “scare screens,” among a number of criticisms. And Meta’s ‘pay or be tracked’ tactic has been roundly condemned as exploitative abuse by privacy and consumer rights groups. (Earlier this month, the Commission sent Meta questions about this under the DMA’s sister regulation, the Digital Services Act, too.)

“The Commission has opened proceedings to assess whether the measures implemented by Alphabet and Apple in relation to their obligations pertaining to app stores are in breach of the DMA. Article 5(4) of the DMA requires gatekeepers to allow app developers to “steer” consumers to offers outside the gatekeepers’ app stores, free of charge,” the Commission wrote, saying it’s concerned the pair’s steering measures “may not be fully compliant as they impose various restrictions and limitations,” pointing for example to constraints on developers’ ability to “freely communicate and promote offers and directly conclude contracts.”

On concerns about Google self-preferencing, the EU said the investigation will focus on Google’s vertical search services (e.g., Google Shopping; Google Flights; Google Hotels) and the impact its action may have on similar rival services.

“The Commission is concerned that Alphabet’s measures implemented to comply with the DMA may not ensure that third-party services featuring on Google’s search results page are treated in a fair and non-discriminatory manner in comparison with Alphabet’s own services, as required by Article 6(5) of the DMA,” it wrote.

On Apple, the EU will also look at whether it’s complying with a range of user choice obligations on iOS — including enabling end-users to easily uninstall apps; easily change default settings; and prompt users with choice screens which it says “must effectively and easily allow them to select an alternative default service, such as a browser or search engine on their iPhones.”

“The Commission is concerned that Apple’s measures, including the design of the web browser choice screen, may be preventing users from truly exercising their choice of services within the Apple ecosystem, in contravention of Article 6(3) of the DMA,” it added.

On Meta, the EU said the proceedings will investigate whether its recently introduced “pay or consent” model for EU users complies with Article 5(2) of the DMA, noting that this portion of the regulation “requires gatekeepers to obtain consent from users when they intend to combine or cross-use their personal data across different core platform services.”

“The Commission is concerned that the binary choice imposed by Meta’s ‘pay or consent’ model may not provide a real alternative in case users do not consent, thereby not achieving the objective of preventing the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers,” it said.

Responding to a question about this probe during Monday’s press conference, the EU’s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, said the DMA puts a clear requirement on gatekeepers to offer a free, non-p","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1031626648.jpg?resize=1200,799",2024-03-25 12:10:10,Innovation,Innovation
