https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have experienced remarkable growth in recent years, making them two of the most successful companies in their respective industries. Despite their different origins, both companies have discovered lucrative opportunities that have propelled their revenue to new heights.

AWS, the cloud arm of Amazon, initially realized that it could sell its internal services such as storage, compute, and memory to external customers. This realization led to substantial growth for AWS, which has consistently been a significant revenue driver for Amazon. On the other hand, Nvidia found success by repurposing its gaming-focused GPU for processing AI workloads. This move allowed Nvidia to tap into the growing demand for AI processing power and contributed to its explosive revenue growth.

While AWS has maintained a dominant position in the cloud industry, it has faced increasing competition from Microsoft and Google, who have also entered the market. Similarly, Nvidia has faced competition from other chip makers as the demand for GPUs in AI processing grows. However, both companies were able to establish themselves early on and benefit from being in the right place at the right time.

As web applications and mobile technology emerged in the early 2010s, the cloud became the preferred option for enterprises seeking on-demand resources. This shift in the industry coincided with the rise of AI and the need for GPUs to process AI workloads effectively. As a result, both AWS and Nvidia were able to capitalize on these trends and secure their positions in their respective markets.

Currently, AWS is a highly profitable business, with a run rate close to $100 billion. However, its growth has started to slow down, while Nvidia's growth continues to accelerate. The question now is whether Nvidia can sustain its growth and become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS.

Nvidia's short-term financial outlook is promising, with the company expecting significant revenue growth in the coming quarters. In its recent earnings report, Nvidia projected $24 billion in revenue for the current quarter, representing a 234% increase compared to the same period last year. While the growth rate is expected to decline as the company's revenue ramp stabilizes, Nvidia still anticipates steady growth in the near future.

Analysts predict that Nvidia will generate over $110 billion in revenue for the current fiscal year, an 81% increase from the previous year. Although this growth rate is lower than the previous year's gain of 126%, it is still impressive considering Nvidia's historical revenue figures. The company is expected to continue scaling its revenue past the $100 billion annual run rate mark, indicating significant growth potential.

AI is likely to be the driving force behind Nvidia's continued success in the coming years. While competition from AMD, Intel, and other chipmakers is expected to increase, Nvidia currently holds a dominant position in the market. Market research data shows that Nvidia controls a significant share of the chip market, giving it an advantage over its competitors. However, AMD is steadily gaining traction and becoming a stronger competitor in the GPU market.

In conclusion, both Nvidia and AWS have experienced exceptional growth due to their ability to capitalize on emerging trends in their industries. While AWS has reached a mature stage with slower growth, Nvidia's revenue continues to skyrocket. With its strong position in the chip market and the increasing demand for AI processing, Nvidia is poised for continued success in the years to come.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/24/samsung-s24-ultra-s23-free-update-warning-for-galaxy-android-users/,Samsung Issues Critical Update For Millions Of Galaxy Users,"Samsung Galaxy users, brace yourselves for an important update that you don't want to miss. In addition to the update, there's also a significant change coming to your device soon. Let's dive in and find out what's in store for you.

Samsung has been rolling out its March security update, starting with premium devices and now extending to budget models. For example, carrier-unlocked S21 FE devices in the US recently received the update. Over the past two weeks, various versions of S24s, S23s, and S22s received the update before older and budget variants. It's crucial to ensure that your device downloads and installs the new software as soon as it becomes available for your network and model.

To check if your device is eligible for the monthly update, you can visit a specific link provided by Samsung. This update includes several fixes for Android and Samsung devices. Among these fixes, there are two high-risk vulnerabilities that have been patched. These vulnerabilities could potentially allow malware to take control of your device partially or entirely.

However, the availability of the March update isn't the most significant news. Samsung has finally joined Google's seamless update roadshow after years of avoiding it. Instead of the traditional download, install, and reboot process for updates, Samsung devices will now download and install updates in the background to a secondary partition on the device. The device will then reboot from that partition during the next restart, making it the primary partition. This reduces the downtime during which the device cannot be used normally, with most of the process happening in the background.

Google refers to this process as ""A/B system updates"" or ""seamless updates."" They ensure that a bootable system remains on the disk during an over-the-air (OTA) update, reducing the chances of an inactive device after an update. This, in turn, results in fewer device replacements and reflashes at repair and warranty centers.

You can identify if a seamless update is being installed by observing two progress bars—one for download/install and another for verification. The Galaxy A55 has been the first device to experience Samsung's initial seamless update, but we can expect this feature to roll out widely in the coming months. We eagerly await news on which devices will be next in line.

While it's unclear if this approach will extend across all Samsung models, we've come to expect complexity and the need to consult checklists for updates from the company. The decision to implement seamless updates might have been influenced by the Android Open Source Project's comment suggesting the removal of the legacy alternative after eight years of parallel running. Samsung's delay in adopting this feature has been a sore point for the Android project. However, it's important to note that Android wouldn't be the same without Samsung, so discussions and negotiations have likely taken place behind the scenes.

Although the introduction of seamless updates will reduce the update process to a quick reboot of one or two minutes, it won't simplify the overall Samsung/Android update combination that occurs every month. This combination involves deploying updates across a patchwork quilt of devices.

Nevertheless, this change eliminates the need for user action. Since A/B updates occur in the background, they are no longer user-initiated. To avoid disrupting users, it is recommended to schedule updates when the device is in idle maintenance mode, such as overnight and on Wi-Fi.

While Samsung's update process still has a way to go before it reaches Apple's streamlined approach, we can expect the gap between iPhone and Android devices to narrow as they continue to evolve. Stay tuned for further updates and improvements that will make your Samsung Galaxy experience even better.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65b9d23fb7b46f6467a28780/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2366,1280,x313,y135,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 22:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/25/google-upgrade-samsung-s24-s23-pixel-towards-apple-iphone-15-pro-max/,Google Suddenly Reveals Surprise Android Update That Beats iPhone,"Android and iPhone are constantly competing to provide the best features to their users. Recently, Google has made significant strides in making Android more like iPhone. They have focused on enhancing security, integrating WhatsApp calls into the phone dialer, and even incorporating Apple passes into their wallet. However, Google's latest update not only matches an existing feature on the iPhone but surpasses it in many ways, positioning Android as the leader in this area.

One notable feature that Google has introduced is an emergency satellite service. This feature finally allows Android users to have the same satellite SOS functionality that iPhone users have had for a few years. In fact, Google's offering goes a step further by incorporating a Garmin rescue service into its plan. This is a significant step towards improving the safety and security of Android users.

While Apple's emergency SOS feature is limited to emergencies, Google's latest update aims to bridge the gap. The latest Android 15 developer preview suggests that users will be able to expand their cellular accounts to include a satellite add-on. This would enable core messaging apps to use the satellite network, eliminating the issue of cellular black spots and ensuring uninterrupted connectivity.

Mishaal Rahman, an expert in this field, explains that Android 15 DP2 introduces UI elements to ensure a consistent user experience for devices that support satellite connectivity. Additionally, the update expands platform support for satellite connectivity by introducing a new API that apps can use to detect when a device is connected to a satellite. Furthermore, Android 15 allows SMS/MMS/RCS apps to utilize satellite connectivity for sending and receiving messages.

The ability for SMS/MMS/RCS apps to use satellite connectivity is a game-changer. Some networks have plans to offer low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite connectivity as an account option. This development surpasses our initial expectations, as we believed Google would only introduce a satellite SOS feature. In contrast, Apple's satellite connectivity is limited to specific iPhone models, enabling users to text emergency services, request roadside assistance, and share their location with friends and family when they have no mobile or Wi-Fi coverage.

There were hopes that Android would go even further, with beta code suggesting a satellite messaging option in collaboration with T-Mobile. The potential for this feature became even more apparent when Elon Musk announced that SpaceX achieved download speeds of 17mbps to an unmodified Galaxy S21 Ultra. This implies that smartphones could connect to satellites without requiring special hardware, allowing users to make and receive calls and messages even without a conventional cellular network range nearby. Starlink has been testing such a service, and it is expected to be available in the coming months.

While we eagerly anticipate the future of direct-to-phone satellite connectivity, the integration of messaging services is a great start. The fact that this feature is coming to Android 15 confirms that Google is leading the way, with Apple likely to follow suit. This news comes shortly after the revelation that Gemini might be coming to iPhone, and Apple claiming that the DOJ lawsuit would essentially turn iPhone into Android. It has certainly been an interesting week for smartphone enthusiasts.

Update: Exciting new details regarding Google's plans for satellite messaging have emerged. This news coincides with the groundbreaking announcement that Gemini might be coming to Apple's iPhone, potentially powering many of iOS 18's AI updates. This development not only brings Android and iPhone closer together but also strengthens Google's position within the iPhone ecosystem.

Overall, it is clear that Android is making rapid progress in its quest to catch up with iPhone. While Apple users eagerly await the next OS update in the fall, Android continues to innovate and provide new features to its users. With Android's satellite messaging capabilities and the potential for direct-to-phone satellite connectivity, it seems that Android is leading the way while Apple plays catch-up. The competition between these two smartphone giants is certainly heating up, and users can expect even more exciting developments in the future.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65d79ec3dadcd6b682668331/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 00:06:15,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/anuradhavaranasi/2024/03/25/the-countries-most-and-least-accepting-of-autistic-individuals/,The Countries Most And Least Accepting Of Autistic Individuals,"A recent survey conducted in eight countries revealed that autistic individuals in Japan and Belgium face the lowest levels of societal acceptance. The study included participants from the USA, UK, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, and Belgium. While those living in Canada, the UK, and South Africa reported slightly higher levels of acceptance, only 23.5% of participants across all countries felt that society accepted them as autistic individuals.

The researchers defined autism acceptance as the feeling of being appreciated and recognized as an autistic person, with autism being positively acknowledged by both oneself and others. They also highlighted the fact that autistic individuals are at a higher risk of psychiatric and mental health disorders, as well as a significantly higher risk of premature mortality compared to their non-autistic peers. Depression and anxiety were found to be the most common psychiatric co-morbidities, with prevalence rates as high as 47% and 54% respectively.

The study identified several factors that contribute to the elevated mental health difficulties faced by autistic individuals. One such factor is the higher prevalence of alexithymia, a condition characterized by difficulties in identifying, expressing, and differentiating emotions, among the autistic population. They also emphasized the impact of minority stressors, including everyday discrimination and internalized stigma, that are experienced by autistic individuals as a marginalized minority group.

Despite the challenges faced by autistic individuals, research on their experiences of autism acceptance and its relationship to mental health difficulties has been limited until recently. In the UK, for example, a majority of autistic individuals feel that society does not fully accept them. This lack of acceptance has significant implications for their mental well-being.

One coping mechanism frequently employed by autistic individuals is camouflaging, which involves minimizing the visibility of their autistic traits in social situations. This often means learning strategies to manage social interactions, such as maintaining eye contact and using scripts. Autistic individuals may also suppress stimming behaviors, which are repetitive movements that help them self-regulate in overwhelming environments. Camouflaging is particularly common among autistic women and those with higher levels of autistic traits. However, research suggests that camouflaging may be a risk factor for depression and anxiety in autism, regardless of gender.

Lead author of the study, Connor Keating from the University of Birmingham’s School of Psychology, emphasized the need to combat the stigma surrounding autism and reduce the pressure on autistic individuals to conceal their identity. The findings highlight the importance of creating a more accepting and inclusive society for autistic individuals.

The study was published on March 20, 2024, in PLoS One.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66011516945f390030af66b1/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 03:06:35,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/techcrunch-mobility-the-wheels-are-starting-to-come-off-the-fisker-ev-bus/,TechCrunch Mobility: The wheels are starting to come off the Fisker EV bus,"TechCrunch Mobility is a weekly newsletter focused on the latest developments in the transportation industry. In this edition, we'll cover a range of topics including the Biden Administration's proposed standards for U.S. automakers, EV startups, and recent investment deals. Let's dive in!

The Biden Administration recently released two proposed standards through the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency that will have a significant impact on U.S. automakers and consumers. While these regulations have been adjusted to accommodate the automotive industry, they still impose stricter standards than before.

The DOE introduced a ""petroleum equivalency factor"" that assigns a score to electric vehicles (EVs) under the government's corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. The initial proposal would have made it challenging for automakers to meet the CAFE standards, resulting in substantial fines. Fortunately, the revised proposal provides some relief for automakers.

On the other hand, the EPA released tailpipe standards for model year 2027 to 2032 cars and light-duty trucks. These standards impose more rigorous requirements on automakers, but they also offer flexibility in meeting the rules through various powertrains. The focus is on reducing CO2 emissions, and it doesn't mandate a complete shift to battery electric vehicles (BEVs).

While these regulations don't have a significant impact on established EV startups like Rivian, Tesla, and Lucid, they do pose challenges for legacy automakers. These companies are investing billions in EV development while still relying on profits from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Plug-in hybrids may emerge as winners in this scenario.

Now, let's move on to some exciting news in the industry. Rivian, a prominent EV startup, recently announced a partnership with Tesla. The details of this collaboration are yet to be revealed, but it's a significant development for both companies.

Another noteworthy startup is Candela, which focuses on electric boats. The company raised $25 million in a funding round led by Groupe Beneteau, with participation from EQT Ventures, Ocean Zero LLC, and Kan Dela AB. This investment will fuel Candela's mission to revolutionize the boating industry with sustainable electric solutions.

In other news, Fisker, an EV manufacturer, has been facing financial difficulties. The company's struggles have raised concerns about its future in the market. However, Fisker remains optimistic and is actively seeking new investment opportunities to sustain its operations.

On the investment front, Uber made its first investment in an Africa-founded startup called Moove. Moove is a mobility fintech company that provides vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers. The $100 million funding round, led by Uber, will help Moove expand its services and support Uber's goal of achieving a fully zero-emission fleet by 2040.

Lastly, Amber, a Bay Area startup, secured $3.18 million in a seed funding round. The company specializes in aftermarket Tesla extended warranties, offering peace of mind to Tesla owners. This investment will enable Amber to enhance its warranty offerings and expand its customer base.
