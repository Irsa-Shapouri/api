Welcome back, Strands players! If you're looking for hints, spangram, and answers for Sunday's Strands puzzle, you can find them here. Today, we'll tackle Monday's puzzle and figure out the best strategies to solve it. But first, what do we call Strands players? I like to call Wordle solvers ""Wordlers,"" but we don't have a specific term for Strands players. ""The Stranded"" sounds a bit bleak, doesn't it? Sometimes, when playing this game, I do feel a little stranded. Maybe we can call ourselves ""Stranders."" What do you think?

Now, let's dive into today's puzzle. It was quite tricky, and it took me some time to figure it out. However, I'm sure there are some of you out there who will solve it right away. It's all about context, isn't it? Alright, let's get some extra help to crack this puzzling Strands puzzle!

How to Play Strands

The New York Times' Strands puzzle is a twist on the classic word search. It's currently in beta, so it will continue to be available if enough people play it daily.

Each day, a new game of Strands is presented to players. You'll see a grid of letters, six by eight in size. Your goal is to find a group of words that have something in common. The puzzle provides a clue about the theme of these words. When you find a theme word, it will be highlighted in blue.

In addition to the theme words, you'll also need to find a special word called a spangram. The spangram connects two opposite sides of the grid. While the theme words are not proper names, the spangram can be a proper name. When you find the spangram, it will be highlighted in yellow.

Today's Strands Hint

Before we reveal today's answers, let's take a look at the hint for today's Strands puzzle.

The official theme hint for today's puzzle is ""Sign language."" Here's an extra hint to help you out: ""Constellation.""

Today's Strands Answers

Now, let's move on to the answers for today's Strands puzzle. But before we do, here's your final spoiler alert. If you don't want to see the answers yet, stop scrolling!

The spangram for today's puzzle is ""ASTROLOGY."" Take a look at the grid below to see where the spangram is located.

Once you find the spangram, it becomes easier to find the rest of the words. However, I had some trouble with a couple of them. Here's the full list of answers:

- Bull
- Goat
- Scorpion
- Virgin
- Archer
- Scales
- Twins

Today's puzzle was especially tricky! Yesterday's puzzle had me confused, and today's was just as challenging. I had to use a couple of hints, but they didn't provide much help. First, I found ""Bull,"" and then ""Goat,"" which actually made things more confusing. I thought I was looking for animals, but I had no idea what animals had to do with sign language. I tried ""Stop,"" but that didn't work. Sometimes, you really have to think outside the box.

I then found ""Virgin,"" which only added to my confusion. It wasn't until I stumbled upon ""OLOGY"" that I made some progress. I started looking for words that could fit at the beginning of that word. ""ONTOLOGY"" didn't work. Finally, I spotted it: astrology. Suddenly, all the previous words made sense. They were all constellations! I found ""Archer"" next, followed by ""Twins,"" and finally ""Scorpion,"" although that last one gave me some trouble.

On a side note, I recently watched the film ""Taxi Driver"" for the first time in years, and it was such odd timing. In one scene, when Travis (Robert DeNiro) and Iris (Jodie Foster) meet for breakfast, she talks extensively about astrological signs. What a strange coincidence!

In the end, everything worked out. How did you do on today's Strands puzzle? Let me know on Twitter and Facebook.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have experienced tremendous growth in recent years. Both companies stumbled upon their core businesses by accident. AWS realized it could sell the internal services it had created for itself, while Nvidia discovered that its gaming GPU was well-suited for AI workloads. This led to explosive revenue growth for both companies, with Nvidia's revenue reaching $22.1 billion in Q4 2024.

While AWS has been a consistent revenue driver for Amazon, its growth has slowed down. On the other hand, Nvidia's growth shows no signs of stopping. However, there are concerns about whether Nvidia can sustain this growth and become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS. Nvidia has other businesses, but they are smaller and growing more slowly than its GPU data center business.

In the short term, Nvidia's revenue growth is expected to continue. The company anticipates $24 billion worth of revenue in its current quarter, representing a 234% growth compared to the previous year. However, analysts predict that Nvidia's growth rate will decline in the future. Despite this, the company is still expected to scale its revenue past the $100 billion annual run rate mark for the next several quarters.

AI is expected to be a major driver of growth for Nvidia in the coming years. Although competition from other chipmakers like AMD and Intel is increasing, Nvidia currently controls a significant portion of the market. While competition may intensify, Nvidia is well-positioned to maintain its dominance.

In conclusion, Nvidia has the potential to become the next AWS, but sustaining its growth will be a challenge. However, with the continued demand for AI processing and its strong market position, Nvidia has a promising future ahead.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
