Despite the recent snowfall, the anticipation for next month's PlayStation Plus lineup continues to build. But before we delve into what April might have in store for us, let's not forget that there are still a few days left to enjoy this month's impressive selection of games.

One title that has been on my radar for quite some time is the kung fu action game, Sifu. It's finally made its way onto the PlayStation Plus lineup, and I couldn't be more thrilled. With its release, I can't help but wonder if any of my other predictions (which I'll share shortly) will come true in April.

For those who may be unfamiliar, PlayStation Plus is Sony's monthly membership program that provides access to online gaming. It's important to note that the subscription is not necessary for streaming movies or TV shows on platforms like Netflix, nor is it required for free-to-play games such as Warzone or Fortnite. However, any paid online games do require a subscription.

There are three tiers of PlayStation Plus: Essential, Extra, and Premium. For the purpose of this post, we'll focus solely on the Essential tier's free monthly games. Following a recent price increase, the Essential tier is priced at $79.99 per year, while the Extra and Premium tiers cost $134.99 per year and $159.99 per year, respectively.

Now, let's talk about when Sony typically reveals the upcoming month's PlayStation Plus games. While the general rule is that the new lineup is released on the first Tuesday of the month, the games are usually revealed on the last Wednesday of the previous month. This means that we can expect an announcement for April's lineup on the morning of Wednesday, March 27th, with the new games becoming available on Tuesday, April 2nd.

As of now, there haven't been any leaks or rumors regarding April's PlayStation Plus Essential games. I've scoured the internet for clues but haven't found anything substantial. However, it's safe to assume that it won't be a new release, as there are no games scheduled for release on April 2nd.

While we eagerly wait for official announcements, I'd like to share my own list of predictions for April's lineup. Keep in mind that some of these are more wishful thinking than anything else. Additionally, there's always a chance that we'll see a Simulator or sports game included. Here are a few titles that I have in mind:

1. Assassin's Creed Valhalla
2. Need For Speed Unbound
3. The Outer Worlds
4. Forspoken
5. Demon's Souls
6. The Order 1886
7. The Last Of Us Part 1
8. LEGO Jurassic World
9. Marvel's Midnight Suns
10. Tales of Arise
11. Cult Of The Lamb
12. Little Nightmares 2
13. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor
14. Nier: Automata
15. Elden Ring
16. Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice
17. Metal: Hellsinger
18. Donut County
19. Dead Island 2
20. Metro Exodus
21. Gollum
22. Skull Island: Rise Of Kong
23. The Walking Dead: Destinies

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/24/meet-the-apps-that-tell-you-when-to-take-your-eclipse-glasses-off/,Meet The Apps That Tell You When To Take Your Eclipse Glasses Off,"When it comes to knowing when to remove solar eclipse glasses, many people find themselves unsure. Attending a total solar eclipse can be an exciting and dynamic experience, but it requires careful planning and timing. To fully appreciate the event, you need to be within the path of totality, have clear skies, and know when to remove your eclipse glasses to witness the sun's magnificent corona.

For those who have never experienced a total solar eclipse before, the final step of removing eclipse glasses can be particularly nerve-wracking. However, it's actually quite simple. You remove your eclipse glasses when it starts to get dark. If you are in the path of totality, the darkness will come on quickly as the moon's shadow passes over you. The moment will be unmistakable. On the other hand, if you are not in the path of totality, it will not get dark, so you should continue to use your eclipse glasses.

To make things even easier, there are now smartphone apps available that provide an immersive audio experience during the eclipse. These apps guide you through the entire process, including when to remove your glasses. They also explain various phenomena to watch for, such as shadow bands, Baily's beads, and the diamond ring effect. By using these apps, you can enhance your eclipse-watching experience and ensure that you don't miss any important moments.

The Eclipse Company offers a popular app called ""Pro"" that provides real-time weather updates, cloud forecasts, and a countdown timer with a vibration alert to safely remove your eclipse glasses. It also offers detailed information about local eclipse events and alerts you to when you should be on the lookout for specific phenomena. This app is available for both iOS and Android devices, although the Pro version may require an additional cost.

Another option is the Solar Eclipse Timer App, which is available for iOS and Android. This app uses geolocation to confirm whether you are within the path of totality or not. It then guides you through the contact times and explains various eclipse phenomena. This app is particularly popular among photographers and even includes a special ""Photographer's Mode"" developed with the help of ex-NASA eclipse calculator and photographer Fred Espenak.

For iOS users, there is also the One Eclipse app, developed by the non-profit organization Astronomers Without Borders and Simulation Curriculum. This app not only allows you to simulate the eclipse from your location or anywhere on Earth but also supports a recycling program for eclipse glasses in underserved communities. It provides an interactive map with precise eclipse event times and a dynamic Eclipse Countdown clock that includes an audio timer for each phase of the eclipse.

In conclusion, knowing when to remove your solar eclipse glasses doesn't have to be a source of panic or confusion. By following simple guidelines and utilizing smartphone apps designed specifically for eclipse viewing, you can enhance your experience and ensure that you don't miss any of the breathtaking phenomena associated with a total solar eclipse. So, whether you choose to go old-fashioned or embrace technology, make sure you have a safe and unforgettable eclipse-watching adventure.

Remember, always prioritize safety and protect your eyes during the eclipse. Wishing you clear skies and awe-inspiring moments!","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65e701ccb41a29b8a2fd120f/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3094,1451,x0,y304,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 19:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have both experienced significant growth in recent years, and there are several similarities between the two companies. Both AWS and Nvidia's core businesses emerged from unexpected opportunities. AWS realized it could sell its internal services, such as storage and compute, to external customers. Similarly, Nvidia discovered that its GPU, initially designed for gaming, was well-suited for AI workloads.

This realization has led to explosive revenue growth for both companies. Nvidia's revenue has tripled from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024 to $22.1 billion in Q4 2024. However, the majority of Nvidia's growth has come from its data center business. On the other hand, AWS has consistently been a major revenue driver for Amazon, although its growth has slowed down in recent years due to increased competition from Microsoft and Google.

Both AWS and Nvidia were in the right place at the right time. As web apps and mobile usage increased, the demand for cloud services grew. Similarly, the rise of AI and large language models coincided with the increased use of GPUs for processing these workloads.

While AWS has become a highly profitable business, Nvidia's growth has surpassed it in recent years. However, it remains to be seen if Nvidia can sustain this growth and become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS. If the GPU market becomes more competitive, Nvidia does have other businesses, but they are smaller revenue generators growing at a slower pace than the data center business.

In the short term, Nvidia's revenue growth is expected to continue. The company anticipates $24 billion in revenue for its current quarter, representing a 234% growth compared to the same quarter last year. However, as Nvidia's revenue ramps up, its growth rate is expected to decline.

Analysts project that Nvidia will generate $110.5 billion in revenue for its current fiscal year, an 81% increase from the previous year. While this growth rate is lower than what Nvidia achieved in the previous fiscal year, it is still impressive for a mature public company. Despite the expected slowdown, Nvidia is poised for significant growth in the coming quarters.

Looking ahead, AI is expected to be a major driver of growth for Nvidia in the coming years, even amidst increasing competition from other chipmakers like AMD and Intel. Nvidia currently has a strong hold on the market, but competition is likely to intensify. However, Nvidia's market dominance positions it well to withstand competition.

In conclusion, Nvidia's growth trajectory resembles that of AWS, with both companies benefiting from unexpected opportunities. While AWS has been a consistent revenue driver for Amazon, Nvidia's growth has surpassed it in recent years. The future looks promising for Nvidia, with AI expected to continue driving its growth. However, competition in the chip market is increasing, and Nvidia will need to stay innovative to maintain its market position.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2024/03/24/the-walking-dead-the-ones-who-live-episode-5-review---another-massively-disappointing-episode/,‘The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live’ Episode 5 Review - Another Massively Disappointing Episode,"""The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live"" has had its ups and downs throughout the season, and I can't help but express my concerns. While I absolutely loved episode 2, last week's episode and the season premiere fell short for me. Episode 3 was decent, but nothing extraordinary. With such a short season, each episode carries significant weight.

Now, on to the second-to-last episode of the season. It wasn't as tedious as last week's, but it was filled with ridiculous coincidences and familiar TWD shortcomings that left me unsatisfied. I had hoped for a return to form this week, but instead, we were presented with a lot of conveniently placed plot points that lacked creativity.

Spoiler alert!

Tonight's episode, titled ""Become,"" opens and closes with Gabriel, a surprising cameo that caught me off guard. Many anticipated a cameo from Morgan, who ventured out to find Rick after leaving Fear The Walking Dead. However, after Fear poorly handled his character, I'd rather not see Morgan again. He used to be one of my favorites, but his talent has been wasted season after season. Sadly, even on the main show, he wasn't utilized effectively, with his random moments of insanity and the nonsensical catchphrase ""You know what it is!"" It's truly a shame.

Nonetheless, I enjoyed the flashback scenes featuring Gabriel and Jadis. They built suspense, especially when it was revealed that Jadis had killed someone close to her. I genuinely thought Gabriel would meet his demise. It would have been a gutsy move for the series, but it seems that nowadays, it's risk-averse. Instead, Jadis is the one who meets her end, rambling about choosing sides and her transformation. Hence, the episode's title.

Unfortunately, this episode was plagued with implausibility. Rick and Michonne are on the run and have managed to stay under the radar. They're presumed dead, having escaped successfully. They decide to seek refuge in a cabin in the woods and stumble upon three individuals being attacked by peculiar zombies that have turned into stone walkers (or stoners, as I like to call them). Initially, these stone walkers seem invincible, with their rock-hard skin deflecting bullets. However, Rick and Michonne dispatch them with ease. It's almost comical how our heroes overpower their enemies without breaking a sweat. They even give back one of the attackers' revolvers and bullets after making them promise to change their ways. I found this decision perplexing. While not killing them is understandable, returning their weapons on a mere promise seems foolish.

Unsurprisingly, all three of these individuals meet their demise by the end of the episode. This raises a question I've asked countless times before: How do these seemingly unintelligent and incapable people manage to survive over a decade into the apocalypse? It's truly baffling. By this point, one would expect anyone they encounter to possess the same level of skill and resourcefulness as Rick and Michonne. After all, surviving this long requires intelligence, determination, and capability. Most individuals who have made it this far would be formidable fighters (unless they have been sheltered in some safe zone without the need for survival skills, which clearly wasn't the case for these three).

Ironically, I half-expected Rick and Michonne to start kissing in the middle of the fight, as they seem to seize every possible moment for romance now. It's quite amusing, to be honest. They had very few romantic moments in the main show, and now it's an endless display of affection.

But that's alright. At this point, it's only natural for them to have an insatiable desire for each other. They've been lucky too. Last week, they stumbled upon a fully powered smart home, where they decided to engage in intimate activities while the building was on the verge of collapsing! This week, they find solace in the Three Pines Cabin, a cozy retreat where they can relax, light candles, and enjoy some drinks.

Of course, their peace doesn't last long. The next morning, Jadis shows up, guns drawn, and this is where the episode takes a nosedive.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600b341eca045b614f49ec5/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=800,450,x0,y41,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 21:39:14,Innovation,Innovation

North America is currently experiencing a golden age of eclipses, and this week's celestial events are a prelude to a big event happening next week. In the early hours of Monday, March 25, the full worm moon will be partially eclipsed by Earth, creating a penumbral lunar eclipse. While it may not be as dramatic as a total lunar eclipse, this moment is significant because it sets the stage for a total solar eclipse on Monday, April 8, 2024. If you don't want to miss this incredible event, here are some planning tips to keep in mind.

Aside from the lunar eclipse, there are other exciting things happening in the night sky this week. As the waning gibbous moon rises later and later at night, it will pass close to a couple of bright stars, providing a perfect opportunity for stargazing in the early evening.

Let's dive into the details of what you can expect this week:

Monday, March 25: 'Worm Moon Lunar Eclipse'

The third full moon of 2024, known as the ""Worm Moon,"" will move through Earth's outer shadow in space, resulting in a slight penumbral lunar eclipse. This eclipse will be visible from various parts of the world, including North and South America, Europe, East Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. In New York, the moon will begin to be eclipsed from 00:53 a.m. EDT until 05:32 a.m. EDT on Monday, March 25, with the maximum eclipse occurring at 03:12 a.m. EDT. In Los Angeles, the eclipse will occur from 9:53 p.m. PDT until 02:32 a.m. PDT on Sunday, March 24/Monday, March 25, with the maximum eclipse at 00:12 a.m. EDT.

Tuesday, March 26: Moon And Spica

A few hours after sunset, step outside and witness the almost full moon rising due east. However, this moonrise will be unique because just to the top right of the rising moon, you will see the bright star Spica. Spica is the brightest star in the constellation Virgo and one of the 20 brightest stars in the night sky. It will be within 1.4 degrees of our natural satellite, creating a stunning celestial sight.

Saturday, March 30: Moon And Antares

If you find yourself awake late on Friday or in the early hours of Saturday, take a look towards the southeast. You will spot a 78%-lit waning gibbous moon less than a degree from Antares, a red supergiant star in the constellation Scorpius. This pairing of the moon and Antares will be a beautiful sight to behold.

Galaxies Of The Week: Bode's And The Cigar

This week, Ursa Minor and Ursa Major, visible in the northern sky after dark, will showcase two breathtaking galaxies through an 8-inch telescope. M81, also known as Bode's galaxy, is a large spiral galaxy located approximately 12 million light-years from Earth. It is one of the brightest galaxies in the night sky. On the other hand, M82, known as the Cigar galaxy, is a starburst galaxy situated about 12 million light-years away from Earth. It is renowned for its high rate of star formation. You can spot M82's stars as small, diffuse patches of light northwest of the bright star Dubhe in the Big Dipper.

Eclipse Tip Of The Week: Preparing For The Total Solar Eclipse

Less than two weeks remain until a rare and awe-inspiring celestial event takes place in North America—a total solar eclipse. To ensure you don't miss out, it's crucial to make solid plans now. Remember, you must be within the path of totality (the yellow stripe on the map) to fully experience the eclipse. Simply getting close to it won't make a significant difference. You can find a plethora of articles on my feed providing information on where to stay and where to witness the eclipse. Alternatively, you can visit websites that offer maps, simulations, and event listings to assist you in planning your eclipse-viewing experience.

Remember to check online planetariums like Stellarium and The Sky Live for the most accurate location-specific information regarding the times and dates of celestial events. Take note of planet-rise/planet-set, sunrise/sunset, and moonrise/moonset times for your specific location.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/krisholt/2024/03/24/nyt-connections-hints-and-answers-for-monday-march-25/,"NYT ‘Connections’ Hints And Answers For Monday, March 25","Welcome to today's game of Connections! If you're ready to challenge your word skills and make some exciting links, you're in the right place. But before we dive into the game, let's go over the rules and how to play.

In Connections, you'll be presented with a grid of 16 words. Your mission is to group them into four sets of four words by finding the connections between them. The groups can vary, ranging from horror movie franchises to types of verbs or even rappers.

Remember, each puzzle has only one solution, so you'll need to think carefully about words that could fit into multiple categories. Don't worry if you get stuck – you can shuffle the words to help you see the connections more clearly.

To make things easier, each group is color-coded. The yellow group is usually the simplest, followed by the blue and green groups. The purple group, on the other hand, tends to be the trickiest, often involving wordplay. Keep that in mind as you solve the puzzle.

Once you've selected four words that you believe belong together, hit Submit. But be careful! If your guess is incorrect, you'll lose a life. If you're close to the correct group, you might receive a message telling you that you're just one word away from getting it right. But you'll still need to figure out which word to swap.

Remember, four mistakes mean game over. So, let's make sure that doesn't happen by using some hints or, if necessary, checking out today's Connections answers.

Now, let's move on to today's hints. Take your time scrolling through them. After the hints, I'll reveal the groups without immediately disclosing which words belong to each.

Here are the 16 words for today's puzzle:
- PACE
- CLIPPER
- MOVE
- MEDICINE
- FASTER
- PROMPTER
- ROCKET
- SPEED
- GO
- SPUR
- COMMUTE
- HURRY
- RATE
- VISION
- CLIP
- PACER

Now, let's take a look at the hints for today's groups:
- Yellow group: Something's swiftness.
- Green group: Speed up!
- Blue group: NBA team player.
- Purple group: Linked by a term meaning ""over a long distance.""

Feeling stuck? Don't worry. I'm here to help. But before I reveal the answers, let's make sure you're ready for them.

Today's groups are as follows:
- Yellow group: How fast something is going.
- Green group: ""Step on it!""
- Blue group: NBA team player.
- Purple group: Tele____.

Are you ready for the answers? If not, don't scroll down just yet. I don't want to spoil the fun. Take your time.

Okay, here we go!

Today's Connections answers are:
- Yellow group: How fast something is going (CLIP, PACE, RATE, SPEED).
- Green group: ""Step on it!"" (FASTER, GO, HURRY, MOVE).
- Blue group: NBA team player (CLIPPER, PACER, ROCKET, SPUR).
- Purple group: Tele____ (COMMUTE, MEDICINE, PROMPTER, VISION).

No perfect game today, but my winning streak remains at five games in a row. 

I immediately recognized the blue group, although I suspected it might be a red herring. The green and yellow groups were interesting as they seemed to represent the noun and verb versions of the same concept.

I managed to solve the yellow group first and then made a silly mistake by including COMMUTE in the green group instead of FASTER. After correcting that error, I tackled the purple group and achieved victory.

That concludes today's Connections clues and answers. If you need hints or the solution for Tuesday's game, be sure to check out my blog.

Before we wrap up, here's a quick life tip: Treat yourself to a meal at the best restaurant in your area at least once. If you need to save up for it, set aside a little money each month. Trust me, the experience will be worth it. While takeout is a nice treat, dining at the top-rated establishment nearby is likely to create lasting memories.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/64dbcee7d64da3663d88000e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-24 17:30:02,Innovation,Innovation

Welcome back, Wordle enthusiasts! It's the start of a new week and the last week of March. Time flies when you're having fun with puzzle games! Despite the odd weather this weekend, with half a foot of snow surprising us during the spring season, it's time to get back to work and back to Wordling. Let's dive in!

Hints and Clues:
If you're looking for hints and clues for Sunday's Wordle, you've come to the right place. Today's Wordle has a double letter, and it's often thought of as a proper noun. Keep these in mind as you try to crack the code!

Spoiler Alert: Answer Revealed!
Now, for those who want the answer, here it is:

[Insert Answer Here]

Wordle Analysis:
After playing Wordle, I always check my progress using Wordle Bot. It's a great way to see how well I did and compare it with others. If you want to check your Wordles, give Wordle Bot a try!

I have to admit, this one had me stumped for a while. Initially, I had 195 possible solutions, which was quite overwhelming. Even after narrowing it down to 40 with the word ""Boink,"" I was still struggling.

However, my breakthrough came when I guessed ""Allay."" It informed me that there was more than one 'L' in the phrase, which left me with just one word to figure out. I almost went with ""palsy"" before realizing I needed a second 'L.' After some brainstorming, I finally settled on ""sally,"" which I usually associate with a name. But it turns out, it's also an antiquated term for a battle tactic.

Competitive Wordle Score:
Once again, I didn't score any points for guessing in four attempts or tying with the Bot. It's a big zero for me this time. But hey, there's always next time!

The Etymology of ""Sally"":
In the context of Wordle, the word ""sally"" means to suddenly rush forth or make a sudden attack from a defensive position. It can also mean to embark on a journey or venture. The etymology of ""sally"" in this context is quite fascinating, tracing back through multiple languages before arriving in English.

The term originated from the Middle French word ""sallie,"" which is the noun form of ""sallir,"" meaning ""to rush out, leap forth."" This Middle French word has its roots in the Latin word ""salire,"" which means ""to leap."" Interestingly, this Latin root has given rise to related English words like ""salient,"" meaning ""prominently projecting,"" and ""assail,"" meaning ""to attack."" These words reflect the idea of movement or leaping forth.

Therefore, the etymology of ""sally"" reflects the action of moving out or leaping forth, often with a sense of suddenness or unexpectedness. It can be seen in a physical attack from a fortified position or in setting out on a journey or new venture.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewwight/2024/03/24/helping-patients-access-sickle-cell-disease-treatments-in-west-africa/,Helping Patients Access Sickle Cell Disease Treatments In West Africa,"A researcher from Cameroon is dedicated to helping patients in low-income countries in West Africa access affordable medicine for sickle cell disease. With over 4 million people worldwide affected by the disease, the majority of cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa, where 89% of women in central and West Africa lack access to universal medical coverage.

Dr. Marthe-Sandrine Eiymo Mwa Mpollo, a scientist and co-founder of NaYa Health, understands that having a drug for sickle cell disease is not enough for patients; affordability is crucial. Inspired by this, she created NaYa Health, a digital patient assistance platform that aims to help underserved patients without insurance access medication through community savings, deferred payments, and a portable health-only savings account. 

Through a pilot implementation in Cameroon's capital, NaYa Health has empowered informal workers to handle unexpected challenges while increasing income for local medical providers and guaranteeing access to critical services.

NaYa Health's efforts have been recognized internationally, as the organization was selected for the financial inclusion challenge by MIT Solve. Dr. Mpollo emphasizes that NaYa Health is fulfilling the promise of research findings by enabling patients with sickle cell disease in Cameroon to access necessary medications without delay, even when facing financial constraints.

Dr. Mpollo's passion for medicine in Cameroon stems from her upbringing in the country, where she witnessed the impact of sickle cell disease on families' quality of life. This, coupled with her exposure to ""doctors without borders"" shows, sparked her desire to bring healthcare to challenged communities. Although her initial aspiration was to become a medical doctor, her journey led her to life science research in Canada and the United States, where she obtained a doctorate focused on developing therapies for sickle cell disease.

After publishing scientific papers on the mechanism causing lung damage in sickle cell patients and communicating her research findings, Dr. Mpollo realized that access to medication is crucial for research to reach its full life-saving potential. This realization led to the launch of NaYa Health. She believes that scientists from the Global South have a unique perspective on healthcare limitations, particularly in terms of affordability, access, and cultural acceptance of research findings. By tailoring their research to the needs of their communities, scientists from the Global South can better address healthcare issues and work with local actors to distribute scientific findings effectively.

In another part of Africa, a team in Zambia is utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) to improve care for pregnant women. Despite a significant decrease in the death rate for pregnant mothers in Zambia, there is still a 1% risk of mortality. Tafadzwa Kalisto Munzwa, founder and CEO of Dawa Health, based in Lusaka, Zambia, leads the DawaMom project. This initiative combines AI tools, last-mile health workers, mobile clinics, and digital platforms to enhance maternal and child health. Over 60 community health workers are involved in providing in-community healthcare through DawaMom, and more than 800 mothers have enrolled in the mobile platform.

The DawaMom project utilizes generative AI models that directly interact with patients, responding to their needs and providing valuable support and guidance throughout their pregnancy journey. This innovative approach aims to reduce maternal and child mortality rates in Zambia and improve overall healthcare outcomes for pregnant women.

These initiatives in Cameroon and Zambia highlight the importance of leveraging technology and innovative solutions to address healthcare challenges in low-income countries. By focusing on affordability, accessibility, and community engagement, these projects are making a significant impact on the lives of patients and healthcare providers. Through their dedication and determination, researchers and entrepreneurs like Dr. Mpollo and Mr. Munzwa are bringing hope and positive change to communities in need.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66009a73668df974c31e0a4f/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=579,579,x127,y431,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 17:54:08,Innovation,Innovation
