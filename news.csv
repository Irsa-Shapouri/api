If you're a fan of Wordle, you're going to love this game. Strands is a beta version of a word search puzzle featured in The New York Times. The objective is to find a group of words that have something in common and uncover a special word called a spangram. Let's dive in and unravel the mystery together!

Before we get started, let's clarify the rules of the game. Each day, a new Strands puzzle is presented to players. The puzzle consists of a grid of letters, typically six by eight in size. Your task is to find words that share a common theme, which is hinted at in the puzzle. When you find a word related to the theme, it will be highlighted in blue. Additionally, you need to find the spangram, which is a word that connects opposite sides of the grid. The spangram will be highlighted in yellow.

Now, let's move on to today's puzzle. The official theme hint for today is ""Sign language."" To give you an extra clue, the theme is related to ""Constellation."" I hope these hints will guide you towards the solution!

And now, the moment you've been waiting for: the answers to today's Strands puzzle. The spangram for today is ""ASTROLOGY."" Take a look at the grid provided to locate the spangram. Once you've found it, the rest of the puzzle becomes easier to solve. Here are the other words you need to find:

- Bull
- Goat
- Scorpion
- Virgin
- Archer
- Scales
- Twins

I must admit, today's puzzle was quite challenging for me. I got stuck on a few words and had to use hints to progress. At first, I thought the theme was animals since I found ""Bull"" and ""Goat."" However, that didn't make sense in relation to sign language. It was only when I came across the word ""OLOGY"" that things started to click. I realized I needed a word that could fit before ""OLOGY,"" and that's when I found ""Astrology."" Suddenly, everything fell into place. All the words I had found were actually constellations! I then discovered ""Archer,"" ""Twins,"" and finally, ""Scorpion."" It was a tough journey, but I made it in the end.

On a side note, I recently watched the movie Taxi Driver after many years, and it was oddly coincidental that there was a scene where astrology signs were discussed. Life works in mysterious ways!

I hope you enjoyed today's Strands puzzle as much as I did. How did you fare? Let me know on Twitter and Facebook.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2024/03/24/playstation-plus-free-games-for-april-2024-predictions-rumors-leaks-release-date-and-more/,"PlayStation Plus Free Games For April 2024: Predictions, Rumors, Leaks, Release Date And More","It's almost April, but with all the recent snow, it still feels more like the middle of winter than the start of spring. We're also approaching the announcement of next month's PlayStation Plus lineup. If you haven't already, there's still time to grab this month's lineup, which offers a great selection of four very different games. Personally, I'm thrilled that one of my long-time predictions, the kung fu action game Sifu, finally came true. Now, let's see if any of my other predictions for April turn out to be accurate.

PlayStation Plus, or PS Plus, is Sony's monthly membership program that provides access to online gaming. It's important to note that PS Plus is not required for streaming movies or TV shows on platforms like Netflix or for playing free-to-play games such as Warzone or Fortnite. However, any paid online games do require a subscription.

There are three tiers of PS Plus: Essential, Extra, and Premium. For the purpose of this blog post, we'll focus on the free monthly games available with the Essential tier. Following a recent price increase, the costs for these tiers are as follows: PS Plus Essential — $79.99/year; PS Plus Extra — $134.99/year; PS Plus Premium — $159.99/year.

So, when can we expect Sony to reveal next month's PS Plus games? Typically, the new lineup is announced on the last Wednesday of the month, although there are exceptions. The general rule is that the games are released on the first Tuesday of the month, with the announcement taking place the previous Wednesday. Therefore, we should anticipate an announcement for April's lineup on the morning of Wednesday, March 27th, and the new games will become available on Tuesday, April 2nd.

At this point, there haven't been any leaks or rumors regarding April's PS Plus Essential games. I've searched extensively and haven't found any clues either. Since there are no games scheduled for release on April 2nd, it's highly unlikely that a new release will be included in the lineup. If any leaks do occur between now and Wednesday morning, I'll make sure to update this post. In the meantime, I've compiled my list of predictions, which has become slightly shorter now that Sifu has been confirmed. However, I must admit that some of these predictions are more wishful thinking than grounded in reality. It's also possible that we'll see a Simulator or sports game included.

Here are some of my predictions and wishful thinking titles for April's PlayStation Plus lineup:

1. Assassin's Creed Valhalla
2. Need For Speed Unbound
3. The Outer Worlds
4. Forspoken
5. Demon's Souls
6. The Order 1886
7. The Last Of Us Part 1
8. LEGO Jurassic World
9. Marvel's Midnight Suns
10. Tales of Arise
11. Cult Of The Lamb
12. Little Nightmares 2
13. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor
14. Nier: Automata
15. Elden Ring
16. Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice
17. Metal: Hellsinger
18. Donut Country
19. Dead Island 2
20. Metro Exodus
21. Gollum
22. Skull Island: Rise Of Kong
23. The Walking Dead: Destinies

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have several similarities in their growth trajectories. Both companies stumbled upon their core businesses through unexpected circumstances. AWS discovered that it could sell the internal services it developed for itself, while Nvidia realized that its gaming GPU was well-suited for AI workloads.

In recent years, both companies have experienced explosive revenue growth. Nvidia's revenue has grown at triple digits, from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024 to $22.1 billion in Q4 2024. However, the majority of this growth came from Nvidia's data center business. On the other hand, AWS has consistently been a revenue driver for Amazon, but its growth has started to slow down.

Both companies benefited from being in the right place at the right time. As web apps and mobile emerged, the cloud provided on-demand resources, and enterprises saw the value of moving workloads to the cloud. Similarly, the rise of AI and large language models coincided with the increased use of GPUs for processing these workloads.

While AWS has become a highly profitable business, its growth has begun to slow down. The question is whether Nvidia can sustain its growth and become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS. Although Nvidia has other businesses, they are smaller revenue generators that are growing more slowly than the GPU data center business.

In the short term, Nvidia's revenue growth is expected to continue. It anticipates $24 billion in revenue for the current quarter, a growth rate of around 234% compared to the year-ago quarter. However, as the company's revenue ramps up, its growth rate is expected to decline. Analysts predict that Nvidia will generate $110.5 billion in revenue for the current fiscal year, an 81% increase from the previous year.

Despite the expected slowdown in growth, Nvidia is still projected to scale its revenue past the $100 billion annual run rate mark. The company has significant growth potential in the AI market, even as competition from AMD, Intel, and other chipmakers emerges. Currently, Nvidia holds a dominant position in the chip market, but AMD is gaining ground at the board level.

In conclusion, both Nvidia and AWS have experienced remarkable growth, but Nvidia's future growth potential remains promising. With its strong position in the AI market and dominance in the chip industry, Nvidia is well-positioned to continue its revenue growth, even as competition increases.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation

Welcome back, Wordle enthusiasts! It's the start of a new work week, and that means it's time to dive into another exciting round of Wordle. But before we get started, let's take a moment to reflect on the weekend.

The weather has been quite unpredictable lately. Just when we thought spring was here to stay, a surprise snowfall covered the ground. It may be cold and wintry, but there's something undeniably beautiful about the snowy landscape. So, despite our longing for warmer days, let's embrace the enchanting scenery and focus on cracking today's Wordle puzzle.

Now, let's get down to business and unravel the mystery of today's Wordle. Here are the hints and clues to point you in the right direction:

Hint: Typically, we associate this with a specific name or title.
Clue: Today's Wordle features a double letter.

Now, brace yourself for the answer, but only if you're ready for the big reveal. Spoiler alert!

Wordle Analysis

After taking a shot at today's Wordle, I couldn't help but analyze my progress. It started off quite challenging, with numerous possibilities still on the table. Trade narrowed it down slightly, but I was still far from finding the solution.

Luckily, the word ""allay"" turned out to be a pivotal guess. It confirmed the presence of multiple 'L's and left me with just one word to crack. Initially, I was tempted to go with ""palsy,"" but then I realized I needed that second 'L.' After some brainstorming, I finally settled on ""sally."" Although it's often associated with a person's name, it also refers to an old battle tactic.

Competitive Wordle Score

Unfortunately, this round didn't earn me any points. I failed to guess the correct phrase within four attempts or tie with the Wordle Bot. It's a tough pill to swallow, but sometimes the challenge lies in enjoying the game rather than focusing on the score.

Today's Wordle Etymology

The word ""sally"" holds a fascinating etymology when used outside of its proper noun context. It signifies a sudden rush or attack from a defensive position, or even embarking on a new journey or adventure. Tracing its origins, we find ourselves delving into several languages before arriving at its English form.

The Middle French term ""sallie,"" derived from the verb ""sallir"" meaning ""to rush out, leap forth,"" serves as the foundation for this word. ""Sallir"" itself can be traced back to the Latin word ""salire,"" which translates to ""to leap."" This Latin root has given birth to various related English words, such as ""salient"" (prominently projecting) and ""assail"" (to attack), all reflecting the concept of movement and leaping forth.

As we explore the etymology of ""sally,"" we discover its connection to the action of moving out or leaping forth, often accompanied by a sense of suddenness or unexpectedness. Whether it's launching an assault from a fortified position or embarking on a new journey, ""sally"" encapsulates the essence of bold and daring action.
