https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have similarities in their growth trajectories. Both companies started with core businesses that emerged from unexpected opportunities. AWS discovered it could sell the internal services it had created for itself, while Nvidia realized that its gaming GPU was well-suited for processing AI workloads. This led to explosive revenue growth for both companies, with Nvidia's revenue growing from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024 to $22.1 billion in Q4 2024.

While AWS has been consistently profitable for Amazon, its growth has slowed down compared to Nvidia. This can be attributed to the law of large numbers and the increasing competition in the cloud market. However, Nvidia's growth is expected to continue, with the company anticipating $24 billion worth of revenue in its current quarter. Wall Street analysts also expect Nvidia to generate $110.5 billion worth of revenue in its current fiscal year, representing an 81% increase from the previous year.

Despite the competition from other chipmakers like AMD and Intel, Nvidia remains in control of the market. It has a strong presence in the chip market, and even though AMD is gaining ground at the board level, Nvidia still dominates. This gives Nvidia the advantage to sustain its growth in the coming years.

The key to Nvidia's continued success lies in its focus on AI. AI has become increasingly important, and Nvidia's GPUs are well-positioned to handle the processing requirements of AI workloads. As AI continues to evolve and grow, Nvidia is expected to benefit from the demand for its products.

In conclusion, Nvidia has the potential to become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS. Its strong growth trajectory and dominance in the chip market make it well-positioned for continued success. While competition may increase in the future, Nvidia's focus on AI and its ability to adapt to changing market dynamics will be crucial in maintaining its growth.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/03/24/samsung-s24-ultra-s23-free-update-warning-for-galaxy-android-users/,Samsung Issues Critical Update For Millions Of Galaxy Users,"If you own a Samsung Galaxy device, there's an important update you need to be aware of. It's crucial that you check for this update and install it as soon as it becomes available. Additionally, get ready for a significant change that will be coming to your device soon. Trust me, you don't want to miss out on this!

Samsung has been rolling out their March security update, and now it's reaching budget models in addition to the premium devices that were eligible first. For example, carrier-unlocked S21 FE devices in the US recently received the update. Over the past two weeks, various versions of S24s, S23s, and S22s have been updated, with older and budget variants included later on. It's essential that you ensure your device downloads and installs this new software as soon as it becomes available for your specific network and model.

To check whether your device will receive the monthly update, you can visit the following link: [insert link here].

The March update includes numerous fixes for Android and Samsung devices, and it also addresses a couple of high-risk vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could potentially allow malware to take control of some or all of your device. Therefore, it's crucial to install this update to protect your device from potential security threats.

Now, the availability of the March update isn't the most significant news of the week. Samsung has finally joined Google's seamless update roadshow after years of avoiding it. Instead of the traditional download, install, and reboot cycle for updates, Samsung has adopted a new system. This system downloads and installs updates in the background to a secondary partition on the device. The device then reboots from that partition when it restarts, making it the primary partition. Meanwhile, the other partition waits for the next update. This process reduces the time during which the device cannot be used normally, with most of it happening in the background.

Google explains that this new system, known as A/B system updates or seamless updates, ensures that a booting system remains intact on the disk during an over-the-air (OTA) update. As a result, the chances of having an inactive device after an update are reduced. This means fewer device replacements and device reflashes at repair and warranty centers.

When a seamless update is being installed, you'll be able to tell by the presence of two progress bars—one for the download/install process and another for verification. The Galaxy A55 has been the first device to receive this update, but it's expected that it will be rolled out to more devices in the coming months. We're eagerly waiting to see which devices will be next in line for this update.

It's still uncertain whether this new update system will extend to all Samsung models. Samsung updates have been known for their complexity and the need to consult checklists to determine what updates are available, when they'll be released, and how long they'll take to install.

So, why has Samsung finally decided to adopt this update system? It's possible that they were pushed to make this decision rather than choosing it themselves. A recent comment on the Android Open Source Project suggested that the legacy alternative to seamless updates would be removed after running parallel to seamless updates for eight years. Considering that seamless updates have been available since 2016, Samsung's delay in adopting them has become quite legendary. On one hand, this has been a source of frustration for the Android project. On the other hand, it's important to note that there is no Android without Samsung. Therefore, behind-the-scenes discussions were likely held to determine the best approach to updates moving forward.

While this new update system may shorten the update process to just a minute or two during which the device is unusable, it won't necessarily simplify the combination of Samsung and Android updates that occur each month across various devices. However, it will eliminate the need for user action. Since A/B updates occur in the background, they are no longer initiated by the user. To prevent any disruption to users, it is recommended that updates are scheduled when the device is in idle maintenance mode, such as overnight and on Wi-Fi.

Of course, this new system is still far from Apple's one-stop-shop approach. However, as iPhones and Android devices continue to become more similar, we may see them get a little closer in the future. Ultimately, this new update system is a step in the right direction for Samsung users, making the update process more seamless and efficient.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65b9d23fb7b46f6467a28780/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2366,1280,x313,y135,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 22:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2024/03/24/the-walking-dead-the-ones-who-live-episode-5-review---another-massively-disappointing-episode/,‘The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live’ Episode 5 Review - Another Massively Disappointing Episode,"""The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live"" has had its ups and downs throughout the season, and the second-to-last episode is no exception. While it wasn't as tedious as the previous episode, it was still quite preposterous. There were too many ridiculous coincidences and bad storytelling habits that left me disappointed. I was hoping for a return to form, but instead, we got a lot of convenient plot points that felt lazy and uninspired.

Spoiler Alert!

The episode, titled ""Become,"" starts and ends with a surprising cameo from Gabriel. Many people were expecting a cameo from Morgan, who had set out to find Rick after leaving Fear The Walking Dead. However, after Fear ruined his character over the years, I'm glad we didn't see him again. It's a shame to see such a talented actor wasted season after season. Gabriel's flashback scenes with Jadis were intriguing, especially when we learned that she had killed someone close to her. I thought Gabriel might meet his end, which would have been a gutsy move for the series. But instead, Jadis bites the bullet, or rather, gets bitten. Her final moments are filled with cheesy dialogue about choosing sides and who she has become, which ties into the episode's title.

What didn't work for me in this episode was how implausible everything felt. Rick and Michonne are on the run and have managed to disappear. They're presumed dead and decide to hide in a cabin in the woods. Along the way, they encounter a group of survivors being attacked by ""stoners"" - zombies that have turned into stone walkers. Initially, they seem difficult to kill because their skin is rock-hard, but our heroes quickly dispatch them without trouble. Michonne even offers them some ramen as a peace offering, but the survivors turn on them and demand their belongings. Rick and Michonne effortlessly overpower them and even return one of their revolvers. I found this decision baffling. Sure, don't kill them, but why give them their weapons back based on a promise to be good?

Of course, these three survivors end up dead by the end of the episode, raising the question of how people this stupid and incapable of basic survival skills have managed to survive over a decade into the apocalypse. It's truly baffling. At this point, I would expect anyone they come across to be as skilled as Rick and Michonne. They've made it this far, so they must be intelligent, determined, and capable. It's hard to believe that anyone who has survived this long wouldn't be a dangerous fighter.

On a lighter note, Rick and Michonne's relationship seems to be going strong. They can't seem to keep their hands off each other, kissing at every possible opportunity. It's amusing to see how much romantic content they have now compared to the main show. Last week, they found a fully-powered smart home and decided to have sex while the building was collapsing! This week, they stumble upon the Three Pines Cabin, where they enjoy a cozy retreat with candles and booze.

But, as expected, their peaceful moments are short-lived. Jadis shows up the next morning, guns drawn, and the episode ends on a cliffhanger.

Overall, ""Become"" had its flaws, with implausible plot points and questionable character decisions. However, the episode did have its moments, particularly the flashback scenes with Gabriel and Jadis. As we approach the season finale, I hope to see the show regain its footing and deliver a satisfying conclusion to the season.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600b341eca045b614f49ec5/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=800,450,x0,y41,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 21:39:14,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/03/24/see-the-moon-eclipsed-by-earth-as-americas-total-solar-eclipse-draws-near-the-night-sky-this-week/,See The Moon Begin Its ‘Eclipse Season:’ The Night Sky This Week,"North America is currently experiencing a golden age of eclipses, with an exciting event coming up next week. However, before that, there will be a slight penumbral lunar eclipse on Monday, March 25, 2024. This eclipse, known as the ""Worm Moon Lunar Eclipse,"" will see the full moon pass through Earth's outer shadow in space. Although it won't be a total lunar eclipse, it is a critical moment because it will set the stage for a total solar eclipse on Monday, April 8, 2024.

If you're interested in witnessing the total solar eclipse, here are some planning tips to ensure you don't miss out. First and foremost, it's essential to be in the path of totality, indicated by the yellow stripe on the map. Simply being close to the path won't make a significant difference. So make sure you plan your location accordingly. For more information on where to stay and where to view the eclipse, you can find numerous articles on my feed or visit websites that offer maps, simulations, and event listings.

Now, let's explore some other celestial highlights for the week. On Tuesday, March 26, after sunset, you'll have the opportunity to witness the moonrise. What makes this moonrise unique is the presence of the bright star Spica, located just to the top right of the rising moon. Spica is the brightest star in the constellation Virgo and one of the 20 brightest stars in the night sky. It will be within 1.4 degrees of our natural satellite, creating a visually captivating scene.

If you're awake late on Friday, March 30, into the early hours of Saturday, take a moment to look to the southeast. There, you'll see a 78%-lit waning gibbous moon positioned less than a degree from Antares, a red supergiant star in the constellation Scorpius.

For those interested in observing galaxies, Ursa Minor and Ursa Major will be visible in the northern sky after dark this week. These constellations are home to two stunning galaxies that can be observed using an 8-inch telescope. M81, also known as Bode's galaxy, is a large spiral galaxy located approximately 12 million light-years from Earth. It shines brightly in the night sky. On the other hand, M82, referred to as the Cigar galaxy, is a starburst galaxy with a high rate of star formation. In a telescope's field of view, you can spot its stars as small, diffuse patches of light northwest of the bright star Dubhe in the Big Dipper.

To ensure you have accurate and location-specific information regarding the celestial events mentioned, it's recommended to consult online planetariums such as Stellarium and The Sky Live. These platforms provide valuable data on planet-rise/planet-set, sunrise/sunset, and moonrise/moonset times specific to your location.

In conclusion, this week offers several exciting opportunities to indulge in stargazing and astronomy. From the ""Worm Moon Lunar Eclipse"" to the stunning conjunction of the moon and Spica, and the close proximity of the moon to Antares, there's plenty to capture your attention. Additionally, don't forget to explore the magnificent galaxies in Ursa Minor and Ursa Major. Remember to plan ahead to ensure you don't miss the upcoming total solar eclipse. Wishing you clear skies and unforgettable celestial experiences.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/5fb7fc7c1bbcea1ee676a031/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2390,1121,x1617,y1192,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-24 20:15:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/techcrunch-mobility-the-wheels-are-starting-to-come-off-the-fisker-ev-bus/,TechCrunch Mobility: The wheels are starting to come off the Fisker EV bus,"Welcome to TechCrunch Mobility, your go-to source for news and insights on the future of transportation. In this week's edition, we'll be discussing some recent developments in the automotive industry, as well as exciting new investments and startups in the mobility space.

Let's start by addressing the proposed standards released by the Biden Administration via the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency. These regulations will have a significant impact on U.S. automakers and consumers alike. While the regulations have been softened to accommodate the automotive industry, they still impose stricter standards than before.

The DOE has introduced a ""petroleum equivalency factor"" that assigns a score to electric vehicles (EVs) under the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. This change aims to make it easier for automakers to meet the standards and avoid hefty fines. On the other hand, the EPA has released tailpipe standards for 2027 to 2032 model year vehicles, which put more pressure on automakers but allow for flexibility in meeting the rules through different powertrain options.

What does this mean for EV startups? Well, companies like Rivian, Tesla, and Lucid, which already meet the clean car standards, won't be significantly affected. However, legacy automakers investing in EVs while still profiting from internal combustion engine vehicles may face challenges. In this regard, plug-in hybrids might emerge as winners.

Now, let's dive into some exciting news from the mobility world. One notable development is Uber's first investment in an Africa-founded startup. The company has invested in Moove, an African mobility fintech that provides vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers. This $100 million investment highlights Uber's commitment to a fully zero-emission fleet by 2040, as Moove focuses on electric vehicles as part of its business strategy.

Another interesting startup to keep an eye on is Clevon, which has been developing autonomous delivery technology since 2018. Although there were rumors of the company struggling to secure new investment, it has now entered into an exclusivity agreement for a merger with an American electric vehicle company. This development showcases the resilience and potential of the autonomous delivery sector.

In addition to these investments, there are several other noteworthy deals in the mobility space. Amber, a startup that offers aftermarket Tesla extended warranties, recently raised $3.18 million in a seed round. The company aims to provide Tesla owners with affordable and comprehensive warranty coverage.

Candela, an electric boat maker, secured $25 million in funding led by Groupe Beneteau. With a focus on sustainable and efficient electric boats, Candela is poised to disrupt the traditional boating industry.

Pelikan Mobility, a French startup developing innovative mobility solutions, also made waves with its recent funding round. The company raised an undisclosed amount to further its mission of revolutionizing urban transportation.

These investments and developments demonstrate the growing interest and potential in the mobility sector. As the world moves towards a more sustainable and efficient transportation future, startups and established companies alike are seizing opportunities to shape the industry.

That's all for this week's edition of TechCrunch Mobility. Stay tuned for more exciting news and insights on the future of transportation.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1363022906.jpg?resize=1200,730",2024-03-24 19:00:33,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2024/03/24/todays-wordle-1010-hints-clues-and-answer-for-monday-march-25th/,"Today’s ‘Wordle’ 1010 Hints, Clues And Answer For Monday, March 25th","It's Monday, and we're back to the work week after an eventful weekend. Despite the arrival of spring, we were surprised with a sudden snowstorm. It may be cold, but the snow-covered landscape is undeniably beautiful. Now, let's get back to Wordling and solve today's puzzle!

To crack today's Wordle, here are your hints:
- Think of today's phrase as a proper noun.
- Pay attention to the fact that there is a double letter in the solution.

Now, let's move on to the analysis of today's Wordle. If you want to see how you did, you can check your Wordles with Wordle Bot.

I must admit, today's puzzle left me quite confused. I started off with a whopping 195 possible solutions after my initial guesses. Even after narrowing it down to 40 with the word ""Boink,"" I was still struggling to find the right answer.

However, my luck changed when I guessed ""Allay."" It revealed that there was more than one 'L,' leaving me with just one word remaining. I almost went with ""palsy"" before realizing I needed a second 'L.' Finally, after some brainstorming, I settled on ""sally,"" which I usually think of as a name. Interestingly, ""sally"" is also a term for a battle tactic.

Now, let's talk about the competitive Wordle score. Unfortunately, I didn't earn any points this time. Guessing in four or tying with the Bot doesn't count as a win. So, it's a big, fat zero for me.

Before we wrap up, let's explore the etymology of the word ""sally"" in today's non-proper noun context. Primarily, it means to suddenly rush forth or launch a sudden attack from a defensive position. It can also refer to embarking on a journey or a new venture. The word has an interesting etymological journey, passing through several languages before finding its way into English.

The Middle French word ""sallie,"" derived from the verb ""sallir"" meaning ""to rush out, leap forth,"" serves as the origin of ""sally"" in this context. ""Sallir"" itself comes from the Latin word ""salire,"" which means ""to leap."" This Latin root has given rise to related words in English, such as ""salient"" (prominently projecting) and ""assail"" (to attack), all reflecting the notion of movement or leaping forth.

So, when we use the word ""sally,"" we are referring to the action of moving out or leaping forth, often with a sense of suddenness or unexpectedness. This applies to both physical attacks from a fortified position and embarking on new journeys or ventures.
