https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/boeing-ceo-to-leave-company-by-year-end-after-a-wave-of-safety-incidents/,Boeing CEO to leave company by year-end after a wave of safety incidents,"Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun is set to step down from his position by the end of this year, according to the company. This decision comes in the wake of a series of safety incidents that have plagued the aircraft manufacturer.

One notable incident involved a cabin panel blowout on a Boeing plane, which raised concerns about the safety of their aircraft. Additionally, there have been several other serious safety incidents that have further tarnished the company's reputation.

Boeing is known for its innovation acceleration program, Aerospace Xelerated, which was previously called the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI). This program focuses on collaborating with startups in the aerospace industry. It remains unclear how Calhoun's departure will impact this program, and TechCrunch has reached out to Aerospace Xelerated for further information.

In a statement, Calhoun expressed his intention to continue working on stabilizing and positioning the company for the future in the coming months. This indicates that he is committed to resolving the issues that have plagued Boeing and ensuring a smooth transition for his successor.

One incident that significantly impacted Boeing's safety reputation occurred in January when an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 jet was forced to make an emergency landing. This incident led to the grounding of 171 Max 9 jets for several weeks. It was the largest safety crisis for Boeing since the crashes of two Max 8 jets in 2018 and 2019, resulting in the tragic deaths of 346 individuals.

In addition to Calhoun's departure, Stan Deal, who currently leads Boeing's commercial airplanes business (BCA), will also be leaving the company. Stephanie Pope has been appointed as the new leader of BCA. Pope has been serving as the chief operating officer of Boeing since January of this year. Prior to that, she held the position of president and CEO of Boeing Global Services, where she oversaw the company's aerospace services for commercial, government, and aviation industry customers worldwide.

As this story continues to develop, we will provide updates as more information becomes available. The departure of Boeing's CEO and the leadership changes within the company signal a need for stability and a renewed focus on safety. Boeing will undoubtedly face significant challenges in rebuilding its reputation and restoring trust among consumers and industry stakeholders.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1910140688.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-25 12:48:28,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/large-language-models-can-help-home-robots-recover-from-errors-without-human-help/,Large language models can help home robots recover from errors without human help,"Home robots have struggled to gain widespread success for a variety of reasons, including pricing, practicality, form factor, and mapping. Even when these issues are addressed, there is still the challenge of how robots handle mistakes. This has been a problem in the industrial sector as well, but larger companies have the resources to address these problems. However, it is not feasible to expect consumers to learn programming or hire someone to help with every issue that arises.

Fortunately, a new study from MIT showcases the potential of using large language models (LLMs) to address this problem. The study, which will be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations, aims to introduce ""common sense"" into the process of correcting mistakes.

According to MIT, robots are excellent at mimicking actions, but they often lack the ability to adjust to unexpected situations. Traditionally, when a robot encounters an issue, it will exhaust its pre-programmed options before requiring human intervention. This poses a particular challenge in a home environment, where changes to the surroundings can impact a robot's ability to function.

The researchers behind the study highlight that while imitation learning is popular in the field of home robotics, it often fails to account for the small variations in the environment that can disrupt regular operation. As a result, the robot needs to start the task from the beginning. The new research addresses this issue by breaking demonstrations into smaller subsets instead of treating them as a continuous action.

This is where LLMs come into play. They eliminate the need for programmers to manually label and assign numerous subactions. LLMs can provide instructions for each step of a task in natural language. The researchers aim to connect the continuous demonstration by a human with the physical embodiment of those steps, enabling the robot to know its current stage in a task and autonomously replan and recover.

The study features a demonstration where a robot is trained to scoop marbles and pour them into a bowl. While this is a simple task for humans, it consists of multiple small tasks for robots. The LLMs can list and label these subtasks. During the demonstrations, researchers purposely sabotaged the activity by bumping the robot off course and knocking marbles out of its spoon. However, the system was able to self-correct the small tasks instead of starting from scratch.

""We don't need to ask humans to program or give extra demonstrations of how to recover from failures,"" explains grad student Tsun-Hsuan Wang.

This research offers a promising approach to help robots recover from mistakes without requiring human intervention. It provides a more efficient and intuitive way for robots to adapt to unexpected situations and continue their tasks. By leveraging LLMs, home robots can become more reliable and user-friendly, enhancing their potential for widespread adoption.

In conclusion, the use of large language models in robotics offers a solution to the challenge of handling mistakes. By incorporating ""common sense"" into the process of correcting errors, robots can self-correct and recover from failures without the need for human intervention. This research from MIT demonstrates the potential of LLMs in improving the functionality and practicality of home robots. As advancements continue to be made in this field, we can expect to see more intelligent and adaptable robots in our homes in the future.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/CommonSense-01-press_0.jpg?w=900,2024-03-25 20:01:06,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/fisker-trading-suspended-by-nyse/,Fisker trading suspended by NYSE,"The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) made an announcement on Monday that it will suspend the trading of EV startup Fisker's shares and proceed to remove the company from its stock exchange. According to the NYSE, Fisker's stock is no longer suitable for listing due to abnormally low price levels. This decision comes after Fisker received a warning from the NYSE a month ago, stating that its stock price had been trading below $1 for 30 consecutive days, which violates the exchange's rules.

Fisker does have the opportunity to review the NYSE's determination, but in a filing made on Monday afternoon, the company stated that it expects its stock to be moved to an over-the-counter market, such as OTC Pink. Additionally, Fisker revealed that the delisting has triggered repayment clauses in two outstanding loans that it is currently unable to afford, potentially having a significant negative impact on the business.

It has been a tumultuous day for Fisker, as its shares fell more than 28% before trading was halted. Earlier on Monday, the company announced the loss of a potential deal with a major automaker, rumored to be Nissan. This development has also put into jeopardy a recently announced attempt to secure emergency funding.

Fisker did not provide an explanation for why the automaker terminated the negotiations, which was a critical closing condition for a potential $150 million convertible note that was announced last week. The company stated in the filing that it will request the unnamed investor to waive the closing condition.

Fisker has been facing a multitude of problems over the past few months, including customer complaints, lawsuits, and federal investigations. The struggling EV startup has had difficulty selling its Ocean SUV, falling short of its own internal sales goals. In January, TechCrunch reported that Fisker shifted away from a direct sales model and began relying on dealerships to boost sales. The company has also been grappling with quality issues, which it has struggled to address, as revealed in internal documents.

In February, Fisker laid off around 200 employees, accounting for 15% of its staff. Last week, the company reported having only $121 million in its bank account. Fisker has halted production and warned investors that it will not survive another year without a fresh injection of cash.

This story has been updated to include details from Fisker's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday afternoon.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fisker-GettyImages.jpg?resize=1200,800",2024-03-25 21:06:18,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/fisker-nissan-deal-dead-funding-bankruptcy/,"Fisker loses potential Nissan deal, putting rescue funds at risk","The negotiations between Fisker, an electric vehicle (EV) startup, and a large automaker have come to an end, putting the company's near-term funding efforts at risk. Fisker, in a regulatory filing on Monday, revealed that the automaker, believed to be Nissan, terminated the negotiations on March 22. Although the reason for the termination was not explained, Fisker had to continue these negotiations as part of the closing conditions for a potential $150 million convertible note announced the previous week. Fisker plans to request that the unnamed investor waive this closing condition.

The news of the terminated negotiations had a significant impact on Fisker's stock, causing it to plummet by 28% after the stock market opened. Trading was subsequently halted. This development adds to the growing list of challenges faced by Fisker. The startup has struggled to sell its Ocean SUV, failing to meet its internal sales goals. As a result, Fisker had to shift away from a direct sales model. Additionally, some delivered vehicles have been plagued by quality issues, which have proven difficult for the company to address.

Fisker's financial situation has also been precarious. In February, the company laid off around 200 employees, accounting for 15% of its staff. As of last week, Fisker reported having only $121 million in its bank account. With production on pause, the company has warned investors that it would not survive another year without a substantial cash infusion. While Fisker had engaged in discussions with other automakers, including Mazda, only Nissan remained in active negotiations.

In light of the terminated negotiations with Nissan, Fisker announced on Monday that it is exploring alternative options. These options include potential tie-ups with other companies, as well as various financial strategies such as restructuring in or out of court, capital market transactions (subject to market conditions), debt refinancing, equity issuance, asset and business sales, and other strategic transactions.

Despite these setbacks, Fisker remains determined to find a path forward. The company is actively seeking opportunities to secure the funding it needs and exploring potential partnerships that could provide the necessary support. While the termination of negotiations with Nissan is undoubtedly a setback, Fisker is committed to pursuing other avenues to ensure its survival and success in the EV market.

In conclusion, Fisker's negotiations with a large automaker, suspected to be Nissan, have been terminated, jeopardizing the startup's near-term funding efforts. Fisker is facing challenges with its sales, quality issues, and financial stability. However, the company remains resilient and is actively seeking alternative options to secure funding and partnerships. Despite this setback, Fisker is determined to find a path forward in the competitive EV market.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1236611991.jpg?resize=1200,759",2024-03-25 13:52:11,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/elon-musk-x-ccdh-california-lawsuit-dismissed/,A judge just killed Elon Musk's lawsuit against an anti-hate research org,"Federal Judge Dismisses Lawsuit Against Nonprofit Researching Online Hate

A federal judge has ruled against Elon Musk and X in a lawsuit targeting a nonprofit organization that focuses on researching online hate. Last year, X sued the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), accusing them of spreading misleading claims through a series of reports on hate and extremism on their platform. In response, Musk and X claimed that they lost millions of dollars directly as a result of the CCDH's research. They also accused the CCDH of illegally scraping data and violating the platform's rules by aggregating content through a third-party social media monitoring tool called Brandwatch.

CCDH CEO Imran Ahmed accused Musk of intentionally prolonging the legal process to increase the organization's legal costs. However, United States District Judge Charles R. Breyer granted the CCDH's motion to dismiss the lawsuit, stating that it was evident that X's true purpose in bringing the case was to punish the CCDH for criticizing their company. Judge Breyer also denied Musk and X the opportunity to reopen the case.

The CCDH, founded in 2018, conducts research on hate speech, extremism, and misinformation on major social networks. Their reports often highlight disturbing content across various platforms, including TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram. They aim to hold social media companies accountable for their decisions that impact democracy, human rights, and civil liberties.

After the ruling, CCDH CEO Imran Ahmed expressed his satisfaction, stating that the courts had affirmed their right to research, speak, and advocate for change. He emphasized the importance of holding social media companies accountable for their actions. The nonprofit's legal team, led by Roberta Kaplan, celebrated the decision, highlighting that even the world's wealthiest man cannot manipulate the rule of law to his advantage. Kaplan recently achieved a significant victory in the E. Jean Carroll defamation suit against former President Donald Trump.

Although the CCDH has achieved success in California, Musk is pursuing a similar lawsuit against the left-leaning media watchdog Media Matters for America. However, unlike the CCDH lawsuit, X is suing Media Matters for America in Texas, which does not provide the same protections against frivolous lawsuits that stifle free speech as California does.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/twitter-x-logo-musk-pattern.jpg?resize=1200,675",2024-03-25 20:33:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/match-board-directors-after-talks-activist-investor-elliott-management/,Match appoints two board directors after talks with activist investor Elliott Management,"Tinder-owner Match Group has recently made some significant changes within its organization. The company has announced the appointment of two new board members and has entered into an agreement with activist investor, Elliott Management. Laura Jones, the Chief Marketing Officer at Instacart, and Spencer Rascoff, co-founder of Zillow, will be joining Match Group's board of directors with immediate effect.

According to Match Group, these appointments are the result of a ""constructive dialogue"" with Elliott Management. The two companies have agreed to share information and work together to find ways to improve Match Group's performance. This news comes after The Wall Street Journal reported that Elliott Management had acquired a stake of approximately $1 billion in the company.

Elliott Management's interest in Match Group stems from concerns about the company's declining number of paying users, particularly in the face of economic uncertainty. However, the activist investor also sees significant potential for value creation in Match Group, as it is recognized as the global leader in online dating.

Marc Steinberg, a partner at Elliott Management, expressed confidence in Match Group's potential and praised the collaboration with the company's management and board. He believes that the addition of Laura Jones and Spencer Rascoff to the board will bring unique skills and perspectives that will support Match Group's growth in the future.

Elliott Management has gained a reputation for its activism in the tech industry, often acquiring stakes in companies and pushing for changes. Match Group is the latest company to experience this, following similar board shakeups at Crown Castle and Etsy.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, Match Group reported a 5% decrease in the number of total paid users compared to the previous year, with a total of 15.2 million users. The company's growth has slowed down from the peak it reached during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a significant decline in its stock price, which has dropped by 79% from its 2021 peak.

Match Group is the parent company of several well-known dating apps, including Tinder, Hinge, Match.com, Meetic, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, and OurTime, among others. These apps have become increasingly popular in recent years, as more people turn to online dating to meet new people and form connections.

With the appointment of Laura Jones and Spencer Rascoff to its board of directors, Match Group aims to leverage their expertise and perspectives to navigate its next phase of growth. The company recognizes the importance of adapting to changing market dynamics and maintaining its position as the global leader in online dating. By working closely with Elliott Management and fostering a collaborative environment, Match Group hopes to overcome its current challenges and achieve renewed success in the future.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1241790742.jpeg?w=1024,2024-03-25 14:15:04,Innovation,Innovation

Originally designed as a four-walled projection, the triptych was presented on three big screens, creating an immersive experience. Powered by Stable Diffusion, a local version of the text to image generator, The Golden Key automatically created themed images based on unrelated fairy tales. Charlie Fink, the mastermind behind the project, had to bring in extra power and cooling to accommodate the servers. Guests were even given the opportunity to add their own prompts, witnessing their ideas come to life in real time. Although the three-screen presentation was captivating, one can only imagine the incredible impact of the original four-walled concept. The lightning-fast version of Stable Diffusion generated images from fairy tales, while guests contributed their own twists to the evolving narrative. It felt like a whole new medium was unfolding right before our eyes. Directed by Marc Da Costa and Matthew Niederhauser, The Golden Key was a revelation and a testament to the innovative spirit of SXSW.

Da Costa and Niederhauser also presented another remarkable project at the Venice Film Festival called Tulpamancer. This interactive experience allowed participants to encounter a tulpa, a thought-form or imaginary companion, through a series of questions about their own lives. After typing out their responses, participants were invited to immerse themselves in a virtual world prepared uniquely for them. Guided by their tulpa, they embarked on a journey through a series of virtual scenes that invoked and questioned their memories and potential fates. Tulpamancer was a thought-provoking exploration of the human psyche, blurring the line between reality and imagination.

Among the other notable projects in the XR experience area, Soul Paint stood out and received a Special Jury Award. Written and directed by Sarah Ticho, and produced by Anna Firbank, Soul Paint was a visually stunning and emotionally captivating experience. Another remarkable piece was Astra, created by Eliza McKnitt. Set in space like her previous award-winning project, Spheres, Astra took audiences on a breathtaking journey through the cosmos. Impulse, on the other hand, shed light on the experiences of individuals living with ADHD. Both experiences utilized Mixed Reality, seamlessly blending the real world with the digital realm through outward-facing HD cameras.

Reimagined Volume III: Young Thang, a VR animation series, showcased lesser-known fables, mythology, and folklore. Produced by a female-led team, this anthology series brought to life a new kind of storybook experience. Shadowtime, another Venice selection, offered a poetic contemplation of escapism and real-world threats, such as climate change. Detachment, a satiric VR experience by Ristband, provided audiences with a cinematic journey that delved into the complexities of script programming.

Ristband, known for their multidimensional mixed reality concerts, returned to SXSW with their Future x Music event. This year, they featured an ambisonic A/V installation by Venice Bleach, spatial audio by Sphere of Sound, violins by Alexander Parsons, and scent by Timothy Han. The event showcased their critically acclaimed mixed reality concert performed by the band Pivots, as well as performances from international artists such as Glasser, Moritz Simon Geist, Minimal Schlager, and Kikuo.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/lesliekatz/2024/03/25/artists-get-early-access-to-openais-sora-video-tool-with-surreal-results/,OpenAI Gave Artists Early Access To Sora. See The Videos They Created,"""Air Head"" is a short film that showcases the creative potential of OpenAI's generative AI tool, Sora. Created by Toronto-based multimedia production company, Shy Kids, the film introduces us to a character with a balloon for a head. While the film has a surreal twist, it highlights Sora's ability to generate realistic and imaginative content.

Shy Kids expresses their excitement about Sora's capability to create surreal content. The protagonist in ""Air Head"" humorously acknowledges his anatomical anomaly, stating that he is ""literally filled with hot air."" We witness the challenges he faces, such as his head blowing off in windy conditions or the prickly encounters he has in a cactus-filled plant store. However, he maintains a grateful perspective, recognizing that we are all vulnerable to deflation.

OpenAI introduced Sora to the public in mid-February as a generative AI tool that can produce one-minute videos based on a single text prompt. Although Sora is not yet available as a product, OpenAI is actively working to assess its capabilities, limitations, and risks. The feedback and creations from early testers, including Shy Kids and OpenAI's first artist in residence, Alexander Reben, play a crucial role in this evaluation process.

While generative AI continues to provoke various reactions, ranging from excitement about its creative potential to concerns about job displacement and intellectual property theft, the initial responses from artists and filmmakers granted early access to Sora lean towards enthusiasm. Josephine Miller, creative director of Oraar Studio, praises the tool for its ability to challenge her creative process and elevate storytelling. Her film transports viewers into a dreamy subaquatic world where individuals gracefully move wearing garments adorned with iridescent fish-like scales. Like Miller's creation, many of the highlighted films blur the lines between reality and unbridled imagination.

Don Allen Stevenson III, the creator of another film showcased by OpenAI, emphasizes that Sora is not bound by traditional laws of physics or conventional thinking. He appreciates how the tool has shifted his focus from technical hurdles to pure creativity, allowing for instant visualization and rapid prototyping. The collection of seven short films also includes a captivating compilation by Nik Kleverov, co-founder and creative director of Native Foreign. Kleverov sees Sora as a transformative tool that enables him to explore original concepts that were previously limited by budgetary and resource constraints.

In Kleverov's film, we witness a black-and-white noir scene, a sepia-toned clock repair shop, and even a futuristic sportscar emerging from the depths of the ocean. The film is a testament to Sora's ability to unlock new possibilities and inspire creators to push the boundaries of their imagination.

Overall, the early creations made using Sora demonstrate the tool's potential to revolutionize the creative process. Although there are still improvements to be made, OpenAI is excited about the impact Sora could have in helping creatives bring their ideas to life. As the evaluation continues, the company is committed to refining Sora's capabilities and addressing any concerns that may arise.

The future of generative AI is both thrilling and uncertain, but the early experiences with Sora suggest that it has the power to enhance creativity and storytelling in remarkable ways.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660206f5826dc2b2a5012a5a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1530,918,x225,y165,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 19:50:18,Innovation,Innovation
