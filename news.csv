Here's the good, the bad, and the ugly","DevOps engineering is a highly sought-after profession in today's job market. However, breaking into this role requires a combination of technical expertise and business acumen. Moreover, staying relevant in this field demands a commitment to continuous learning, as popular approaches and technologies can quickly become outdated.

The demand for DevOps engineers, who are responsible for automating and coordinating both cloud and on-premises environments to ensure the seamless development and deployment of software, is on the rise. And it comes with a hefty paycheck. In the United States, for instance, the average annual salary for a DevOps engineer is estimated to be around $134,000, according to Talent.com.

But being a DevOps engineer is not without its challenges, as experienced professionals point out. To begin with, this role requires a solid understanding of foundational technologies. Brad Morgan, a seasoned DevOps engineer, emphasizes the importance of learning Linux. Regardless of the specific tasks involved in a DevOps role, Linux is at the core of it all. Having a strong background in Linux is a must, understanding its basics, working with the terminal, and being familiar with essential commands.

Another crucial skill that DevOps engineers should possess is bash scripting, which automates Linux commands. As Morgan explains, bash scripting is widely used in the DevOps world, especially in building pipelines. Therefore, mastering this skill is essential for success in this field.

Cloud skills are also highly valued in the DevOps profession. Morgan suggests that aspiring DevOps engineers should focus on learning one cloud provider at a time, rather than trying to become proficient in all of them. By specializing in a specific cloud vendor, such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure, professionals can enhance their employability and ease the learning process.

However, becoming a DevOps engineer does not necessarily require following a formal course or obtaining a specific certification. Morgan believes that self-learning is the best approach for a successful career in this field. Constantly acquiring new knowledge and challenging oneself is essential in a rapidly evolving industry like DevOps.

Homebrew Henry, another experienced DevOps engineer, echoes this sentiment. In a recent YouTube presentation, he emphasizes the importance of continuous learning for DevOps engineers. The DevOps ecosystem is vast and constantly evolving, with tools and frameworks that were popular yesterday being replaced by new alternatives. Therefore, DevOps engineers must dedicate their free time to studying and staying up to date with the latest developments in the field.

Even with experience, the learning never stops for DevOps engineers. Henry highlights that this aspect is actually one of the things that DevOps professionals love most about their job. With the rapid pace of technological advancements, including the introduction of AI tools like ChatGPT, the role of DevOps engineering will undoubtedly continue to evolve in the coming years.

Infrastructure management is a significant aspect of a DevOps engineer's job and may differentiate passionate professionals from their peers. Those who enjoy managing infrastructure will thrive in this role, as it involves setting up, configuring, and maintaining the cloud infrastructure that supports various applications. This includes dealing with servers, databases, networks, and security on a daily basis. DevOps engineers find excitement in this aspect, as it allows them to witness the magic of their work in action.

However, for individuals who are more inclined towards software engineering, writing Terraforms, CI/CD pipelines, and automation scripts may not satisfy their coding itch. Building customer-facing applications may provide a different kind of fulfillment. The good news is that transitioning between software engineering and DevOps is entirely feasible, and many professionals have successfully made the switch.

Lastly, it's crucial to consider the business side of DevOps. Unrealistic expectations for the role can create challenges. Businesses often believe that hiring a few DevOps engineers will magically solve all their problems. However, DevOps is a complex and multifaceted discipline that requires a comprehensive understanding of the organization's goals and processes. DevOps engineers must bridge the gap between technology and business, ensuring that the DevOps strategy aligns with the company's overall objectives.

In conclusion, becoming a DevOps engineer is an exciting and rewarding career choice. However, it requires a strong foundation in technology, a commitment to continuous learning, and the ability to manage infrastructure effectively. DevOps professionals must constantly adapt to new tools and frameworks, staying up to date with the latest industry trends. By embracing these challenges and continuously expanding their skill set, DevOps engineers can excel in their roles and contribute to the success of their organizations.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/e4d3d8d263eb00323161fcf2566ad35a3fe52282/2024/03/25/1b8b924e-2629-43c2-b416-1b990e262786/gettyimages-1319039490.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericsiegel/2024/03/25/ai-success-depends-on-how-you-choose-this-one-number/,AI Success Depends On How You Choose This One Number,"AI: Making Operational Decisions Smarter

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize operational decision-making. From determining whom to contact or approve, to deciding who to investigate or medicate, AI can play a crucial role. However, there is a critical step in the AI process that is often overlooked: choosing the decision threshold. This single number differentiates the ""yeses"" from the ""nos"" and is essential for AI to function effectively.

Setting the decision threshold is not a technical decision, but a strategic one. It is the part that aims the rocket, rather than the rocket science itself. When making this choice, businesses must consider practical tradeoffs between competing objectives. Let's explore why this is so important.

Understanding AI as a Likelihood Calculator

When we talk about AI, we are primarily referring to machine learning (ML), which is the technology behind AI. ML uses data to predict outcomes and drive operational decisions. It learns from data to make predictions about whether someone will click, buy, lie, or even die. These predictions have a significant impact on various operational processes.

The ML use cases we are discussing here are known as predictive AI or predictive analytics. Unlike generative AI, which has dominated headlines recently, predictive AI focuses on improving large-scale operations. It has the potential to deliver substantial efficiencies and improvements to businesses.

While ML cannot predict perfectly, it offers the next best thing: likelihoods. Each predictive model generated by ML can be seen as a ""likelihood calculator."" It assigns a score to each individual case, indicating the chances of the predicted outcome. These scores, or probabilities, can then be used to determine actions.

Transforming Likelihood Scores into Actions

To turn likelihood scores into actions, businesses often need to set a decision threshold, also known as a confidence threshold. This threshold represents the level of confidence required for an action to be taken. For example, a marketing project might set the threshold at 30%: if a customer is more than 30% likely to buy, they will receive a marketing brochure.

By making this one choice, businesses empower AI to make millions of decisions. However, the decision threshold is where the real difference is made. It determines how the predictive model will drive decisions and significantly influences the bottom-line improvements that can be achieved. In fact, the choice of threshold often has a greater impact on project value than changes to the model development itself.

The Importance of Choosing the Right Threshold

Let's consider the example of payment card fraud detection. A predictive model is used to decide whether to authorize or hold each transaction. The threshold chosen determines which transactions are held for further investigation. However, the choice of threshold involves tradeoffs.

For instance, a medium-sized bank might set a threshold that blocks the 3% most risky transactions, successfully preventing 220,000 cases of fraud per month. However, this approach also inconveniences customers by erroneously blocking legitimate transactions 77,000 times in the same period. On the other hand, if the bank chooses a more lenient threshold and only blocks the top 2% of transactions, there would be fewer inconveniences (around 17,600) but also less fraud prevention (around 180,000 cases). These figures are approximate results based on using XGBoost, a popular ML solution, on a public dataset of credit card transactions.

Each predictive AI project offers a range of trade-offs and options. By setting the decision threshold, businesses can determine the balance they wish to strike. However, making this choice requires strategic thinking. Regardless of how well the predictive model is developed or how well the ML software performs, business leaders must weigh in on the pivotal decision of setting the decision threshold.

One Model, Multiple Options

By tuning the decision threshold, businesses can utilize each predictive model developed by their data scientists in various ways. The threshold determines how actions are prioritized and how resources are allocated. It answers questions like, how many transactions are worth investigating as potential fraud? How many customers are worth contacting with a marketing campaign, considering that a lower threshold means reaching out to prospects who are less likely to buy? How many credit applications should a bank approve?

In conclusion, AI has the power to drive millions of operational decisions, but it requires strategic decision-making to be effective. Choosing the decision threshold is a crucial step that should not be overlooked. By setting the threshold, businesses can empower AI to make smarter decisions and achieve significant improvements in operational efficiency. The choices made in this process can have a profound impact on the success of AI projects.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600f86863ceebda28e9989e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 09:40:04,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/24/nvidia-could-be-primed-to-be-the-next-aws/,Nvidia could be primed to be the next AWS,"Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) may seem like unlikely companions, but they share several similarities in their growth trajectories. Both companies stumbled upon their core businesses almost by accident. AWS realized it could sell the services it had developed for internal use, while Nvidia discovered that its gaming GPU was well-suited for AI workloads.

This realization led to explosive revenue growth for both companies. Nvidia's revenue skyrocketed from $7.1 billion in Q1 2024 to $22.1 billion in Q4 2024, with the majority of the growth coming from its data center business. While AWS didn't experience the same level of growth, it has consistently been a major revenue driver for Amazon. However, Microsoft and Google have entered the market, creating the Big Three cloud vendors, and other chip makers are expected to gain market share in the future.

Both Nvidia and AWS were in the right place at the right time. As web apps and mobile technology emerged, the cloud provided on-demand resources, and enterprises saw the value of moving workloads to the cloud. Similarly, the rise of AI and large language models coincided with the increased use of GPUs for processing these workloads.

AWS has become a highly profitable business, with a run rate close to $100 billion. However, its growth has started to slow down, while Nvidia's growth is accelerating. Nvidia's challenge is to sustain this growth and become a long-term revenue powerhouse like AWS. While Nvidia has other businesses, they are smaller and growing more slowly than the GPU data center business.

In the short term, Nvidia's revenue growth has been astronomical. The company expects $24 billion in revenue for the current quarter, a 234% increase compared to the previous year's first quarter. However, growth rates are expected to decline as the company faces tougher comparisons. Analysts predict $110.5 billion in revenue for the current fiscal year, an 81% increase from the previous year, but lower than the 126% gain in the previous fiscal year.

Despite the expected slowdown, Nvidia is still projected to scale its revenue past the $100 billion annual run rate mark for several quarters. The company sees significant growth opportunities ahead, driven by AI and competition from other chipmakers. While competition will intensify, Nvidia's dominant position in the market gives it room to maneuver.

Ultimately, AI could be the driving force behind Nvidia's continued growth in the coming years. Although competition will increase, Nvidia's current market control and momentum should help it maintain its position. While AMD is gaining ground at the board level, Nvidia remains firmly in control at the chip level.

In conclusion, Nvidia and AWS have experienced remarkable growth due to their timely entry into the market and the demand for their respective services. While AWS's growth has slowed down, Nvidia's revenue continues to soar. The future holds both challenges and opportunities for Nvidia, but its strong position in the market and focus on AI should help sustain its growth in the years to come.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-902417454.jpg?resize=1200,788",2024-03-24 15:00:17,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2024/03/25/apple-secretly-engineering-iphone-for-game-changing-update-to-apple-pay-report-claims/,"Apple Secretly Engineering iPhone For Game-Changing Update, Report Claims","The Department of Justice recently filed a lawsuit against Apple, and one of the key elements of the case revolves around the NFC chip in the iPhone. This chip powers Apple Pay, a convenient and secure payment system that Apple has closely guarded. However, it seems that Apple may be preparing to change its stance on this issue.

According to Mark Gurman of Bloomberg, the NFC chip access has already changed in the European Union, and it may soon change in the United States as well. The NFC chip is what enables users to make quick and effortless payments by simply tapping their phone on a card reader. Apple's tight control over access to this chip is motivated by security and privacy concerns. By keeping it locked, Apple ensures that bad actors cannot gain access to users' financial information.

There is another factor at play here as well. By maintaining exclusive control over the NFC chip, Apple can charge royalties on each transaction made through Apple Pay. If third-party finance companies were allowed to use the chip, they could charge their own royalties, cutting Apple out of the equation. This has been a longstanding issue, and Gurman previously reported on it almost two years ago. Apple's policy has prevented companies like PayPal, Square, and major financial institutions from launching tap-to-pay apps with their own features and interfaces. If they want to access the iPhone user base, they must pay a fee for every Apple Pay credit card transaction.

It's clear that Apple has valid reasons for wanting to keep the NFC chip locked. The company wants to ensure the security and safety of its users, protect its own royalties, and maintain its reputation as a trusted and secure payment platform. However, recent developments in the European Union may be forcing Apple's hand.

In early March of this year, the European Union introduced the Digital Markets Act, which included a condition requiring Apple to offer access to the NFC chip. Initially wary due to security concerns, Apple reluctantly agreed to comply. Behind the scenes, Apple is now preparing for a potential shift in its policy. Gurman reports that engineering work to open up NFC access in the United States is already underway.

While there is no specific timetable for when this change may occur, it is clear that Apple is taking steps to prepare for it. It is likely that Apple hopes to avoid implementing this change altogether, but it is proactively getting ready in case it becomes necessary. If the transition goes smoothly in the European Union, it could pave the way for a similar change in the United States in the months or years to come.

In conclusion, Apple's control over access to the NFC chip in its iPhones has been a contentious issue for some time. The company has cited security and financial reasons for keeping the chip locked. However, recent developments in the European Union have prompted Apple to reconsider its stance. Although Apple is preparing for potential changes, there is no definitive timeline for when this may occur in the United States. It remains to be seen how this shift will impact Apple Pay and the broader mobile payment landscape.","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6601869f70d828f8cfe50372/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3662,2060,x0,y591,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",2024-03-25 10:15:49,Innovation,Innovation

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/lucid-motors-1-billion-saudi-arabia-gravity-suv/,Lucid Motors raises another $1 billion from Saudi Arabia as it searches for luxury EV buyers,"Lucid Motors, the luxury electric vehicle manufacturer, is securing an additional $1 billion in funding from its major investor, Saudi Arabia. The aim of this funding is to alleviate the high costs associated with the production and sale of its high-end electric sedan. The announcement was made in a regulatory filing on Monday, revealing that Ayar Third Investment, an affiliate of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, will purchase $1 billion worth of Lucid's stock. This investment will increase the Kingdom's ownership stake to approximately 60%.

This new funding comes shortly after Lucid informed investors that it plans to manufacture approximately 9,000 units of its Air electric vehicles this year, a slight increase compared to the previous year's production. In 2023, the company reported a loss of $2.8 billion and ended the year with nearly $1.4 billion in cash and equivalents. Lucid has encountered challenges in finding buyers for its expensive Air sedan and has resorted to reducing prices multiple times in recent months to stimulate sales. Additionally, the company intends to commence production of its electric Gravity SUV by the end of the year.

Interestingly, Lucid's decision to accept further investment from Saudi Arabia comes in light of CEO Peter Rawlinson expressing caution about relying heavily on the Kingdom for funding. In an interview with the Financial Times, Rawlinson emphasized the importance of not assuming unlimited financial support from the Public Investment Fund (PIF) of Saudi Arabia. He stated, ""If I adopt a mindset that there is bottomless wealth from PIF, that is very dangerous, that is something I will never do, I respect them far too much for that.""

By securing this additional funding, Lucid Motors aims to address the financial challenges inherent in the production and sale of its luxury electric vehicles. With the support of its major investor, Saudi Arabia, the company seeks to overcome obstacles in attracting buyers for its high-priced vehicles. Despite the hurdles faced, Lucid Motors remains committed to expanding its product lineup, with plans to introduce the electric Gravity SUV later this year.

https://venturebeat.com/ai/companies-are-about-to-waste-billions-on-ai-heres-how-not-to-become-one-of-them/,Companies are about to waste billions on AI - here's how not to become one of them,"Join us in Boston on March 27 for an exclusive night of networking and insightful conversations about data integrity. Request an invite here.

""It's venture money, not adventure money."" That was the response a friend received from a venture capitalist while pitching an idea. However, during the hype cycle of a new technology, caution tends to be thrown out the window. Venture capitalists need to invest the capital they raised, and the cost of missing out on a big opportunity is higher than the downside of taking a swing and missing, especially when everyone else is doing the same.

This dynamic also plays out within companies, especially when it comes to AI and anything associated with it. Large language models (LLMs) are considered AI, as is machine learning (ML). Suddenly, projects that were previously denied funding can be rebranded as AI projects and given another chance.

Billions of dollars will be wasted on AI in the next decade. This may sound contrary, but it is the reality of every big technology wave. We get excited before fully understanding its true transformative potential. Search, social media, and mobile have had a lasting impact, but virtual reality (VR) and crypto have been more limited in their reach.

Five years ago, the headlines were filled with promises of AI changing everything. Companies are now rushing to show how much they are investing in AI and its potential. This shotgun approach to investing often results in a few successful ventures and many failures. VCs and company leaders are driven by the fear of missing out and the hope of finding the next big thing.

However, this doesn't diminish the fact that LLMs are a game-changing technology. Just look at how quickly ChatGPT reached 100 million users compared to other transformative companies. Almost every enterprise company is leveraging LLMs and AI in some way. The question is, how do you decide where to invest and where you have the potential to succeed?

To make informed decisions and cut out wasted spending, consider these three factors:

1. Understand the total cost over time: Before saying yes to an AI project, evaluate the resources required to sustain it, both in terms of present and future costs. Often, the work of a data science team requires additional engineering, DevOps, QA, product, and SysOps time. Many projects fail because they lack ongoing investment. While saying no to an AI initiative can be difficult, frequently saying yes can come at the expense of fully funding projects that are worth supporting in the long run. Additionally, using AI without generating sufficient downstream value can eat into your margins and negatively impact customer satisfaction.

2. Ask why others can't do it: In the tech industry, there are monopolies and commodities. When considering an AI initiative, question why your company is the right fit for it. Working on something that commoditizes over time can be challenging, especially without the advantage of scale or cost. Instead, focus on areas where you have a defensive moat, such as preferential access to data, proprietary insights, or an application with strong network effects.

3. Make a few strategic bets: Sometimes, the best bets are the ones that improve your existing business. As the BASF commercial says, ""We don't make the things you buy, we make the things you buy better."" If applying AI can enhance your products or services, it is a worthwhile investment. It is important to see these bets through and provide momentum to your business.

In conclusion, AI is a transformative technology, but it also comes with risks and challenges. By understanding the total cost, evaluating your competitive advantage, and making strategic bets, you can navigate the AI landscape with more clarity and avoid wasted spending.

The game's performance has been closely monitored, especially on PlayStation where it briefly claimed the top spot upon launch. However, on Xbox, it struggled to break into the top 20 and quickly dropped out of the top 50. Steam has been even less forgiving, with a lackluster launch compared to Marvel's Avengers and consistently low player counts. Currently, Suicide Squad sits at the 1,011th spot for best-selling games on the platform. Its viewership on Twitch has also dwindled significantly since launch, from 155,177 to a mere 65.

These numbers paint a grim picture, and the game desperately needs a miraculous surge in popularity. While Suicide Squad boasts positive user scores and commendable combat mechanics, its main storyline suffered due to the focus on building live content. Players are tasked with fighting 13 different Brainiac variants, which can become tiresome. Additionally, despite unique character designs, the combat moveset for all squad members remains largely similar.

Monetization is another concern. Like the ill-fated Avengers game, Suicide Squad offers heroes for free and relies on cosmetic battle passes for revenue. While player-friendly, this model may not generate substantial profits. A small playerbase means fewer players will engage with new live content, and even fewer will be willing to spend on cosmetic upgrades when characters like Joker are already available at no cost.

The future of Suicide Squad hangs in the balance. The game's lackluster post-launch support, including a dearth of helpful balance patches and prolonged player lockouts, has not helped its cause. If the Joker fails to captivate players and turn the tides, it is unlikely that the game will survive the year, let alone complete its planned four seasons of content.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/adrianbridgwater/2024/03/25/the-ever-changing-face-of-software-modernization/,The Ever Changing Face Of Software Modernization,"GIZA, EGYPT - In recent years, software has been undergoing a process of modernization. This shift towards cloud-native infrastructures has revolutionized applications for both enterprise and consumer use. However, the challenge with software modernization is that it must constantly adapt to remain up-to-date. What was considered modern last year may no longer be relevant today. The rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a perfect example of how rapidly technology can evolve.

To predict future tech trends, the IT industry relies on reports, surveys, and analysis initiatives that provide quantifiers, qualifiers, and identifiers. These insights help us understand the changing landscape of IT. Red Hat's recent ""State of Application Modernization Report,"" conducted in collaboration with research firm Illuminas, reveals some interesting findings. While enterprise application containers were previously seen as the future, this report suggests a shift towards Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines as the top priority for software modernization in the always-on world of connected cloud.

Another company at the forefront of software modernization is Nutanix, a multi-cloud platform provider. Their sixth global Enterprise Cloud Index (ECI) survey predicts a doubling in the adoption of hybrid multi-cloud models over the next few years. In this context, hybrid multi-cloud refers to a combination of private on-premises cloud, public cloud services provided by hyperscalers, and services that span both worlds. This approach allows organizations to leverage the benefits of multiple cloud providers based on factors such as price, data governance, and technical requirements.

The motivation behind software modernization varies, but AI, security, and sustainability are among the key drivers. As businesses increasingly prioritize AI, investment in AI strategy has become the top priority for IT decision-makers. This is closely followed by investment in IT modernization, as organizations face pressure to update their infrastructure quickly.

Moving applications and data across different environments can be complex, which is why the Nutanix report emphasizes the use of hybrid multi-cloud infrastructure. Security and innovation were identified as the main drivers for transitioning applications between environments in the past year. To meet these evolving demands, 80% of survey respondents plan to invest in IT modernization, and 85% plan to increase their investment in AI strategy.

Overall, software modernization is an ongoing process driven by the need to adapt to new technologies, improve security, and enhance sustainability. As organizations navigate the complexities of hybrid multi-cloud environments, they must prioritize investment in AI and IT modernization. By doing so, they can ensure their IT infrastructure remains efficient and up-to-date in an ever-changing digital landscape.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660181597188fb59284d9023/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 10:28:24,Innovation,Innovation
