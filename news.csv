https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-vulnerability-virtual-reality.html,Vulnerability in virtual reality systems identified,"Virtual reality (VR) systems have opened up a whole new world of possibilities, allowing users to immerse themselves in virtual environments. However, a team of computer scientists from the University of Chicago has uncovered a potential vulnerability in these systems that could have serious consequences. They have published a paper on the arXiv preprint server, detailing their findings and describing what they call an ""inception layer.""

The concept behind this vulnerability is that hackers could insert an app into a user's VR headset, tricking them into revealing sensitive information. The inception layer acts as a barrier between the user and the virtual world they see when using their VR device. This layer could record information, intercept and alter data, or even add fake elements to the VR world, all without the user's knowledge.

For example, a hacker could record a passcode entered into a virtual ATM or modify the amount of money designated for a purchase, routing the difference to their own bank account. They could also create virtual representations of the user's friends or family to gain trust or access to personal secrets. In essence, this app has the potential to monitor and manipulate a user's gestures, voice, browsing activity, and social or business interactions.

To test the feasibility of this vulnerability, the research team enlisted the help of 28 volunteers who played a game using a demonstration VR headset. They downloaded the app onto the devices, simulating a hacking scenario, and then asked the volunteers if they had noticed anything unusual. Only 10 of the volunteers noticed a slight flickering during the download and activation process, and just one of them questioned whether something malicious was happening.

Upon discovering this vulnerability, the research team promptly notified Meta, the company behind the Meta Quest VR system used in the experiment. Meta has acknowledged the findings and confirmed that they will investigate the issue and take appropriate action if necessary. The researchers also emphasize that similar vulnerabilities are likely to exist in other VR systems and apps that aim to insert themselves between users and their VR devices.

This discovery serves as a reminder that even virtual worlds can be infiltrated by hackers seeking to exploit unsuspecting users. As VR technology continues to advance, it is crucial for companies and developers to prioritize security and regularly update their systems to protect users from potential threats. By staying vigilant and proactive, we can ensure that the immersive experiences offered by VR remain safe and enjoyable for all.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/vulnerability-in-virtu.jpg,2024-03-25 10:20:02,Innovation,Innovation
https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-liquid-iron-battery-grid-energy.html,New all-liquid iron flow battery for grid energy storage,"A New Battery Design Revolutionizes Large-Scale Energy Storage

Energy storage is a crucial aspect of modernizing the U.S. electric grid and incorporating renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. Researchers at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have made a breakthrough in this field with their innovative battery design. By repurposing a commonplace chemical used in water treatment facilities, they have created a safe, economical, water-based, flow battery that utilizes Earth-abundant materials. This new design provides a pathway for the integration of intermittent energy sources into the nation's electric grid.

The researchers published their findings in Nature Communications, highlighting the remarkable performance of their lab-scale, iron-based battery. The battery exhibited outstanding cycling stability over one thousand consecutive charging cycles, maintaining 98.7% of its maximum capacity. In comparison, previous studies on similar iron-based batteries reported degradation of charge capacity two orders of magnitude higher over fewer charging cycles.

Iron-based flow batteries have been in existence since the 1980s, with some commercially available options. However, what sets this battery apart is its unique liquid chemical formula. It combines charged iron with a neutral-pH phosphate-based liquid electrolyte, known as nitrogenous triphosphonate or NTMPA. The crucial factor is that NTMPA is readily available in industrial quantities since it is commonly used to inhibit corrosion in water treatment plants.

NTMPA belongs to a chemical family called phosphonates, which are based on the element phosphorus. Many phosphonates dissolve well in water and are non-toxic, finding applications in fertilizers and detergents, among other uses. Therefore, the use of NTMPA in this battery design not only ensures safety but also relies on easily accessible and environmentally friendly materials.

Flow batteries operate differently from conventional batteries. They consist of two chambers filled with different liquids. Through an electrochemical reaction, the batteries charge and store energy in chemical bonds. When connected to an external circuit, they release the stored energy, which can then power electrical devices. Unlike traditional batteries, flow batteries feature two external supply tanks of liquid that constantly circulate through them, serving as the battery system's ""blood supply."" The capacity of the flow battery depends on the size of the electrolyte supply tank.

Flow batteries have the potential to serve as backup generators for the electric grid and play a significant role in decarbonization strategies. They can be built at various scales, from lab-bench size to the size of a city block. Grid operators are particularly interested in locating battery energy storage systems (BESS) in urban or suburban areas near energy consumers. However, safety concerns often arise in these scenarios. The aqueous flow battery design developed by the PNNL researchers addresses these concerns by operating in water at neutral pH. This characteristic enhances safety and makes it suitable for urban environments.

The research team also highlighted the advantage of using commercially available reagents that have not been previously investigated for use in flow batteries. This aspect opens up new possibilities for the future development and optimization of this battery design.

Although the initial design falls slightly behind in energy density compared to commercialized vanadium-based systems, there is significant potential for improvement. The PNNL researchers achieved an energy density of up to 9 watt-hours per liter (Wh/L) with their current design. In comparison, commercial vanadium-based systems boast an energy density of 25 Wh/L. While higher energy density allows for more energy storage in a smaller space, the use of Earth-abundant materials in the PNNL design makes it scalable to provide the same energy output.

This revolutionary battery design holds great promise for large-scale energy storage. It combines safety, cost-effectiveness, and the utilization of readily available materials. As researchers continue to optimize and refine this design, it could play a vital role in modernizing the electric grid and facilitating the integration of renewable energy sources into our energy systems.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/new-all-liquid-iron-fl.jpg,2024-03-25 07:22:25,Innovation,Innovation

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-deep-geothermal-renewable-powerhouse.html,Dig deep: US bets on geothermal to become renewable powerhouse,"Geothermal energy has the potential to become a significant source of clean and reliable power in the United States. While it currently represents a small fraction of the country's energy production, businesses and the Biden administration are optimistic about its future. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm believes that if the heat beneath our feet can be harnessed effectively, geothermal energy could surpass hydroelectric and solar power by 2050.

Geothermal energy utilizes the high temperatures found underground to generate electricity and heat buildings. However, it only accounted for 1.6 percent of US energy consumption in 2022. To address this, the US government has invested over $200 million in an experimental site in Utah. This project focuses on Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), which involve drilling exceptionally deep wells and injecting water into hot rocks to generate geothermal energy. Unlike traditional geothermal methods, EGS does not require nearby hot springs or underground reservoirs.

The potential for geothermal energy is not limited to specific locations. Analyst Francesco d'Avack explains that geothermal energy can theoretically be generated anywhere, which reduces the upfront risk for investors. The US government is also streamlining the process for companies to convert permits for oil or gas exploration into geothermal licenses, reducing paperwork and delays.

Compared to hydraulic fracturing (fracking), which is used to extract oil and natural gas, EGS involves fewer chemical additives and does not release hydrocarbons. Furthermore, geothermal energy provides a steady flow of power regardless of weather conditions or time of day, unlike solar or wind power.

One of the significant advantages of geothermal energy is its potential for cost reduction. The US government estimates that the cost per megawatt hour (MWh) will decrease from the current range of $70 to $100 to $45 by 2035. The use of existing drilling technology makes geothermal development quicker and more cost-effective. This innovative application of drilling technology has been a game-changer for geothermal energy.

While other countries, such as France, have experimental EGS sites, the US has been at the forefront of this new technology. However, the potential for induced seismic activity is a concern, similar to what has been observed in fracking projects. The US Energy Department has implemented a mitigation protocol to address induced seismicity and is funding research on the matter.

The market for geothermal energy is gaining momentum, with several US and Canadian start-ups raising significant investments. Companies like Fervo Energy have connected their geothermal sites to the electric grid and have attracted partnerships with industry giants such as Google. As demand for geothermal energy increases, more companies are expected to enter the market.

Cindy Taff, CEO of Sage Geosystems, believes that the geothermal energy sector is still in its early stages and that the first successful commercial facility will pave the way for further growth. As the sector expands, it is crucial to prioritize responsible and sustainable development.

In conclusion, geothermal energy holds great promise as a clean and reliable power source for the future. With advancements in technology and government support, geothermal energy has the potential to play a significant role in the green transition. By harnessing the heat beneath our feet, we can unlock a sustainable and efficient energy solution for industries and households alike.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/a-worker-operates-a-dr.jpg,2024-03-25 04:59:03,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/swift-planning-launch-new-central-bank-digital-currency-platform-12-24-months-2024-03-25/,SWIFT planning launch of new central bank digital currency platform in 12-24 months,"SWIFT, the global bank messaging network, has announced plans to create a new platform that will connect central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to the existing finance system. This move is significant for the CBDC ecosystem, as SWIFT plays a crucial role in global banking. The platform is expected to be launched in the next one to two years, aligned with the release of major CBDCs.

Currently, around 90% of central banks worldwide are exploring the development of digital versions of their currencies. They aim to keep up with the rise of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin while grappling with the complexities of implementing new technologies.

SWIFT's head of innovation, Nick Kerigan, stated that their latest trial, which involved a 38-member group of central banks, commercial banks, and settlement platforms, was one of the largest collaborations on CBDCs and tokenized assets to date. The trial focused on ensuring interoperability between different countries' CBDCs, even if they were built on different underlying technologies or protocols. This reduces the risk of payment system fragmentation and enables complex trade and foreign exchange payments to be made more efficiently and cost-effectively.

Kerigan expressed that the trial's results were deemed successful by participants, demonstrating that banks can use their existing infrastructure for CBDC transactions. This success has provided SWIFT with a timeline to work towards, aiming to launch the platform as a product within the next 12-24 months.

However, the timeline may be subject to change if CBDC launches by major economies are delayed. Nevertheless, being prepared for the launch of CBDCs would be crucial for SWIFT to maintain its dominance in the bank-to-bank network. Some countries, such as the Bahamas, Nigeria, and Jamaica, already have operational CBDCs, while China is conducting real-life trials of its e-yuan. The European Central Bank is also working on a digital euro, and the Bank for International Settlements is running cross-border trials.

SWIFT's existing network, currently used by over 11,500 banks and funds in more than 200 countries, gives the company a significant advantage. This extensive network enables trillions of dollars to be transferred daily, making SWIFT a trusted player in the global banking industry.

The recent rise in SWIFT's prominence can be attributed to its actions in 2022 when it disconnected most Russian banks from its network as a response to Western sanctions following the invasion of Ukraine. Although a similar move could be made in the new CBDC system, Kerigan believes it would not deter countries from participating.

The recent trial involved central banks from various countries, including Germany, France, Australia, Singapore, the Czech Republic, and Thailand. Some participants requested anonymity. Additionally, heavyweight commercial banks such as HSBC, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, Societe Generale, Standard Chartered, and the CLS FX settlement platform took part. Two Chinese banks were also involved.

The envisioned interlink solution would allow banks to have one global connection point for digital asset payments, rather than setting up individual connections with each counterparty. This would streamline the process and make it more efficient.

Furthermore, Kerigan highlighted a forecast from the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) that predicts around $16 trillion worth of assets could be tokenized by 2030. Tokenization involves transforming assets like stocks and bonds into digital chips that can be issued and traded in real-time. By integrating various networks into the SWIFT system, the industry would benefit from a more scalable option.

In conclusion, SWIFT's plan to create a platform connecting CBDCs to the existing finance system is a significant development in the CBDC ecosystem. With the majority of central banks exploring digital currencies, SWIFT aims to facilitate interoperability and streamline payment processes. The successful trial has provided a roadmap for SWIFT, and they plan to launch the platform within the next 12-24 months. This initiative would solidify SWIFT's position as a key player in global banking and enable banks to handle digital asset payments more efficiently.",https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UUDGY355ONLBXGONVFMQTN5QUY.jpg?auth=939bafd8676ab83c7a68c4a343248be9cc30e197d22f24e54a6cda618c66d336&width=1920&height=1005&smart=true,2024-03-25 18:44:59,Innovation,Innovation

https://techxplore.com/news/2024-03-semiconductors-scale-processor-remarkable-speedup.html,Semiconductors at scale: New processor achieves remarkable speedup in problem solving,"Annealing processors have significant implications for various practical applications such as logistics, resource allocation, and drug and material discovery. These processors are specifically designed to address combinatorial optimization problems by finding the best solution from a finite set of possibilities. However, the complexity of the coupling in these processors directly affects their scalability.

In a recent study led by Professor Takayuki Kawahara from Tokyo University of Science, researchers have developed a scalable annealing processor that divides the calculation into multiple LSI chips. This innovative processor was successfully tested and presented at the IEEE 22nd World Symposium on Applied Machine Intelligence and Informatics.

The goal of this research is to achieve advanced information processing directly at the edge, rather than relying on cloud resources or performing preprocessing at the edge for the cloud. The Tokyo University of Science previously announced a unique processing architecture in 2020, which allowed them to create a fully coupled LSI on a single chip using 28nm CMOS technology. In 2022, the team devised a scalable method using parallel-operating chips and demonstrated its feasibility using FPGAs.

The scalable annealing processor developed by the team utilizes 36 22nm CMOS calculation LSI chips and one control FPGA. This technology enables the construction of large-scale semiconductor systems following the Ising model with 4096 spins. The processor incorporates two distinct technologies developed at the Tokyo University of Science: the ""spin thread method"" that enables 8 parallel solution searches and a chip reduction technique that reduces chip requirements by about half compared to conventional methods. It operates at a power consumption of 2.9W (1.3W for the core part) and a frequency of 10MHz.

In terms of power performance ratio, the processor outperforms simulating a fully coupled Ising system on a PC using annealing emulation by a factor of 2,306. It also surpasses the core CPU and arithmetic chip by a factor of 2,186. The successful machine verification of this processor suggests the possibility of enhanced capacity.

Professor Kawahara envisions the social implementation of this technology, including initiating a business, joint research, and technology transfer. The goal is to develop this technology for an LSI system with the computing power of a 2050-level quantum computer for solving combinatorial optimization problems. The aim is to achieve this without the need for air conditioning, large equipment, or cloud infrastructure using current semiconductor processes. By 2030, the team hopes to achieve 2 million spins and explore the creation of new digital industries.

In summary, the researchers have developed a scalable, fully coupled annealing processor with 4096 spins on a single board using 36 CMOS chips. Key innovations, such as chip reduction and parallel operations for simultaneous solution searches, have played a crucial role in this development.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/fisker-nissan-deal-dead-funding-bankruptcy/,"Fisker loses potential Nissan deal, putting rescue funds at risk","The negotiations between Fisker and a large automaker, which was reported to be Nissan, have come to an end. This development has put the near-term rescue funding effort of Fisker in jeopardy. In a regulatory filing on Monday morning, Fisker revealed that the automaker terminated the negotiations on March 22. However, the company was required to keep the negotiations going in order to meet the closing conditions for a potential $150 million convertible note that was announced last week. Fisker plans to ask the unnamed investor to waive this closing condition.

Following this news, Fisker's stock plummeted by 28%, resulting in trading being halted. This is just the latest setback for the struggling electric vehicle (EV) startup. Fisker has been facing challenges in selling its Ocean SUV and has fallen short of its internal sales goals. As a result, the company has had to shift away from a direct sales model. Additionally, there have been quality problems with some of the cars that have been delivered, and Fisker has struggled to address these issues.

In February, Fisker laid off around 200 employees, which accounted for 15% of its staff. The company also reported having only $121 million in the bank last week. Fisker has paused production and has warned investors that without a fresh infusion of cash, it will not survive another year. While Fisker had discussions with other automakers, such as Mazda, it seems that only Nissan remained at the negotiating table.

Despite the setback with Nissan, Fisker announced that it is exploring other ""strategic alternatives"" to the potential tie-up. This includes considering in or out of court restructurings, capital market transactions, repurchases, redemptions, exchanges, refinancings of existing debt, potential issuance of equity securities, sale of assets and businesses, and other strategic transactions or measures.

The termination of negotiations with Nissan is undoubtedly a blow to Fisker. However, the company remains determined to find a way forward. With its future hanging in the balance, Fisker is exploring all available options to secure the funding it needs to continue its operations.

It is clear that Fisker is at a critical juncture. The fate of the company rests on its ability to secure fresh investment and navigate these challenging times. As the EV market continues to grow and evolve, it is crucial for Fisker to find a path forward that allows it to capitalize on the opportunities in this industry.

In conclusion, Fisker's negotiations with a large automaker, believed to be Nissan, have been terminated. This puts the company's near-term rescue funding effort in jeopardy. Fisker is evaluating other options and considering various strategic alternatives to move forward. The future of the company hangs in the balance, and it is crucial for Fisker to secure the necessary funding to continue its operations and thrive in the competitive EV market.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1236611991.jpg?resize=1200,759",2024-03-25 13:52:11,Innovation,Innovation

https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewwight/2024/03/25/how-are-scientists-saving-colombias-delicious-native-palm-species/,How Are Scientists Saving Colombia’s Delicious Native Palm Species,"Colombia, known for its rich biodiversity, is home to a vast array of palm species. However, over 200 of these species are currently at risk of extinction. Among the endangered palms are the Taparo palm and the Chontaduro, both of which hold cultural and economic significance, particularly in the central and southern regions of the country.

To combat the decline of these species, Alberto Gomez Mejia, a botanist and founder of the Quindio Botanical Garden, and his team are working to establish a gene bank that will protect the genetic diversity of these palms. They also plan to reintroduce some examples into the wild and develop sustainable commercial plantations.

With the largest collection of palms in Colombia, Gomez Mejia and his team are dedicated to saving the native food palms that are in danger. They will collaborate with locals to help preserve wild populations, collect population data on the palms, and study their reproduction in the central Andes.

Gomez Mejia's journey into conservation was unconventional. After studying law and teaching philosophy, he became interested in ecology in 1972, following the Stockholm Conference on the human environment. This newfound passion led him to become the ""Ecologist Mayor"" of Armenia, serving as mayor twice during his twenties.

As a university professor, Gomez Mejia has attended numerous national and international events on conservation. He emphasizes the importance of harnessing the biological diversity of the Global South, particularly the unknown flora that holds potential for food, medicine, handicrafts, and ornamental plants. He believes that education is the key to understanding and preserving the country's biodiversity, ultimately leading to a better quality of life for its people.

In addition to the efforts of Gomez Mejia and his team, another Colombian researcher has made an exciting discovery. A new plant species, Glossolomamagenticristatum, has been found in the Cordillera Oriental of the Colombian Andes. However, this species faces a specific threat from roadside maintenance, which periodically disturbs its habitat. The ongoing decline of Andean forests due to colonization and agriculture also poses a global risk to this unique plant.

To protect and conserve Colombia's native species, Laura Clavijo, an assistant professor at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia, emphasizes the need to understand the country's biodiversity, its distribution, and the factors affecting its evolution. Collaborating with local communities is crucial in developing effective conservation and management strategies.

In conclusion, Colombia's palm species are facing a significant threat of extinction, but dedicated individuals like Alberto Gomez Mejia and Laura Clavijo are working tirelessly to protect and preserve them. Through gene banks, reintroduction efforts, and community involvement, they aim to ensure the survival of these culturally and economically important palms. The exploration of Colombia's rich biodiversity holds great potential for the country's future, and education plays a crucial role in fostering a love and appreciation for its natural treasures.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/660196dcec2b8dcfcc90103a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-03-25 18:24:36,Innovation,Innovation
https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-favorite-linux-text-editors-and-why-you-should-be-using-one/,My favorite Linux text editors (and why you should be using one),"Linux has a rich history of text editors, with the infamous editor wars between emacs and vi being a prominent part of that history. However, the landscape of text editors has evolved over time, and they are no longer limited to configuring Linux or writing code. Today, text editors have become versatile tools that can be used for various purposes, including note-taking, journaling, and even writing novels. While I have never used a text editor to write a full-length book, I have found them to be invaluable for writing short stories and flash fiction.

In this article, I will introduce you to some of the best text editors available for Linux. Before we dive in, I want to clarify that this list does not include vi or Emacs. While both of these editors are incredibly powerful, I have found them to be more of a hindrance than a help. They are not designed for everyday use or for the average user, which is why I have chosen to focus on more user-friendly options.

One of my go-to text editors is nano. Despite its simplicity, nano has been my preferred choice for decades. It provides all the essential features I need in an editor without overwhelming me with unnecessary extras. With nano, you can create simple flat text files without any formatting. It offers interactive search-and-replace, undo/redo functionality, syntax coloring, smooth scrolling, auto-indentation, go-to-line-and-column-number, feature toggles, file locking, and internationalization support. Nano is a terminal application, so you would need to open the terminal and issue the command ""nano filename"" to edit or create a file. It is free and comes pre-installed with most Linux distributions.

Another noteworthy text editor is Gedit, which is the default text editor for the GNOME desktop. Gedit is a basic yet effective GUI application that offers features such as tabs, support for internationalized text (UTF-8), syntax highlighting, markdown support, configurable fonts and colors, print support, auto-save, auto backup, keyboard shortcuts, theming, and full-screen mode. What I appreciate most about Gedit is its simplicity. While I generally prefer nano, Gedit is my go-to GUI editor when I need one. Additionally, Gedit can be used in fullscreen mode, allowing you to edit text files without distractions. Gedit is free and ships with most GNOME-based desktop distributions.

If you're looking for a text editor that is specifically designed for the upcoming COSMIC desktop by System76, COSMIC Text Editor is worth considering. Although COSMIC Text Editor is not officially released yet, it already shows great promise. It offers features like syntax highlighting, standard keyboard shortcuts, find functionality, spellcheck, project support, revert changes, document statistics, and even Git management support. COSMIC Text Editor's interface features a dark theme, which adds to its appeal. It is a simple yet powerful editor that can be used for basic tasks as well as writing code. COSMIC Text Editor will be available for free when the COSMIC Desktop OS is released.

For users of the KDE Plasma desktop, Kate is the equivalent of Gedit. Kate offers a few additional features compared to Gedit, including multi-cursor and multi-cursor selection, which allows you to select and manipulate multiple strings of text simultaneously. It also provides project support, syntax highlighting, standard keyboard shortcuts, and plugins. With the plugin feature, you can add functionality such as SQL query support, GDB debugging, and one-click project build. Kate is like a supercharged version of Gedit that can handle more complex tasks while still being suitable for simple text editing. Like the other text editors mentioned, Kate is free and available for use.

In conclusion, Linux offers a variety of text editors that cater to different needs and preferences. Whether you prefer a simple and lightweight editor like nano, a user-friendly GUI editor like Gedit, a text editor designed for a specific desktop environment like COSMIC Text Editor, or a feature-rich editor like Kate, you can find a suitable option for your Linux workflow. These text editors provide the essential tools for writing, editing, and managing text files, making them valuable assets for any Linux user.",https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/feda4ca65eefc13df0e3505780d84330ecd3c713/2024/03/25/d964a97e-9c56-444a-9497-19bc7ca26a56/typingclosegettyimages-1341060766.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,2024-03-25 00:00:00,Innovation,Innovation

Canoo stated that the acquired assets will be sent to its facility in Oklahoma. Arrival had previously announced plans to sell off assets and intellectual property from its UK division after filing for bankruptcy protection. Canoo, which has had its own struggles, went public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company. The company has reported over $1 billion in its sales pipeline but has faced challenges converting those sales into deliveries.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/canoo-walmart-arkansas.jpg?resize=1200,670",2024-03-25 22:15:20,Innovation,Innovation
https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/gostudent-tutoring-profitability/,"GoStudent, the online learning platform, says it's now profitable","GoStudent, an online tutoring marketplace based in Vienna, Austria, has become one of the most successful startups in the region. With 11 million families and 23,000 tutors on its platform, GoStudent has now achieved profitability. CEO Felix Ohswald stated that the company is not only EBITDA profitable but also has positive operating cash flow. This accomplishment is significant for an Austrian startup, given the challenges faced by many companies in the technology industry during the pandemic.

GoStudent's journey to profitability has not been without obstacles. Like many other technology companies, it experienced a market crash due to the sudden shift towards remote and virtual experiences. Cash burn became a major issue, and customer demand dropped significantly. In 2021, the company lost €89 million, which increased to €220 million in 2022. This led to several rounds of layoffs and cost cuts.

The company's rapid growth from zero to over €100 million in revenue within two years was impressive but came at a high cost. Despite raising significant funding, GoStudent realized that it needed to change its approach to sustain growth. In 2023, it reduced its burn rate by 70%, but further adjustments were necessary. The company underwent restructuring and made tough decisions to cut expenses, such as eliminating extravagant parties, pausing acquisitions, and refraining from expanding into new markets.

The impact of the pandemic on the education sector played a significant role in GoStudent's success. As schools shifted to remote learning, the demand for online tutoring increased. GoStudent went from having to convince parents of the benefits of online tutoring to becoming the go-to solution for students needing educational support.

To achieve profitability, GoStudent had to make strategic changes. It decided to focus on Europe and adopt a more organic growth strategy outside of German-speaking countries. The company exited the US market and shifted its focus to bottom-line growth rather than top-line growth. GoStudent's goal is to become the leading global platform for personalized tutoring and unlock the potential of every student.

Balancing growth and cost control will be a challenge for GoStudent. While it aims to scale at lower costs, it must also maintain a personalized approach to meet the needs of its customers. GoStudent is currently a tutoring platform but is evolving into a more comprehensive educational solution. Its acquisition of Studienkreis in 2022, a company with physical learning centers, allows GoStudent to offer hybrid learning experiences. The company believes that the future of education is hybrid and aims to leverage technology to connect students with the right tutors regardless of location.

Most of GoStudent's tutors are university students, which makes it easier for them to connect with students and provide effective tutoring. This younger demographic brings fresh perspectives and approaches to teaching and learning.

Overall, GoStudent's journey to profitability showcases its ability to adapt and overcome challenges. By focusing on its core business, implementing cost-saving measures, and leveraging technology, the company has positioned itself as a leader in the online tutoring market. Its commitment to personalized education and hybrid learning sets it apart from competitors and ensures its continued success in the future.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/25/london-regtech-gss-raises-47m-to-help-banks-screen-for-global-sanctions/,London regtech GSS raises $47M to help banks screen for global sanctions,"Global Screening Services (GSS), a London-based regulatory compliance platform, recently announced that it has raised $47 million in funding. This news comes at a time when economic sanctions are on the rise, with the United States imposing trade restrictions and asset blocking against countries like Russia, China, and Iran.

GSS was founded by Tom Scampion, who previously served as the head of financial crime for Deloitte's EMEA arm. In 2020, Scampion left Deloitte to become a general partner at consulting firm AlixPartner. It was during his time at AlixPartner that GSS was initially incubated before being spun out as a standalone entity in 2021.

Last year, GSS secured a similar amount of funding from prominent investors, including Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), one of the largest banks in the world. For its latest funding round, GSS has attracted the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) as a new backer, along with Cynosure Group and AlixPartner.

Financial institutions, such as banks, often face challenges when it comes to enforcing sanctions, as they play a crucial role in controlling the flow of money globally. However, identifying who is sending money to whom can be a complex task. In 2019, Standard Chartered was fined $1.1 billion by regulators in the UK and the US for lacking adequate money-laundering controls and violating sanctions against countries like Iran. Similarly, in 2014, BNP Paribas was fined a staggering $8.9 billion for processing financial transactions for countries under US sanctions.

Given these challenges, investors have shown a growing interest in regulatory compliance businesses in recent years. Companies like New York-based Droit and London's SteelEye have also secured significant funding to support their compliance solutions.

GSS offers a sanctions-screening platform that helps banks and other financial institutions comply with regulations. Users input transaction data into GSS's cloud-based platform, which then compares the data against a standardized set of sanctions lists from around the world. GSS also enhances these lists with additional data points, such as dates of birth and International Maritime Organization (IMO) numbers for ships. Additionally, GSS provides ""enhanced"" lists that include companies partially owned by individuals, companies, or governments that have been sanctioned by organizations like the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the European Union (EU), or the United Kingdom.

With the new funding secured, GSS is now transitioning from the development phase to becoming fully operational. The company is preparing to go live with its first customers, marking an important milestone in its journey.

In conclusion, GSS's recent funding round highlights the increasing importance of regulatory compliance in the financial industry. With the support of investors, GSS aims to help financial institutions meet their global sanctions obligations and navigate the complex landscape of regulatory requirements. As economic sanctions continue to shape the global business environment, solutions like GSS's screening platform are becoming essential tools for financial institutions to ensure compliance and mitigate risks.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1770041999-e1711386339681.jpg?resize=1200,677",2024-03-25 18:36:37,Innovation,Innovation
